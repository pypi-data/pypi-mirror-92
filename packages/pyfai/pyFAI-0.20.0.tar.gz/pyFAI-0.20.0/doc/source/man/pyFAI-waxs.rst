Integration tool: pyFAI-waxs
============================

Purpose
-------

Azimuthal integration for powder diffraction.

pyFAI-waxs is the script of pyFAI that allows data reduction (azimuthal integration) for
Wide Angle Scattering to produce X-Ray Powder Diffraction Pattern with output axis in 2-theta space.

Usage:
------
pyFAI-waxs -p param.poni [options] file1.edf file2.edf ...

Options:
--------
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -p PONIFILE           PyFAI parameter file (.poni)
  -n NPT, --npt NPT     Number of points in radial dimension
  -w WAVELENGTH, --wavelength WAVELENGTH
                        wavelength of the X-Ray beam in Angstrom
  -e ENERGY, --energy ENERGY
                        energy of the X-Ray beam in keV (hc=12.398419292keV.A)
  -u DUMMY, --dummy DUMMY
                        dummy value for dead pixels
  -U DELTA_DUMMY, --delta_dummy DELTA_DUMMY
                        delta dummy value
  -m MASK, --mask MASK  name of the file containing the mask image
  -d DARK, --dark DARK  name of the file containing the dark current
  -f FLAT, --flat FLAT  name of the file containing the flat field
  -P POLARIZATION_FACTOR, --polarization POLARIZATION_FACTOR
                        Polarization factor, from -1 (vertical) to +1
                        (horizontal), default is None for no correction,
                        synchrotrons are around 0.95
  --error-model ERROR_MODEL
                        Error model to use. Currently on 'poisson' is
                        implemented
  --unit UNIT           unit for the radial dimension: can be q_nm^-1, q_A^-1,
                        2th_deg, 2th_rad or r_mm
  --ext EXT             extension of the regrouped filename (.xy)
  --method METHOD       Integration method
  --multi               Average out all frame in a file before integrating
                        extracting variance, otherwise treat every single
                        frame
  --average AVERAGE     Method for averaging out: can be 'mean' (default),
                        'min', 'max' or 'median
  --do-2D               Perform 2D integration in addition to 1D

pyFAI-waxs is the script of pyFAI that allows data reduction (azimuthal
integration) for Wide Angle Scattering to produce X-Ray Powder Diffraction
Pattern with output axis in 2-theta space.
