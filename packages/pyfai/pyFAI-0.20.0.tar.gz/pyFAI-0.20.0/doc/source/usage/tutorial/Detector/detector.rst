Detector geometric distortions and corrections
==============================================

Those tutorials deal with distortion of detectors also called geometric distortion.
The first tutorial is about correcting distorted images, which is straight forwards in pyFAI when the detector is known. 
The subsequent ones are about measuring this distortion, often based on the image of a regular grid placed in front of the detector.
