Python programming API
======================

This chapter describes the programming interface of pyFAI, so what you can
expect after having launched *Jupyter notebook* (or ipython) and typed:

.. code-block:: python

	import pyFAI

The most important class is AzimuthalIntegrator which is an object containing
both the geometry (it inherits from Geometry, another class)
and exposes important methods (functions) like `integrate1d` and `integrate2d.
