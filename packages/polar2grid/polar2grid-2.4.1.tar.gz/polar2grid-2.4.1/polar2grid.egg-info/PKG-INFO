Description: Polar2Grid and Geo2Grid
        =======================

        Polar2Grid and Geo2Grid are a set of tools for extracting data from earth-observing satellite instruments,
        remapping it to uniform grids, and writing that gridded data to a new file format.
        As the names suggest, Polar2Grid is meant to operate on polar-orbiting satellite data and
        Geo2Grid on geostationary satellite data. Due to the projects sharing a lot of internal functionality
        their code bases are stored in the same code repository.
        Both projects are created by scientists and software developers at the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC) at
        the University of Wisconsin - Madison. Polar2Grid is distributed as part of the
        `Community Satellite Processing Package (CSPP) <http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/cspp/>`_ for
        processing of data received via direct broadcast antennas. Geo2Grid is distributed as part of the
        `CSPP Geo <http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/csppgeo/>`_ project for processing of data received via direct broadcast
        antennas. Although both projects were created to serve the direct
        broadcast community, they can be used on most archived data files.
        See the documentation for specific functionality.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        It is recommended that users use the official Polar2Grid/Geo2Grid release compatible
        with RHEL6+ systems whenever possible. This tarball is available through the
        CSPP team's website (see above). To install the Polar2Grid python package (used for Polar2Grid and Geo2Grid)
        from source, run::
        
            pip install .
        
        Other Installation Methods
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The "polar2grid" package that powers the official CSPP Polar2Grid and CSPP Geo
        Geo2Grid all-in-one tarballs is also released as a traditional python package
        on PyPI and conda-forge. Installing the package in this way allows Polar2Grid
        and Geo2Grid functionality to be used from non-Linux systems.
        The python package can be installed into your normal Python 3.8+
        environment by doing the following in a conda environment (recommended):
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            conda install -c conda-forge polar2grid
        
        Or with pip:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install polar2grid
        
        Once the package is installed the regular "geo2grid.sh" and "polar2grid.sh"
        scripts are available. For systems without the bash shell available there are
        also "geo2grid" and "polar2grid" wrapper scripts available. For example:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            polar2grid -h
        
        Contributing
        ------------
        
        Feel free to submit issues and pull requests on Github or contact us (see above) about more involved feature requests.
        We do ask that before you add features yourself or fix complex issues that you contact us in some way. Both projects
        are in active development and features and fixes are added all the time. Developers should see the
        `Developer's Guide <http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/software/polar2grid/dev_guide/>`_ for more information on the internals
        of both projects.
        
        Directories
        -----------
        
        The majority of Polar2Grid is written in python, but some of the components may use third-party C or Fortran binaries
        for various processing algorithms.
        To make it easier to create our CSPP distribution (aka the software bundle) and for any pure python users we provide
        the source for some of these executables in the root of the repository.
        
        - polar2grid: The Polar2Grid python package.
        - swbundle: Helper scripts and other files provided in the Polar2Grid Software Bundle released by the CSPP team.
        - modis_crefl: Copy of the MODIS Corrected Reflectance software (CREFL) that includes updates for building with Makefile
