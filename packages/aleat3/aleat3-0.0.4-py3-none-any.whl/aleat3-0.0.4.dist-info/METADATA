# Aleatoryous 3

This is the 3rth Generation of aleatory objects, built by Diego
Ramirez.

## Introduction

The Aleatoryous package allows you to build:

- Aleatory Syntax objects
  - Dice: aleatory.dice
  - Coin: aleatory.coin
  - Roulette: aleatory.roulette

By using the Python library [random](http://docs.python.org/3.8/library/random), Aleatoryous object can build many solutions
for problems where aleatory numbers or specific output are needed.

To enjoy the Aleatoryous materials, you must download the package from the [PyPi](http://pypi.org)
and install it with pip:

```
pip install aleat3_[version]_[platform].whl

pip install aleat3_[version]_[platform].taz.gz
```

### The story of Aleatoryous

Well, you might ask: "If this package is a 3rth generation of Aleatoryous project,
what about generations 1 and 2?".

The answer is that versions 1 and 2 can be called "beta versions" of final
package. Even when this versions where never released, they are incomplete or not
functional. So, don't worry: you are handling the best version of Aleatoryous.

## What's new in aleat3 0.0.4

- Minor bugs resolved:
  - Cleaner output
  - Faster operations
- Some variables deleted or recycled:
  - Variable `Aleatoryous.cache` deleted
  - Variable `Aleatoryous.it` deleted
  - Private variables recycled

## What's new in aleat3 0.0.3

At version 0.0.2, you could change the Aleatoryous mode by typing:

```python
obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.coin")

obj.mode = "Dice"
```

But now, **that operation is forbidden**, and the system might return a message
like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File .../-.py in <module>
    obj.mode = "Dice"
        ^
AttributeError: object "Aleatoryous" has no attribute "mode"
```

Instead of that, **use the new method _Aleatoryous.changemode()_**:

```python
obj.changemode("aleatory.dice")
```

Also, in version 0.0.3, you can get the mode name of your object:

```python
print(obj.getmode())
```

## Building Aleatory Objects

To import the aleat3 library, type:

```python
from aleat3 import *  # Call the whole aleat3 library
```

After aleat3 library is imported, type:

```python
obj = Aleatoryous()   # Build an aleatory coin by default
```

All 3 objects are built at the same way in Python. No matter the mode, you can
get aleatory output with methods:

```python
# Return: strings or integers
obj.single()         # Only one iteration
# Return: lists
obj.first_5()        # First 5 results
obj.first_10()       # First 10
obj.first_50()       # First 50
obj.first_100()      # First 100
obj.first_given(3)   # Iterate all the given times
```

Now, we give you a description of the items:

### *aleatory.coin*

The most simple mode of Aleatoryous. It can be called by 2 ways:

- Just typing `obj = Aleatoryous()`. The default "mode" is *aleatory.coin*.
- Being more specific, typing `obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.coin")`.

The *aleatory.coin* can return 2 different results:

- String "Head"
- String "Tails"

##### Using *CoinToBinary* function

If you want, you can convert the *string* output from *aleatory.coin* to *int*
output with the function `aleat3.coinToBinary` included in the " * " import.

Follow the example:

```python
from aleat3 import *
obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.coin")

result = obj.single()  # return only 1 value
print(coinToBinary(result))
```

### *aleatory.dice*

The second mode of Aleatoryous returns a range **between 1 and 6**, just like
traditional dices. If you want an *aleatory.dice*, type:

```python
obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice")
```

And, like traditional dices, **you could use more than one to get a larger result:**

```python
dice1 = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice")
dice2 = Aleatoryous("aleatory.dice")

res = dice1.single() + dice2.single() # returns a range between 2 and 12
print(res)
```

### *aleatory.roulette*

The third and the most complex mode of Aleatoryous.
__This is the only mode that takes both parameters__ of Aleatoryous object:

```
Aleatoryous(mode, extras)
```

The **mode** parameter is taken by all the 3 modes. But the **extras** is only made
for *aleatory.roulette*. There you put a list of possible results. The list can have
any Python data structure, it will be iterated.

Follow the example:

```python
# Put your options here
lst = ["Option 1",
       {"Sub Option 1": 2, "Sub Option 2": None},
       10.9,
       [3, 4, 1],
       None]

# Build the object
obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", lst) # The 2nd parameter is taken
print(obj.single())
```

#### Debugging *aleatory.roulette* errors

Remember, **you can only include lists in the "mode" parameter.** For example,
if you type:

```python
obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", {"Option 1": 1, "Option 2": 2}) # A dictionary
```

You'll receive a message like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File .../-.py in <module>
    obj = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", {"Option 1": 1, "Option 2": 2})
                                            ^
File .../aleat3/constructor.py in __init__
    raise ...
aleat3.constructor.InitError: __init__() Invalid Syntax (Unexpected parameter given: extras)
```

## Making solutions with Aleatoryous - Some examples

### Iterating with _aleatory.roulette_

The most used mode is *aleatory.roulette*, because you can control data to be
iterated in aleatory selection.

For example, if you read a file and want to get a random line:

```python
# The file register.txt will contain many-many-many names. We want 5 aleatory
# winners:

# John
# Richard
# Tamara
# Axel
# Gael
# Sarah

f = open("C://Users/Admin/Documents/register.txt", "r")
l = []

for i in f:
  l.append(i.rstrip())

# Operate the file data
from aleat3 import *

r = Aleatoryous("aleatory.roulette", l)
res = []

while len(res) < 5:
  possible = r.single()
  if possible in res:
    continue
  res.append(possible)

# Get the results
print(res)
```

And we'll get an output like:

```
["Richard", "Gael", "John", "Tamara", "Sarah"]
```

### Binary aleatory numbers with _aleatory.coin + coinToBinary_

As we said before, the *coinToBinary* function converts an *aleatory.coin* output
to binary numbers (1 or 0). We can use this function when you need an aleatory
output between 1 and 0. View the _Using coinToBinary function_ process shown above.

### Building games with _aleatory.dice_

You could use the *aleatory.dice* natural properties for building complex games
where a dice is required.

For example, you can use the [tkinter](http://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tkinter) module for building
graphical interfaces, and then use the *aleatory.dice* to create a videogame where
the user can use a functional and light-weight dice.
