run.sh tests segway-winner to ensure that the correct set of parameters is chosen from a pre-determined segway run. 

The winners should be:
traindir/params/input.9.master
traindir/params/params.9.params.3


make-genomedata.sh creates the genomedata archive used by the command in segway_command.txt to generate the touchstone/traindir file. Note that regular expressions were added manually after the command in segway_command.txt was run.
