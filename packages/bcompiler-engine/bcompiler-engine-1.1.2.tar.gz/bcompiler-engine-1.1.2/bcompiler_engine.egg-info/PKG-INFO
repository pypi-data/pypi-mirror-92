Description: ## bcompiler-engine
        
        ![Tests](https://github.com/hammerheadlemon/bcompiler-engine/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master)
        [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/yulqen/bcompiler-engine/badge.svg?branch=typechecking)](https://coveralls.io/github/yulqen/bcompiler-engine?branch=typechecking)
        
        A new, faster, more efficient, more modular back end for
        [Datamaps](https://datamaps.twentyfoursoftware.com), and for newer tools and improved interfaces.
        
        A library that allows for controlled extraction and insertion of data to and
        from spreadsheets used for collecting data. Part of a more modular overall
        design, `bcompiler-engine` focuses on speed, simplicity and data validation. It
        forms the primary back-end to
        [datamaps](https://datamaps.twentyfoursoftware.com), and will
        eventually have a suitable API making it easy for anyone designing an
        application to use the datamaps philosophy - more on that coming soon.
        
        ### Highlights
        
        * Brand new code, developed with the benefit of several years and multiple projects
            of hindsight.
        * Extract data using multiple cores to do it faster.
        * Caching
        * Type checking and rule-setting, allowing for greater confidence in integrity of data.
        * Improved, modular design, powering *a brand new interface*, available soon.
        * Designed to be packaged for more general distribution.
