This screener uses Donchian Channels, Average True Range, and other inputs to determine if a stock, future or other financial instrument with timeseries (OHLC) may breakout out of its defined channel.

Required data:

-Pandas dataframe containing index as datetime and columns (High, Low, Open, Close) as float
-Define the number of breakout periods (default: 55 periods)
-Average True Range (ATR) window (default: 14 periods)
-ATR multiple (default: 1.5)- sensitivy used to determine a level at which the alert will provide a positive signal

The response returned is a tuple of the signal and a plotly chart: (signal, chart) create_chart=False is default. The signal is one of three options: 1, -1, 0

1 - Possbile breakout to go long
-1 - Possible breakuot to go short
0 - Too far from either price channel

Dependencies:

-ta
-plotly
