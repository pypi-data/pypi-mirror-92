LtsFit is a Python implementation of the method described in Section 3.2 of
`Cappellari et al. (2013a) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.432.1709C>`_
to perform **very robust** fits of lines or planes to data with errors in all
coordinates, while allowing for possible intrinsic scatter.
Outliers are iteratively clipped using the robust Least Trimmed Squares (LTS)
technique by `Rousseeuw & van Driessen (2006)
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10618-005-0024-4>`_.
