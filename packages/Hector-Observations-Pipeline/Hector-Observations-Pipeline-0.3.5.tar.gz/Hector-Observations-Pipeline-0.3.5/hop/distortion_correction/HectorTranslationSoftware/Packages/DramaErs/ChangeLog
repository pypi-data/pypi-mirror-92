Tue Dec 08 15:06:20 2020 <ks@Keiths-MacBook-Pro.local>  DramaErs version: 3.19

    Tried to set up a way of building Ers simply on systems without a DRAMA
    installation. Created a new Standalone directory. In this I generated the
    two messgen-generated files (using the latest DRAMA messgen), Ers_Err.h and
    Ers_Err_msgt.h,together with a CONTENTS file saying more or less what this
    says here. At top level I added a Makefile.standalone file.

    It should be possible to build a standalone version of Ers using
                   "make -f Makefile.standalone"
    - this doesn't release any files, but it builds a libers.a.

    This has now been tested under OS X (High Sierra) and Linux (on aaolxp)

    Note that if anyone decides to define a new ERS error code in Ers_Err.msg,
    they should regenerate the various messgen-created files in Standalone:
    cd Standalone
    messgen -c -o -t ../Ers_Err.msg

Tue Aug 18 11:33:48 2020 <tjf@aaolxp.aao.gov.au>  DramaErs version: 3.18

	Ensure release target builds.

Tue Aug 18 08:37:23 2020 <tjf@aaolxp.aao.gov.au>  DramaErs version: 3.17

      Remove all the DPUBLIC, DPROTOTYPES etc. macros - presume modern C compiler.

      Add sprintftest.c, and a test target in dmakefile.  This allows us to do
	basic tests on ErsSPrintf() and ErsSVPrintf().

	Need to add more tests 	here to check rest of ERS, but do to handle not 
	building with DRAMA.
	
      Replace BSD version of ErsVSPrintf() by the use of the modern portable
	implementation - vsnprintf().  ErsVSPrintf() and ErsSPrintf() both
	now call that routine for the formatting.  As well as removing the 
	BSD license code, this will ensure we are as up to date as the OS is in
	terms of printf() formatting support.
	
Tue Oct 25 13:25:48 2016 <instswtest@Yosemite-VM-On-aaomc39so.local>  DramaErs version: 3.16

       Add ERS___M___NOFMT flag, allows internal DRAMA code which was using
	ERS_M_NOFMT and still needs to (for compatiblity isues) to avoid
	the deprecated warning.  

      Move from finite() to isfinite() since finite() has been deprecated.

Thu Sep 03 13:13:43 2015 <tjf@aaolxp.aao.gov.au>  DramaErs version: 3.15

	In the previous change, the check on the use of ERS_M_NOFMT was faulty, picked
        up by CLang.  Now fixed.

Tue Aug 18 08:03:03 2015 <tjf@aatlix.10.80.10.9>  DramaErs version: 3.14

	Starting to get into lots of trouble due to ERS_M_NOFMT flag and checks
	in modern complers which complain if you don't have a format string.   Add
	ErsRepNF() function as an alternative.
					 
Fri Apr 04 09:30:48 2014 <tjf@aaolxp.aao.gov.au>  DramaErs version: 3.13

Fri Jan 28 09:58:04 2011 <instswtest@aaomc.aao.gov.au>  DramaErs version: 3.11

	Rename Makefile.am to GNUmakefile.am, since 2dfdr_ac is moving
	to using this name all the time.  Release Ers_Err.msg into distribution
	by specifying it in the EXTRA_DIST list.
	

Thu Sep 17 11:22:35 2009 <tjf@aaomc7.aao.GOV.AU>  DramaErs version: 3.10

Wed Jun 04 09:04:28 2008 <tjf@aaolxp.aao.gov.au>  DramaErs version: 3.7

    When doing ErsEnableTask  under VxWorks, lock the task if not in
	 interrupt context - to get the same effect.  

    Check for real interrupt context under VxWorks to ensure we don't get
	messed up by errant tasks.
