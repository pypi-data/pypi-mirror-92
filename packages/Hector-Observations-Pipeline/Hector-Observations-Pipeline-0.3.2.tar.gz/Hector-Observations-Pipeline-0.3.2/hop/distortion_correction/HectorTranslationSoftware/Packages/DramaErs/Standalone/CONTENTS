This directory contains some files needed to build ERS on a machine that does
not have the DRAMA data acquisition environment installed.

The makefile.standalone file in the main ERS directory makes use of these files.

Ers_Err.h and Ers_Err_msgt.h are normally genrated from Ers_Err.msg using the
DRAMA messgen utility. For use on systems that do not have this utility, these
versions of these files have been generated on a system that does have messgen
available. These files define values and text strings associated with the errors
generated by the arg routines.

Note that if a new error code is added to sds_err.msg or arg_err.msg, these
files will have to be generated anew, probably using messgen.
