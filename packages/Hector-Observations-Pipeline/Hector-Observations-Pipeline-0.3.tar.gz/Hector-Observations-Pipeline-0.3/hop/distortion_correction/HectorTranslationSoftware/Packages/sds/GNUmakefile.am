#
# Function:
#       Gnu automake source file for sds.
# 
# Description:
#       This file is an experimental GNU automake source for the SDS library. 
#       It is currently set up for use with 2dfdr.  
#
#       Builds the sds library and the sds_err include files.

# History:
# 	19-Aug-2009 - TJF - Original version.
#       27-Jan-2010 - TJF - Rename from Makefile.am to GNUmakefile.am.
#                           Include sdsport.h, arg.h, sdscompiler.h and 
#				sdstcl.h  in list of headers needed.
#                           Add sds_err.msg and arg_err.msg to the 
#			        distribution using EXTRA_DIST
#       02-Feb-2010 - TJF - Add sdslexer.c,sdsparser.c to list of build sources
#       08-Feb-2010 - TJF - Fix error in previous change.
#                           Add *~ files to those to be cleaned.
#       23-Dec-2015 - TJF - VPATH must be specified and include the Fortran
#                             sub-directory, so that when the top-level configure.ac
#                             specifies the subdir-objects option (to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE),
#                             which will become the default in automake, it works.
