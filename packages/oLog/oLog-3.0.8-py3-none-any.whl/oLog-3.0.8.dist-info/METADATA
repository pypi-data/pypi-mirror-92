# oLog
oLog is a log module for Python3
To use oLog, you must call the class of the log type of your choice.
## Types of logs available
* sign_color_log - log with colored sign ([!] [x] [?] [*])
* sign_log - log with sign ([!] [x] [?] [*]) not colored
* color_log - log without colored signs. The signs will be replaced by: [ERROR], [WARNING]
* simple_log - log without colorless signs. The signs will be replaced by: [ERROR], [WARNING]
## Use
Import oLog:
``` py
import olog
```
You must therefore create a journal object:
``` py
# For the newspaper with sign:
log = olog.sign_log ('Server') # Replace server with the name of your application
# For the newspaper without colored sign:
log = olog.color_log ('Server') # Replace server with the name of your application
# For the newspaper without signs:
log = olog.simple_log ('Server') # Replace server with the name of your application
```
Then, to view a log, you need to do this:
```py
log.error ('An error has occurred')
```
You can replace "error" with:
info, valid and warning

## In development
We are in the process of developing a log to file system.
