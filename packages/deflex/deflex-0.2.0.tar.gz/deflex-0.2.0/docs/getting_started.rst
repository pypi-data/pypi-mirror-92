Installation
============

On a Linux Debian system you can use the following command to solve all
requirements beforehand.

.. code-block::

    sudo apt-get install python3-dev proj-bin libproj-dev libgeos-dev python3-tk libspatialindex-dev virtualenv

If you have a working Python 3 environment, use pypi to install the latest deflex version:

::

    pip install deflex

The deflex library is designed for Python 3 and tested on Python >= 3.6. We highly recommend to use virtual environments.


Basic usage
===========

Soon.
