- Added examples to ``ia tasks`` help.

1.8.3 (2019-03-29)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Increased search timeout from 24 to 300 seconds.

1.8.1 (2018-06-28)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in ``ia tasks --get-task-log`` that was returning an unable to parse JSON error.

1.8.0 (2018-06-28)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Only use backports.csv for python2 in support of FreeBDS port.
- Added a nicer error message to ``ia search`` for authentication errors.
- Added support for using netrc files in ``ia configure``.
- Added ``--remove`` option to ``ia metadata`` for removing values from single or mutli-field metadata elements.
- Added support for appending a metadata value to an existing metadata element (as a new entry, not simply appending to a string).
- Added ``--no-change-timestamp`` flag to ``ia download``.
  Download files retain the timestamp of "now", not of the source material when this option is used.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed encoding issues that were causing some ``ia tasks`` commands to fail.
- Fixed bug where keep-old-version wasn't working in ``ia move``.

- Added support for downloading on-the-fly archive_marc.xml files.

**Bugfixes**

- Improved syntax checking in ``ia move`` and ``ia copy``.
- Added ``Connection:close`` header to all requests to force close connections after each request.
  This is a workaround for dealing with a bug on archive.org servers where the server hangs up before sending the complete response.

1.7.6 (2018-01-05)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Added ability to set the remote-name for a directory in ``ia upload`` (previously you could only do this for single files).

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in ``ia delete`` where all requests were failing due to a typo in a function arg.

1.7.5 (2017-12-07)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Turned on ``x-archive-keep-old-version`` S3 header by default for all ``ia upload``, ``ia delete``, ``ia copy``, and ``ia move`` commands.
  This means that any ``ia`` command that clobbers or deletes a command, will save a version of the file in ``<identifier>/history/files/$key.~N~``.
  This is only on by default in the CLI, and not in the Python lib.
  It can be turne off by adding ``-H x-archive-keep-old-version:0`` to any ``ia upload``, ``ia delete``, ``ia copy``, or ``ia move`` command.

1.7.4 (2017-11-06)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Increased timeout in search from 12 seconds to 24.

- Added ``--timeout`` option to ``ia search`` for setting a custom timeout.
- Loosened requirements for schema library to ``schema>=0.4.0``.

**Bugfixes**

- The scraping API has reverted to using ``items`` key rather than ``docs`` key.
  v1.7.3 will still work, but this change keeps ia consistent with the API.

1.7.3 (2017-09-20)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in search where search requests were failing with ``KeyError: 'items'``.

1.7.2 (2017-09-11)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Added support for adding custom headers to ``ia search``.

**Bugfixes**

- ``internetarchive.utils.get_s3_xml_text()`` is used to parse errors returned by S3 in XML.
  Sometimes there is no XML in the response.
  Most of the time this is due to 5xx errors.
  Either way, we want to always return the HTTPError, even if the XML parsing fails.
- Fixed a regression where ``:`` was being stripped from filenames in upload.
- Do not create a directory in ``download()`` when ``return_responses`` is ``True``.
- Fixed bug in upload where file-like objects were failing with a TypeError exception.

1.7.1 (2017-07-25)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in ``Item.upload_file()`` where ``checksum`` was being set to ``True`` if it was set to ``None``.

1.7.1 (2017-07-25)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in ``ia upload`` where all commands would fail if multiple collections were specified (e.g. -m collection:foo -m collection:bar).

1.7.0 (2017-07-25)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Loosened up ``jsonpatch`` requirements, as the metadata API now supports more recent versions of the JSON Patch standard.
- Added support for building "snap" packages (https://snapcraft.io/).

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in upload where users were unable to add their own timeout via ``request_kwargs``.
- Fixed bug where files with non-ascii filenames failed to upload on some platforms.
- Fixed bug in upload where metadata keys with an index (e.g. ``subject[0]``) would make the request fail if the key was the only indexed key provided.
- Added a default timeout to ``ArchiveSession.s3_is_overloaded()``.
  If it times out now, it returns ``True`` (as in, yes, S3 is overloaded).

1.6.0 (2017-06-27)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Added 60 second timeout to all upload requests.
- Added support for uploading empty files.
- Refactored ``Item.get_files()`` to be faster, especially for items with many files.
- Updated search to use IA-S3 keys for auth instead of cookies.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in upload where derives weren't being queued in some cases where checksum=True was set.
- Fixed bug where ``ia tasks`` and other ``Catalog`` functions were always using HTTP even when it should have been HTTPS.
- ``ia metadata`` was exiting with a non-zero status for "no changes to xml" errors.
  This now exits with 0, as nearly every time this happens it should not be considered an "error".
- Added unicode support to ``ia upload --spreadsheet`` and ``ia metadata --spreadsheet`` using the ``backports.csv`` module.
- Fixed bug in ``ia upload --spreadsheet`` where some metadata was accidentally being copied from previous rows
  (e.g. when multiple subjects were used).
- Submitter wasn't being added to ``ia tasks --json`` ouptut, it now is.
- ``row_type`` in ``ia tasks --json`` was returning integer for row-type rather than name (e.g. 'red').

1.5.0 (2017-02-17)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Added option to download() for returning a list of response objects
  rather than writing files to disk.

1.4.0 (2017-01-26)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Another bugfix for setting mtime correctly after ``fileobj`` functionality was added to ``ia download``.

1.3.0 (2017-01-26)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug where download was trying to set mtime, even when ``fileobj`` was set to ``True``
  (e.g. ``ia download <id> <file> --stdout``).

1.2.0 (2017-01-26)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Added ``ia copy`` and ``ia move`` for copying and moving files in archive.org items.
- Added support for outputing JSON in ``ia tasks``.
- Added support to ``ia download`` to write to stdout instead of file.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug in upload where AttributeError was rasied when trying to upload file-like objects without a name attribute.
- Removed identifier validation from ``ia delete``.
  If an identifier already exists, we don't need to validate it.
  This only makes things annoying if an identifier exists but fails ``internetarchive`` id validation.
- Fixed bug where error message isn't returned in ``ia upload`` if the response body is not XML.
  Ideally IA-S3 would always return XML, but that's not the case as of now.
  Try to dump the HTML in the S3 response if unable to parse XML.
- Fixed bug where ArchiveSession headers weren't being sent in prepared requests.
- Fixed bug in ``ia upload --size-hint`` where value was an integer, but requests requries it to be a string.
- Added support for downloading files to stdout in ``ia download`` and ``File.download``.

1.1.0 (2016-11-18)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Make sure collection exists when creating new item via ``ia upload``. If it doesn't, upload will fail.
- Refactored tests.

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug where the full filepath was being set as the remote filename in Windows.

- Increased maximum identifier length from 80 to 100 characters in ``ia upload``.

**Bugfixes**

- As of version 2.11.0 of the requests library, all header values must be strings (i.e. not integers).
  ``internetarchive`` now converts all header values to strings.

1.0.7 (2016-08-02)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Added ``internetarchive.api.get_user_info()``. 

1.0.6 (2016-07-14)
++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug where upload was failing on file-like objects (e.g. StringIO objects).

1.0.5 (2016-07-07)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- All metadata writes are now submitted at -5 priority by default.
  This is friendlier to the archive.org catalog, and should only be changed for one-off metadata writes.
- Expanded scope of valid identifiers in ``utils.validate_ia_identifier`` (i.e. ``ia upload``).
  Periods are now allowed.
  Periods, underscores, and dashes are not allowed as the first character.

++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Search now uses the v1 scraping API endpoint.
- Moved ``internetarchive.item.Item.upload.iter_directory()`` to ``internetarchive.utils``.
- Added support for downloading "on-the-fly" files (e.g. EPUB, MOBI, and DAISY) via ``ia download <id> --on-the-fly`` or ``item.download(on_the_fly=True)``.

**Bugfixes**

- ``s3_is_overloaded()`` now returns ``True`` if the call is unsuccessful.
- Fixed bug in upload where a derive task wasn't being queued when a directory is uploaded.

1.0.3 (2016-05-16)
++++++++++++++++++

**Features and Improvements**

- Use scrape API for getting total number of results rather than the advanced search API.
- Improved error messages for IA-S3 (upload) related errors.
- Added retry suport to delete.
- ``ia delete`` no longer exits if a single request fails when deleting multiple files, but continues onto the next file.
  If any file fails, the command will exit with a non-zero status code.
- All search requests now require authentication via IA-S3 keys.
  You can run ``ia configure`` to generate a config file that will be used to authenticate all search requests automatically. 
  For more details refer to the following links:

  http://internetarchive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html?highlight=configure#configuring

  http://internetarchive.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#configuration

- Added ability to specify your own filepath in ``ia configure`` and ``internetarchive.configure()``.

**Bugfixes**

- Updated ``requests`` lib version requirements.
  This resolves issues with sending binary strings as bodies in Python 3.
- Improved support for Windows, see `https://github.com/jjjake/internetarchive/issues/126 <https://github.com/jjjake/internetarchive/issues/126>`_ for more details.
- Previously all requests were made in HTTP for Python versions < 2.7.9 due to the issues described at `https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html <https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html>`_.
  In favor of security over convenience, all requests are now made via HTTPS regardless of Python version.
  Refer to `http://internetarchive.readthedocs.org/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#https-issues <http://internetarchive.readthedocs.org/en/latest/troubleshooting.html#https-issues>`_ if you are experiencing issues.
- Fixed bug in ``ia`` CLI where ``--insecure`` was still making HTTPS requests when it should have been making HTTP requests.
- Fixed bug in ``ia delete`` where ``--all`` option wasn't working because it was using ``item.iter_files`` instead of ``item.get_files``.
- Fixed bug in ``ia upload`` where uploading files with unicode file names were failing.
- Fixed bug in upload where filenames with ``;`` characters were being truncated.
- Fixed bug in ``internetarchive.catalog`` where TypeError was being raised in Python 3 due to mixing bytes with strings.

++++++++++++++++++

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed OverflowError bug in uploads on 32-bit systems when uploading files larger than ~2GB.
- Fixed unicode bug in upload where ``urllib.parse.quote`` is unable to parse non-encoded strings.

**Features and Improvements**

0.7.1 (2014-08-25)
++++++++++++++++++

- Added `Item.s3_is_overloaded()` method for S3 status check. This method is now used on
  retries in the upload method now as well. This will avoid uploading any data if a 503
  is expected. If a 503 is still returned, retries are attempted.
- Added `--status-check` option to `ia upload` for S3 status check.
- Added `--source` parameter to `ia list` for returning files matching IA source (i.e. 
  original, derivative, metadata, etc.).
