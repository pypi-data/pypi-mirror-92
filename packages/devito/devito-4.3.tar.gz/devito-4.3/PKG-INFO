Description: Devito is a new tool for performing
              optimised Finite Difference (FD) computation from high-level
              symbolic problem definitions. Devito performs automated code
              generation and Just-In-time (JIT) compilation based on symbolic
              equations defined in SymPy to create and execute highly
              optimised Finite Difference kernels on multiple computer
              platforms.
