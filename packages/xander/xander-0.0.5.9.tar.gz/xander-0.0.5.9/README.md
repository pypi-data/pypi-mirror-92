# Xander

Xander is my first experience in developing MLOps tools. I developed this tool one piece at time since my first day in Bip spa.
This tool represents my personal and professional growth, it contains scripts on which every Data Science project is based. Repeating them every time was frustrating so why not create a tool that did it for me?

Xander is a Greek name meaning "the one who saves".
