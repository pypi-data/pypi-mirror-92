        Tools for developing git-managed software
        
        ## Install
        These are generic installation instructions.
        
        ### To use, permanently
        The quickest way to get started is to install the current release from PyPI:
        ```
        pip3 install --user Leytonium
        ```
        
        ### To use, temporarily
        If you prefer to keep .local clean, install to a virtualenv:
        ```
        python3 -m venv venvname
        venvname/bin/pip install Leytonium
        . venvname/bin/activate
        ```
        
        ### To develop
        First clone the repo using HTTP or SSH:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/combatopera/Leytonium.git
        git clone git@github.com:combatopera/Leytonium.git
        ```
        Now use pyven's pipify to create a setup.py, which pip can then use to install the project editably:
        ```
        python3 -m venv pyvenvenv
        pyvenvenv/bin/pip install pyven
        pyvenvenv/bin/pipify Leytonium
        
        python3 -m venv venvname
        venvname/bin/pip install -e Leytonium
        . venvname/bin/activate
        ```
