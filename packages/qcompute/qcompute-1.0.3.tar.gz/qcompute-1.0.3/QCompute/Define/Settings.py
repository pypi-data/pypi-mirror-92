Configuration
"""
from QCompute.Define import MeasureFormat

outputInfo = True
"""
Output info setting.

Output the returned information from quantum-hub to console.

The information also can be found from quantum-hub website.

Values: True, False
"""

measureFormat = MeasureFormat.Bin
"""
Measure output format setting. 

Measure key is '00', '01', '10', '11' or '0x0', '0x1', '0x2', '0x3'

This format can reduce the object size of the results. The default is 'Bin'. 

Values: MeasureFormat.Bin, MeasureFormat.Hex
"""

inProcessSimulator = True
"""
Run simulator in or out process.

The 'inProcessSimulator' option can significantly accelerate the calculation of simulator while 
the outProcessSimulator can enhance the stability of simulator.  

Supporting local_baidu_sim2

Values: True, False
"""

doCompressGate = True
"""
Compress gate before simulating.

CompressGate can significantly increase the simulator calculating speed. 
It can combine the neighbour single qubit gate into the nearest two-qubits gate. 
The process can significant increase the tensor product process.   

Supporting local_baidu_sim2

Values: True, False
"""

linuxDirectSim2Thunder = False
"""
Use local sim2 thunder directly in linux.
