        Description
        ===========
        
        kilojoule is Python module/package to provide convenience functions
        for performing thermodynamic and heat transfer calculations.  The
        primary use case for these functions is in scripts written to solve 
        specific problems.  To that end, simplicity of syntax for variables
        and readability of output are prioritized over speed.  Wrapper
        functions are provided to pull thermodynamic properties from multiple 
        sources (CoolProp for real fluids and PYroMat for ideal gases) using 
        a consistent syntax regardless of the source and including units 
        (supplied by the Pint library) as an integral part of all calculations.  
        Variable names are chosen to be consistent with those commonly used in 
        the mechanical engineering texts.
