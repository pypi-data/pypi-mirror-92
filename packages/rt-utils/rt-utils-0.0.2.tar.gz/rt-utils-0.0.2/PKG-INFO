Description: # RT-Utils
        A minimal python library for the creating and manipulation of RTStructs.
        
        # Mask -> RT-Struct
        This is the main motivation of the project. Wanted to allow physicians to be able to view 
        
        # RT-Struct -> Mask
        
        # Notes
        All contours will use the same Frame of Reference UID.
        Using non CT image storage dicom files is undefined behavior.
        Will skip adding non CT images 
        Only supports 1 structured set of ROI sequence
