        This was developed by Jamie Smith. From his notes:

        > In my preliminary testing, I found that comparing the
        > average error and average y^2 values was a reasonable test
        > for how linear the data is. If the average y^2 is an order
        > of magnitude or two greater than the average error, the data
        > is more or less linear. This ratio also has the nice
        > property that if you multiply all times by a scalar, it
        > stays the same, so if the user's function gets 10x faster in
        > every case, the correlation factor doesn't change at all.
