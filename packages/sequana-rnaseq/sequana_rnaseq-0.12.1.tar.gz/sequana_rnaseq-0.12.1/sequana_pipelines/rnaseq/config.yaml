# - aligner: either star, bowtie or bowtie2. fastq_screen, if checked, uses
#        either bowtie2 by default.
# - genome_directory: directory where all indexes are written.
# - rRNA_contaminant: path to an existing fasta file for ribosomal RNA (to be found in
#   genome_directory)
# - rRNA_feature: if rRNA_contaminant is not provided, ribosomal RNA will be extract
#     from GFF using this feature name. It must be found. 
# - indexing: if indexing is set to True, the index for bowtie1 will be done as
#   well as the indexing of the aligner provided. If the files exists already, not
#   indexing is performed. If you want to force the index building despite the
#   presence of the index files, then, use the force_indexing parameter and set
#   it to True. Indexing is followed by force_indexing to make sure we do not
#   erase the index files, which may be large.

# - strandness: (optional) you should provide the strand parameters, given

#      tolerance parameter here below)
# - tolerance: if strandness is not provided, we will guess it from
#     the data. The metric used is between 0 and 1. It is a ratio between 
#     strand + and -. If below tolerance, the strand is reversely stranded. If
#     above 1-tolerance, it is (forward) stranded. If around 0.5 +- tolerance,
#     it is unstranded. Otherwise, it means our guess would not be very
#     reliable. A warning will be raised. Note also that if there is no
#     consensus across samples, a warning/error may also be raised. tolerance
#     is therefore in the range [0-0.25]
# in the options, one can use the -t option to specify the feature type in GTF
# annotation. For example gene, exon (default). The -g option specify the 
# attribute type in GTF annoation. (gene_id) by default. Finally, 
# the -s option perform strand specific read counting. 0 unstranded, 1
# stranded, 
# 2 reversely stranded.

# bamCoverage write file in bigwig format from BAM files.
# This tool takes an alignment of reads or fragments as input (BAM file) and
# generates a coverage track (bigWig or bedGraph) as output. The coverage is
# calculated as the number of reads per bin, where bins are short consecutive
# counting windows of a defined size. It is possible to extended the length of
# the reads to better reflect the actual fragment length. *bamCoverage* offers
# normalization by scaling factor, Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads
# (RPKM), and 1x depth (reads per genome coverage, RPGC).
#
# :Parameters:
#
# - do: if unchecked, this rule is ignored
# - binSize: Size of the bins, in bases, for the output of the
#            bigwig/bedgraph file. (default: 50)
# - genomeSize: Report read coverage normalized to 1x sequencing depth
#                        (also known as Reads Per Genomic Content (RPGC)).
#                        Sequencing depth is defined as: (total number of
#                        mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome
#                        size. The scaling factor used is the inverse of the
#                        sequencing depth computed for the sample to match the
#                        1x coverage. To use this option, the effective genome
#                        size has to be indicated after the option. The
#                        effective genome size is the portion of the genome
#                        that is mappable.
# - extendReads: This parameter allows the extension of reads to
#                fragment size.
# - minFragmentLength: The minimum fragment length needed for read/pair
#                      inclusion. Note that a value other than 0 will exclude
#                      all single-end reads.
# - maxFragmentLength: The maximum fragment length needed for read/pair
#                      inclusion. A value of 0 disables filtering and is
#                      needed for including single-end and orphan reads.
