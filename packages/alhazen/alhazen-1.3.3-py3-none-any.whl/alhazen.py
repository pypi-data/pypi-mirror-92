"""Alhazen is a small, simple framework to facilitate running experiments, written in
Python, using cognitive models, or similar applications, in multiple, parallel processes.
It is only useful on multi-core machines, though most modern machines are such; the more
cores, the more performance benefit you are likely to get by using it. It also depends
upon the experiment being structured as a large number of identical, independent runs of
the same activity, or of similar activities. This is a common pattern, each such run
usually corresponding to a distinct virtual participant, or possibly a collection of
interacting participants.

When an Alhazen experiment is run the initial process is used as a parent, controller
process and it spawns one or more child, worker processes to run the individual tasks.
Alhazen handles partitioning the sub-tasks between these workers, and collecting their
results, which can then be aggregated in the parent, controller process. To use Alhazen
you make a subclass of its :class:`Experiment` or :class:`IteratedExperiment` class,
override some of its methods to describe what the workers should do and what results to
return and aggregate, declare how many workers to use, and then call its :meth:`run`
method.

class Experiment:
    """An abstract base class, concrete subclasses of which define experiments that can be
    run a collection of independent tasks, possibly distributed to multiple worker
    processes when run on on a multi-core machine. A subclass of :class:`Experiment` must
    at least override the :meth:`run_participant` method; typically it will override one
    or more other methods.

    The *participants*, if supplied, it should be a positive integer, the number of
    virtual participants to run. If not supplied it defaults to 1.

    The *conditions*, if supplied, it should be an iterable of values that are both
    hashable and `picklable
    <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html#pickle-picklable>`_. These denote
    different conditions in which the task of the :class:`Experiment` should be run, and
    all *participants* are run once against each condition. Multiple, orthogonal sets of
    conditions are often most easily represented as tuples of elements of the underlying
    individual sets of conditions.

    The *process_count*, if supplied, should be a non-negative integer. If non-zero it is
    the number of worker processes to use. Note that the overall program will actually
    contain one more process than this, the control process, which is also the main
    process in which the :class:`Experiment`'s :meth:`run` method is called. If
    *process_count* is zero (the default if not supplied) it indicates that Alhazen should
    attempt to determine the number of cores available and use this number of worker
    processes. For various reasons this determination may be inaccurate, so if you know
    by other means what will work best for your experiment it may be better to supply it
    explicitly. Note also that this determination is of physical cores, ignoring any
    virtual ones supplied by `simultaneous mutlithreading
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_multithreading>`_. If such a determination
    cannot be made a default of 4 is used.

    By default when an :class:`Experiment` is running a
    `tqdm <https://tqdm.github.io/>`_ progress indicator is shown, advanced as each task
    is completed. This may be suppressed by setting *show_progress* to ``False``.

    Because participants are typically run in multiple processes, if they all want to
    write to a single log file access to that file must be synchronized. Alhazen supplies
    a mechanism to more easily facilitate this in easy cases. A file name can be supplied
    as a value of the *logfile* parameter, in which case it names a file that will be
    opened for writing when the experiment is run, and closed when it finishes. Within the
    various methods the programmer overrides that file can be accessed using the
    :attr:`log` context manager, which ensures synchronization and makes available the
    file. If no *logfile* is supplied or it is None, the context manager returns a file
    that is a sink; that is, in this case writing to this file simply discards the output.

    It is frequently useful to write log files as Comma Separated Values (CSV) files. The
    *logfile* will be wrapped with a Python :class:`csv.writer` if *csv* is not false.
    If *csv* is a string it should be a CSV dialect. If it is ``True`` the `excel` dialect
    will be used. To use a :class:`csv.DictWriter` supply the *fieldnames*. In this case
    the *restval* and *extrasaction* parameters can be used to pass these extra parameters
    to the :class:`csv.DictWriter`.
