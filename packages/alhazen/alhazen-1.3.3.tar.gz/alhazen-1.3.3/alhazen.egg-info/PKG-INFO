Description: Alhazen is a small, simple framework to facilitate running
        experiments, written in Python, using cognitive models, or similar
        applications, in multiple, parallel processes. It is only useful on
        multi-core machines, though most modern machines are such; the more
        cores, the more performance benefit you are likely to get by using it.
        It also depends upon the experiment being structured as a large number
        of identical, independent runs of the same activity, or of similar
        activities. This is a common pattern, each such run usually
        corresponding to a distinct virtual participant, or possibly a
        collection of interacting participants.
        
        There is [online documentation of Alhazen](https://halle.psy.cmu.edu/alhazen/),
        and the [sources](https://bitbucket.org/dfmorrison/alhazen/) are on Bitbucket.
        
        
        Alhazen requires Python version 3.7 or later. Recent versions of Mac OS X and recent Linux distributions
        are likely to have a suitable version of Python pre-installed, but it may need to be invoked as ``python3``
        instead of just ``python``, which latter often runs a 2.x version of Python instead. Use of a virtual environment,
        which is recommended, often obviates the need for the ``python3``/``python`` distinction.
        If it is not already installed, Python, for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, or other Unices, can be
        `downloaded from python.org <http://www.python.org/download/>`_, for free.
        
        Normally, assuming you are connected to the internet, to install Alhazen you should simply have to type at the command line
        
            pip install alhazen
        
        Depending upon various possible variations in how Python and your machine are configured
        you may have to modify the above in various ways
        
        * you may need to ensure your virtual environment is activated
        
        * you may need use an alternative scheme your Python IDE supports
        
        * you may need to call it ``pip3`` instead of simply ``pip``
        
        * you may need to precede the call to ``pip`` by ``sudo``
        
        * you may need to use some combination of the above
        
        If you are unable to install Alhazen as above, you can instead
        `download a tarball <https://bitbucket.org/dfmorrison/alhazen/downloads/?tab=tags>`_.
        The tarball will have a filename something like alhazen-1.3.3.tar.gz.
        Assuming this file is at ``/some/directory/alhazen-1.3.3.tar.gz`` install it by typing at the command line
        
            pip install /some/directory/alhazen-1.3.3.tar.gz
        
        Alternatively you can untar the tarball with
        
            tar -xf /some/directory/alhazen-1.3.3.tar.gz
        
        and then change to the resulting directory and type
        
            python setup.py install
