Is your windows machine too sleepy? Use `wek` to temporarily prevent it from fading away!

1. Install wek: `pip install wek`
2. Press WinKey+R, type wek and run. A popup window will show up, and as long as this window is not closed, your machine won't go to sleep.

`wek` asks your system to stay awake by calling a windows API function. Wek's main function, `wek()`, consists of just three lines of code.
