When printing a report I get an ods file instead of pdf
=======================================================

When a report is generated the server application first creates an ods file.

If 
:doc:`extension </refs/client/report/at_extension>`
attribute of the report is set to 'pdf' or any other format except 'ods', the
application first creates an ods file and then uses LibreOffice
in "headless" mode to convert the ods file to that format.

If LibreOffice is currently running on the server this conversion
may not happen. You must close LibreOffice on the server for 
the conversion to take place.
