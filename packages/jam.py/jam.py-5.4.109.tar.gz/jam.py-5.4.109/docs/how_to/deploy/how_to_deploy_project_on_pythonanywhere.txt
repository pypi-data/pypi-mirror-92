How to deploy project on PythonAnywhere
=======================================

* Use pip to install Jam.py. To do this, open the bash console and run the 
  following command (for Python 3.7):

  .. code-block:: console
  
    pip3.7 install --user jam.py
  
* Create a zip archive of your project folder, upload the archive in the **Files** 
  tab and unzip it.
  
  We assume that you are registered as *username* and your project is now located 
  in the */home/username/project_folder* directory.

* Open the **Web** Tab. Add a new web app. In the Code section specify

  * Source code: */home/username/project_folder*

  * Working directory: */home/username/project_folder*

  In the WSGI configuration file:/var/www/username_pythonanywhere_com_wsgi.py file
  add the following code

  .. code-block:: py

    import os
    import sys
    
    path = '/home/username/project_folder'
    if path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(path)
    
    from jam.wsgi import create_application
    application = create_application(path)

* Reload the server.
