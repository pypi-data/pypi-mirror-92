.. py:attribute:: log_changes

**domain**: server

**language**: python

**class** :doc:`Item class </refs/server/item_api>`

Description
===========

Indicates whether to log data changes.

Use ``log_changes`` to control whether or not changes made to the data in an 
item dataset are recorded. When ``log_changes`` is ``true`` (the default), all 
changes are recorded. They can later be applied to an application server by 
calling the 
:doc:`apply <m_apply>`
method. When ``log_changes`` is ``false``, data changes are not recorded and cannot 
be applied to an application server.
