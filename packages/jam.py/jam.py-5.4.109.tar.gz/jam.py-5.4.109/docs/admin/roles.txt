Select Roles node in the project tree to create and modify roles that defined
users privileges. Each user must be assigned to one of roles defined in the 
project. A role defines the user's rights to view, create, modify, and delete 
data. 

To add or delete a role, use New and Delete buttons. To set permissions 
for a role, select the role in a role list and put or remove a check mark next 
to the appropriate column by clicking on it with the mouse: View, Create, Edit, 
Delete (allowed to view, create, modify and delete, respectively).
