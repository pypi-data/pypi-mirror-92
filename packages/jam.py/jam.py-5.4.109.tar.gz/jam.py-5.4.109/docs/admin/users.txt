Users
=====

If the **Safe mode** checkbox in the 
:doc:`project parameters <project/parameters>`
is checked, authentication 
is needed for a user to work in the system.

But before that, the user must be registered in the framework. To register a user 
select Users node, click New and fill in the form that appears:

	:align: center
	:alt: New users dialog


* **Name** – user name
* **Login** - login
* **Password** - password
* **Role** – user role
* **Information** - some additional information
* **Admin** - if this flag is set, the user has the right to work in the Application builder.
