Common fields
=============

Items that have access to the database data can have common fields. They are 
defined in the group they belong to:

Here two fields are defined: **id** and **deleted**. 

The **id** field is set as a primary key and will store a unique identifier 
for each record in the database table. This value is automatically generated by 
the framework when inserting a new record into the table.

The **deleted** field is set as a deletion flag. When the 'Soft delete' 
check-box is checked in the 
:doc:`Item Editor Dialog </admin/items/item_editor_dialog>`, 
the delete method does not erase a record physically from the table, but uses 
this field to mark the record as deleted. The open method takes this into 
account when an SQL query is generated to get records from the database table. 

For detail groups two more fields could be defined â€” **master_id** and 
**master_rec_id**. They are used to link detail records to the a record in 
master table, see :doc:`Details <details>`.
