Report templates
================

To create a report, you must first prepare a report template in LibreOffice Calc. 

The template files are located in the report folder of the project directory. 

The following figure shows a template of the Invoice report.

Reports in Jam.py are band-oriented. 

Each report template is divided into bands. To set bands use the leftmost column 
of a template spreadsheet. 

In the Invoice report template there are three bands: **title**, **detail** and 
**summary**. 

In addition, templates can have programmable cells. 

For example, in the template of Invoice report the I7 cell contains the text 
%(date)s. 

Programmable cell begins with **%**, then follows the name of the cell in 
the parenthesis which is followed by character **s**.
