Install python
==============

Jam.py requires python. If it is not installed you can get the latest 
version of Python at https://www.python.org/download/ 

You can use the following versions of Python with Jam.py:

Python 2

* Python 2.7

Python 3

* Python 3.4
* Python 3.5
* Python 3.6

You can verify that Python is installed by typing python from your shell; 
you should see something like::

    Python 2.7.12 (default, Nov 19 2016, 06:48:10) 
    [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux2
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> 
    
If Python 2 and Python 3 are installed try to type python3::

    Python 3.5.2 (default, Nov 17 2016, 17:05:23) 
    [GCC 5.4.0 20160609] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>     

Install Jam.py
====================

Installing an official release with `pip`
-----------------------------------------

This is the recommended way to install Jam.py.

1. Install pip_. The easiest is to use the `standalone pip installer`_. If your
   distribution already has ``pip`` installed, you might need to update it if
   it's outdated. (If it's outdated, you'll know because installation won't
   work.)

2. If you're using Linux, Mac OS X or some other flavor of Unix, enter the
   command 
   
   .. code-block:: console
   
    sudo pip install jam.py 
    
   at the shell prompt. 
   
   If you're using Windows, start a command shell with administrator privileges 
   and run the command 
   
   .. code-block:: console
   
    pip install jam.py 
   
   This will install Jam.py in your Python installation's ``site-packages`` directory.


.. _pip: http://www.pip-installer.org/
.. _standalone pip installer: http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip


Installing an official release manually
---------------------------------------

1. Download the package archive. 

2. Create a new directory and unpack the archive there. 

3. Go into the directory and run the setup command from command line

.. code-block:: console

   $ python setup.py install
    
This will install Jam.py in your Python installationâ€™s site-packages directory.

.. note::
	on some unix like systems you may need to switch to root or run: 
	sudo python setup.py install
