==================
Creating a project
==================

Create a new directory. 

Go into the directory and run from command line:

.. code-block:: console

    $ jam-project.py


The following files and folders will be created in the directory::

    /
        css/
        js/
        img/
        reports/
        static/
        admin.sqlite
        server.py
        index.html
        wsgi.py


To start Jam.py web server run **server.py** script.


.. code-block:: console

    $ ./server.py


.. note::
    You can specify a port as parameter, for example 
    
    .. code-block:: console
    
        $ ./server.py 8081. 
        
    By default, the port is 8080. If you will specify another port, you need to 
    use it in a browser in the next steps.


Open a Web browser and go to “/builder.html” on your local domain – e.g., 
http://127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html. You should see the select language dialog. 


.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080/builder.html
    
    
In the dialog that will appear, select the language and press OK button.

In the New project dialog box fill in:

* **Caption** - the project name that appears to users
* **Name** - name of project (task) that will be used in programming code to 
  get access to the task object. Should be a short valid python identifier.
  This name is used as a prefix when creating a table in the project database.
* **DB type** — select database type. If database is not Sqlite, it must be 
  created in advance and its attributes should be entered in the 
  corresponding form fields. 
  To see examples of Database setup, follow the :doc:`link </admin/project/database>`.

When you press OK, the connection to the database will be checked, and in case 
of failure 	an error message will be displayed.

.. note::

    Please note the following requirements:
    
    * to use **FireBird** database, the python ``fdb`` library must be installed 
    * **PostgreSQL** requires ``psycopg2`` library 
    * **MySQL** requires ``MySQLdb`` library
    * **Oracle** requires ``cx_Oracle`` library     
    * **MSSQL** requires ``pymssql`` library
    * to generate reports **LibreOffice** must be installed
    
.. note::

    For **SQLite** database, when an item field is deleted or renamed, or foreign 
    key is created, 
    :doc:`Application builder </admin/index>`,
    creates a new table and copies records from the old one into it.
    
    For **SQLite** database, Jam.py doesn’t support importing of metadata into an 
    existing project (project with tables in the database). 
    You can only import metadata into a new project.

If all goes well, a new project will be created and the project tree will appear 
in the Application builder.

Now, to see the project itself, create a new page in the browser and type in the 
address bar:

.. code-block:: console

    127.0.0.1:8080
