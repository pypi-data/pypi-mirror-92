Customizing Forms
=================

When we refresh the project page we'll see that fields  in the table and 
in the edit form of the "Contacts" journal are displayed in the order in which 
they were created.

To change how fields are displayed in the table, click the **View Form** 
button to open the
:doc:`View Form Dialog </admin/items/view_form_dialog>`
Let's change the displayed fields using **left**, **right**, **up** 
and **down** buttons

Let's click on the button right to the **Sort fields** input and select the 
fields by which user can sort the contents of the table by clicking in the 
corresponding column header of the table.
