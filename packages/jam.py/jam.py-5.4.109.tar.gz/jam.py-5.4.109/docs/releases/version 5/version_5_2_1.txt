=============
Version 5.2.1
=============

Library:

* DBtable class declared jam.js reworked. Paginator div is removed from table and 
  doesn't scroll when table is scrolled. For tables with pagination y scrolling is 
  removed. You can pass 
  :doc:`create_table </refs/client/item/m_create_table>` method two new options:
  
  * summary_fields - a list of field names. When it is specified and item 
    paginate attribute is true, the table calculates sums for numeric fields and 
    displays them in the table footer, for not numeric fields it displays the 
    number of records.
  * freeze_count - an integer value. If it is greater than 0, it specifies 
    number of first columns that become frozen - they will not scroll when the table
    is scrolled.  
 
* Bug when inserting a new record and pressing Escape key doesn't cancel operation
  fixed
  
* Bug when history doesn't save user name fixed

Demo project:

* Code that calculated summary for table in invoices client module removed
* Code of on_view_form_created event handler in the task client module of 
  demo application and new project is changed so after deleting a record the 
  :doc:`refresh_page </refs/client/item/m_refresh_page>`
  method is called
