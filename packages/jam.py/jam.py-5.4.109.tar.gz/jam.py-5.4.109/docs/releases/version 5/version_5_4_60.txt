* Synchronization of parameters and reloading of the task tree when metadata changes 
  for web applications running on parallel processes reworked. 

* Import of metadata reworked. See 
  :doc:`Export/import metadata </admin/project/metadata_file>`

* Created the ability to import metadata from the migration folder when the server 
  is restarted. See
  :doc:`How to migrate development to production </how_to/how_to_migrate_development_to_production>`

* Migration to another database is available now. See
  :doc:`How to migrate to another database </how_to/how_to_migrate_to_another_database>`

* virtual_table is now a read-only property on the client
  :doc:`virtual_table </refs/client/item/at_virtual_table>`
  and server
  :doc:`virtual_table </refs/server/item/at_virtual_table>`.
  For an item which virtual_table property is true, calling the open method creates 
  an empty data set, and calling the apply method does nothing.
  
* When importing a table the virtual_table attribute id read only now.

* title_line_count option is added to the 
  :doc:`table_options </refs/client/item/at_table_options>`

  the height of the row is determined by the contents of the title cells 
  It can be set in Application Builder.
