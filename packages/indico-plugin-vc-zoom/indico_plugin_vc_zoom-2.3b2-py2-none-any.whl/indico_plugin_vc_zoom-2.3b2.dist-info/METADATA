# Indico Plugin for Zoom

## Features

 * Creating Zoom meetings from Indico;
 * Sharing Zoom meetings between more than one Indico event;
 * Creating meetings on behalf of others;
 * Changes of host possible after creation;
 * Protection of Zoom link (only logged in, everyone or no one)
 * Webinar mode;

## Changelog

### 2.3b2

- Improve logging when a Zoom API request fails
- Fail more gracefully if no Zoom account could be found for a user
- Allow using the same name for multiple Zoom rooms
- Update the join url when changing the passcode
- Provide an alternative method of looking up the Zoom user corresponding to an Indico user
- Always show the full join link and passcode to event managers
- The meeting passcode can be restricted to registered participants
- Show "Make me host" button in the management area and in contributions/sessions as well
- Warn the user if they delete a Zoom meeting linked to multiple events if they aren't the host
- Change Zoom meeting to "recurring meeting" when cloning an event
- Show detailed error when deleting a meeting fails
- Do not allow passcodes that are too long for zoom
- Remove the "Assistant Zoom ID" logic due to problems with Zoom's API rate limits (all meetings created were counted against the assistant's rate limit instead of the host's); this means the host can no longer be changed, but Indico instead provides an option to event managers to make themselves a co-host.
- Fix an error when changing the linked object of a recurring Zoom room in Indico
- Include Zoom join links in the event's ical export (note: only Zoom meetings with a public passcode are displayed unless you have at least Indico v2.3.3)
- Skip deleted Zoom meetings when cloning events
- Mark Zoom meetings as deleted when receiving the corresponding webhook event
- Add missing admin-level settings for VC managers, creation ACL and notification email addresses

**Breaking change:** The email domains are now stored as a list of strings instead of a comma-separated list. You need to update them in the plugin settings.

### 2.3b1

- Initial beta release

## Zoom App Configuration
