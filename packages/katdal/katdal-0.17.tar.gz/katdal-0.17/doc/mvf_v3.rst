MVF version 3 (early MeerKAT)
=============================

The version 3 format is an evolution of the v2 format, and continues to
use HDF5 as the underlying format. It was used for early engineering and
commissioning of MeerKAT, but replaced by v4 before science operations
started.

At present there is no detailed documentation.
