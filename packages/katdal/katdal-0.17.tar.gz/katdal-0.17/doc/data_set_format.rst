Data set format reference
=========================

In most cases uses should not need to know the details of the data set formats,
because katdal exists to hide these details and present a consistent,
user-friendly view. It also contains workarounds for known issues in older data
sets (which are not documented here). This is reference documentation useful to
katdal developers and to power users who need to extract information not
presented by the katdal interface.
