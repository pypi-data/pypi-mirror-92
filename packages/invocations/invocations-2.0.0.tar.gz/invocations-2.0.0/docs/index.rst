Roadmap
=======

While Invocations has been released with a major version number to signal
adherence to semantic versioning, it's somewhat early in development and has
not fully achieved its design vision yet.

We expect it to gain maturity in tandem with the adoption and development of
Invoke post-1.x. It's also highly likely that Invocations will see a few major
releases as its API (and those of its sister library, `patchwork
<https://fabric-patchwork.readthedocs.io>`_) matures.
