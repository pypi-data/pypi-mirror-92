    Vendorize Python package ``distribution`` at version/SHA ``version``.

    Specify the vendor folder (e.g. ``<mypackage>/vendor``) as ``vendor_dir``.

    For Crate/PyPI releases, ``package`` should be the name of the software
    entry on those sites, and ``version`` should be a specific version number.
    E.g. ``vendorize('lexicon', '0.1.2')``.

    For Git releases, ``package`` should be the name of the package folder
    within the checkout that needs to be vendorized and ``version`` should be a
    Git identifier (branch, tag, SHA etc.) ``git_url`` must also be given,
    something suitable for ``git clone <git_url>``.

    For SVN releases: xxx.

    For packages where the distribution name is not the same as the package
    directory name, give ``package='name'``.

    By default, no explicit license seeking is done -- we assume the license
    info is in file headers or otherwise within the Python package vendorized.
    This is not always true; specify ``license=/path/to/license/file`` to
    trigger copying of a license into the vendored folder from the
    checkout/download (relative to its root.)
