dispy is a framework for parallel execution of computations by
distributing them across multiple processors on a single machine,
among many machines in a cluster, grid or cloud. The computations can
be standalone programs or python functions. dispy is implemented with
asynchronous sockets and tasks (without threads) using polling
mechanisms epoll, kqueue and poll, and Windows I/O Completion Ports
(IOCP) for high performance and scalability.

Files in 'py2' directory are to be used with Python 2.7+ and
files in 'py3' directory are to be used with Python 3.1+.

dispy package is available in Python Package Index (PyPI), so it
can be installed easily for Python 2.7+ with the command:

    pypi install dispy

or for Python 3.1+ with the command:

    pypi3 install dispy
