### What is Bluebelt?
Bluebelt is a collection of python tools that can be used in Six Sigma projects. The package is far from complete but it is in active development. Some tools on my wish list are:

#### Measurement System Analysis
  - ICC Kappa
  - ICC Kappa with know standard
  - Attribute Gauge Study
  - Type 1 Gauge Study
  - Linearity & Bias Study
  - Nested Gauge R&R
  - Crossed Gauge R&R

#### Process Performance
  - Descriptive Statistics
  - Probability Plot
  - Control Chart
  - Run Chart
  - Process Capability Analysis

#### Analysis Tooling
  - Box Plot
  - Interval Plot
  - Scatter Plot
  - Linear Regression
  - Chi Square Test
  - Variance Plot
  - ANOVA
  - Kruskal-Wallis
  - Residual Plot
  - Two Sample T-Test
  - Mann - Whitney Test

Besides these analysis I would really like some qualitative tooling as well. I am thinking of things like a graphic representation of the stakeholder analysis.

So... a lot of work to do.

### How does it work?
The package is highly dependent on Pandas. There a two ways to use the functions available.
