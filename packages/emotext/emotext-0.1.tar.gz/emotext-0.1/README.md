| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| positive_words.txt | put all the positive words on this file it can be in any language. in this documentation i use indonesian language,so the positive words like example : optimis, kuat, menyenangkan and etc |
| negative_words.txt | all the negative words, example : mengganggu, menindas, kejam and etc |
| stop_words.txt | all the stop words, example : yang, di, dan itu, etc |

###### *note
all of those file wrote in indonesian language, it possible to change with any language. just put all of the word into .txt file and make sure 1 line for 1 word, look at example below :

```python
# do
optimis
kuat
menyenangkan

# don't
optimis kuat menyenangkan
```

If you are indonesian i have created all of those file just look at folder **data**

### warning
You don't have to worry about noise on your text like

- omoji : ðŸ¥¸ ðŸ˜˜ ðŸ¤¬
- punctuation : #?!^&*%@, etc

all of that will be removed automatically and if you grab the data from **twitter** it automatically remove username and hastag
