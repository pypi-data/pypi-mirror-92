Please [contact us](mailto:support@4dnucleome.org) to get access to the system, or if you have any questions or suggestions.  Detailed documentation on data submission can be found [at this link](https://data.4dnucleome.org/help/submitter-guide/getting-started-with-submissions)\n\n## Installing the package\n\n```\npip install submit4dn\n```\n\nTo upgrade to the latest version\n\n```\npip install submit4dn --upgrade\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nThis package may install and run on Python v2.7 but using this package with that version is no longer officially supported and your mileage may vary.\n\nIt is recommended to install this package in a virtual environment to avoid dependency clashes.\n\nProblems have been reported on recent MacOS X versions having to do with the inablity to find `libmagic`,\na C library to check file types that is used by the `python-magic` library.\n\neg. `ImportError: failed to find libmagic.  Check your installation`\n\nFirst thing to try is:\n\n```\npip uninstall python-magic\npip install python-magic\n```\n\nIf that doesn\'t work one solution that has worked for some from [here](https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert/issues/1927):\n\n```\npip uninstall python-magic\npip install python-magic-bin==0.4.14\n```\n\nOthers have had success using homebrew to install `libmagic`:\n\n```\nbrew install libmagic\nbrew link libmagic  (if the link is already created is going to fail, don\'t worry about that)\n```\n\n## Connecting to the Data Portal\nTo be able to use the provided tools, you need to generate an AccessKey on the [data portal](https://data.4dnucleome.org/).\nIf you do not yet have access, please contact [4DN Data Wranglers](mailto:support@4dnucleome.org)\nto get an account and [learn how to generate and save a key](https://data.4dnucleome.org/help/submitter-guide/getting-started-with-submissions#getting-connection-keys-for-the-4dn-dcic-servers).\n\n## Generating data submission forms\nTo create the data submission xls forms, you can use `get_field_info`.\n\nIt will accept the following parameters:\n~~~~\n    --type           use for each sheet that you want to add to the excel workbook\n    --descriptions   adds the descriptions in the second line (by default True)\n    --enums          adds the enum options in the third line (by default True)\n    --comments       adds the comments together with enums (by default False)\n    --writexls       creates the xls file (by default True)\n    --outfile        change the default file name "fields.xls" to a specified one\n    --order          create an ordered and filtered version of the excel (by default True)\n~~~~\n\nExamples generating a single sheet:\n~~~~\nget_field_info --type Biosample\nget_field_info --type Biosample --comments\nget_field_info --type Biosample --comments --outfile biosample.xls\n~~~~\n\nExample Workbook with all sheets:\n~~~~\nget_field_info --type all --outfile MetadataSheets.xls\n~~~~\n\nExamples for Workbooks using a preset option:\n~~~~\nget_field_info --type HiC --comments --outfile exp_hic_generic.xls\nget_field_info --type ChIP-seq --comments --outfile exp_chipseq_generic.xls\nget_field_info --type FISH --comments --outfile exp_fish_generic.xls\n~~~~\n\nCurrent presets include: `Hi-C, ChIP-seq, Repli-seq, ATAC-seq, DamID, ChIA-PET, Capture-C, FISH, SPT`\n\n## Data submission\n\nPlease refer to the [submission guidelines](https://data.4dnucleome.org/help/submitter-guide) and become familiar with the metadata structure prior to submission.\n\nAfter you fill out the data submission forms, you can use `import_data` to submit the metadata. The method can be used both to create new metadata items and to patch fields of existing items.\n~~~~\n\timport_data filename.xls\n~~~~\n\n#### Uploading vs Patching\n\nRunnning `import_data` without one of the flags described below will perform a dry run submission that will include several validation checks.\nIt is strongly recommended to do a dry run prior to actual submission and if necessary work with a Data Wrangler to correct any errors.\n\nIf there are uuid, alias, @id, or accession fields in the xls form that match existing entries in the database, you will be asked if you want to PATCH each object.\nYou can use the `--patchall` flag, if you want to patch ALL objects in your document and ignore that message.\n\nIf no object identifiers are found in the document, you need to use `--update` for POSTing to occur.\n\n**Other Helpful Advanced parameters**\n\nNormally you are asked to verify the **Lab** and **Award** that you are submitting for.  In some cases it may be desirable to skip this prompt so a submission\ncan be run by a scheduler or in the background:\n\n`--remote` is an option that will skip any prompt before submission\n\n**However** if you submit for more than one Lab or there is more than one Award associated with your lab you will need to specify these values\nas parameters using `--lab` and/or `--award` followed by the uuids for the appropriate items.\n\n<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlN5Y28D9MzzcRy/giphy.gif" width="200" height="200" />\n\n\n# Development\nNote if you are attempting to run the scripts in the wranglertools directory without installing the package then in order to get the correct sys.path you need to run the scripts from the parent directory using the following command format:\n\n```\n  python -m wranglertools.get_field_info â€”-type Biosource\n\tpython -m wranglertools.import_data filename.xls\n```\n\npypi page is - https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Submit4DN\n\n\nThe proper way to create a new release is `invoke deploy` which will prompt\nyou to update the release number, then tag the code with that version number\nand push it to github, which will trigger travis to build and test and if\ntests pass it will deploy to production version of pypi. Note that travis will\nautomatically deploy the new version if you push a tag to git.\n\n# Pytest\nEvery function is tested by pytest implementation. It can be run in terminal in submit4dn folder by:\n\n    py.test\n\nSome tests need internet access, and labeled with "webtest" mark.\n\nSome tests have file operations, and labeled with "file_operation" mark.\n\nTo run the mark tests, or exclude them from the tests you can use the following commands:\n\n    # Run all tests\n    py.test\n\n    # Run only webtest\n    py.test -m webtest\n\n    # Run only tests with file_operation\n    py.test -m file_operation\n\nFor a better testing experienece that also check to ensure sufficient coverage and runs linters use invoke:\n\n```\n   invoke test\n```\n\nThis will first run linters, if linters pass, tests will be run and if tests achieve specified minimum coverage (89% as of time of writting) pass the tests.\n',
