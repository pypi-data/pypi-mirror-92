How can TESPy contribute to your energy system calculations?
============================================================

In this part you learn how you can use TESPy for your energy system
calculations: In energy system calculations, for instance in oemof-solph,
plants are usually modelled as abstract components on a much lower level of
detail. In order to represent a plant within an abstract component it is
possible to supply characteristics establishing a connection between your
energy system model and a specific plant model. Thus the characteristics are a
representation of a specific plant layout in terms of topology and process
parameters. In the examples section we have an example of a heat pump COP at
different loads and ambient temperatures as well as a CHP unit with
backpressure turbine operating at different loads and varying feed flow
temperatures of a heating system.
