Description: 
        # pysecs
        
        pysecs is an open source library for calculating Spherical Elementary Current Systems (SECS).
        
        ## Features
        
        - Based upon the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) framework with `fit()` and `predict()` methods.
        - The only dependency is [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/). It is built using fast broadcasting techniques to provide highly scalable calculations.
        
        ## Examples
        
        Examples can be found in [examples/](./examples/)
        
        ## Install
        
        The easiest method to install pysecs is with pip.
        
        ```bash
        > pip install pysecs
        ```
        
        For a source install you can follow these instructions:
        
        1. Clone the git repository
        
            ```bash
            > git clone https://github.com/greglucas/pysecs
            ```
        
        2. Build and install the package
        
            ```bash
            > python setup.py install
            ```
        
        3. Testing
        The package has a test suite that can be run with pytest
        
            ```python
            > pytest
            ```
