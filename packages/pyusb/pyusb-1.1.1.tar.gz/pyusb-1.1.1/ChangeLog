    libusb1: discard partial prototypes if previous load failed
    
    If loading libusb1 failed, perhaps due to a missing symbol, a second
    call to libusb1.get_backend would reuse partially constructed prototypes
    and return an unsound _LibUSB instance.[1]
    
    To fix this, remove the previous optimization and load/setup the library
    every time.
