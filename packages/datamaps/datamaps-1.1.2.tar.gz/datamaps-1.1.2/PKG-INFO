Description: ![Tests](https://github.com/hammerheadlemon/datamaps/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)
        
        This software is a CLI UI layer for
        [bcompiler-engine](https://github.com/hammerheadlemon/bcompiler-engine).  It
        allows for easy access to adapters available within `bcompiler-engine` and is
        intended to be packaged using a packaging application such as `PyInstaller` and
        thus making `bcompiler-engine` palatable to non-technical users, and users who
        do not have access to a Python installation.
