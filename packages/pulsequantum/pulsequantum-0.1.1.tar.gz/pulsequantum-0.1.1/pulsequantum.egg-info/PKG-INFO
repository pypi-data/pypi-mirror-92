        ## Running the tests
        
        If you have gotten `pulsequantum` from source, you may run the tests locally.
        
        Install `pulsequantum` along with its test dependencies into your virtual environment by executing the following in the root folder
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install .
        $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Then run `pytest` in the `tests` folder.
        
        ## Building the documentation
        
        If you have gotten `pulsequantum` from source, you may build the docs locally.
        
        Install `pulsequantum` along with its documentation dependencies into your virtual environment by executing the following in the root folder
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install .
        $ pip install -r docs_requirements.txt
        ```
        
        You also need to install `pandoc`. If you are using `conda`, that can be achieved by
        
        ```bash
        $ conda install pandoc
        ```
        else, see [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) for pandoc's installation instructions.
        
        Then run `make html` in the `docs` folder. The next time you build the documentation, remember to run `make clean` before you run `make html`.
