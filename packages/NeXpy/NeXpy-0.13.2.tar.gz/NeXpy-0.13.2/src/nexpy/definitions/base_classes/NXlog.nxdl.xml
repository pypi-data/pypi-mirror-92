    <doc>
        Definition of information that is recorded against time, 
        such as information monitored during the run. 
        It contains
        the logged values and the times at which they were measured as elapsed time since a starting
        time recorded in ISO8601 format. This method of storing logged data helps to distinguish
        instances in which a variable is a dimension scale of the data, in which case it is stored
        in an ``NXdata`` group, and instances in which it is logged during the 
        run, when it should be stored in an ``NXlog`` group.
        Note: When using multiple ``NXlog`` groups, it is suggested to place 
        them inside a ``NXcollection`` group.  In such cases, when
        ``NXlog`` is used in another class,
        ``NXcollection/NXlog``  is then constructed.
