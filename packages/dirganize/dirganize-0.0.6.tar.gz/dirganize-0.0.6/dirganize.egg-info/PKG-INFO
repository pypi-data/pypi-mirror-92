Description: # dirganize
        
        A command-line tool to organize files into category directories.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```shell
        pip install dirganize
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Move into your desired directory and run `dirganize`.
        
        It will put all files into their respective category folders, based on the default configuration.
        
        You can put a `.dirganize.yml` file ( inside the folder you want to dirganize ) to override the default configuration.
