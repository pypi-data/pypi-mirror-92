ABCpy is a scientific library written in Python for Bayesian uncertainty quantification in
absence of likelihood function, which parallelizes existing approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) 
algorithms and other likelihood-free inference schemes. It presently includes:

* RejectionABC
* PMCABC (Population Monte Carlo ABC)
* SMCABC (Sequential Monte Carlo ABC) 
* RSMCABC (Replenishment SMC-ABC)
* APMCABC (Adaptive Population Monte Carlo ABC)
* SABC (Simulated Annealing ABC)
* ABCsubsim (ABC using subset simulation)
* PMC (Population Monte Carlo) using approximations of likelihood functions
* Random Forest Model Selection Scheme
* Semi-automatic summary selection (with Neural networks)
* summary selection using distance learning (with Neural networks)

ABCpy addresses the needs of domain scientists and data
scientists by providing

* a fully modularized framework that is easy to use and easy to extend, 
* a quick way to integrate your generative model into the framework (from C++, R etc.) and
* a non-intrusive, user-friendly way to parallelize inference computations (for your laptop to clusters, supercomputers and AWS)
* an intuitive way to perform inference on hierarchical models or more generally on Bayesian networks

# Documentation
For more information, check out the

* [Documentation](http://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.1) 
* [Examples](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy/tree/v0.6.1/examples) directory and
* [Reference](http://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/v0.6.1/abcpy.html)


Further, we provide a
[collection of models](https://github.com/eth-cscs/abcpy-models) for which ABCpy
has been applied successfully. This is a good place to look at more complicated inference setups.

# Quick installation and requirements


ABCpy can be installed from `pip`: 

    pip install abcpy

Check [here](https://abcpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more details.

Basic requirements are listed in `requirements.txt`. That also includes packages required for MPI parallelization there, which is very often used. However, we also provide support for parallelization with Apache Spark (see below).
 
 Additional packages are required for additional features: 

- `torch` is needed in order to use neural networks to learn summary statistics. It can be installed by running `pip install -r requirements/neural_networks_requirements.txt`
- In order to use Apache Spark for parallelization, `findspark` and `pyspark` are required; install them by `pip install -r requirements/backend-spark.txt`  

## Troubleshooting `mpi4py` installation

`mpi4py` requires a working MPI implementation to be installed; check the [official docs]((https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)) for more info. On Ubuntu, that can be installed with:

    sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev

Even when that is present, running `pip install mpi4py` can sometimes lead to errors. In fact, as specified in the [official docs]((https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)), the `mpicc` compiler needs to be in the search path. If that is not the case, a workaround is: 

    env MPICC=/path/to/mpicc pip install mpi4py

In some cases, even the above may not be enough. A possibility is using `conda` (`conda install mpi4py`) which usually handles package dependencies better than `pip`. Alternatively, you can try by installing directly `mpi4py` from the package manager; in Ubuntu, you can do:

    sudo apt install python3-mpi4py 

which however does not work with virtual environments.
