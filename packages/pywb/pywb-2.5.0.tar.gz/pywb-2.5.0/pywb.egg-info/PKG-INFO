        Web Archiving Tools for All
        ---------------------------
        
        `View the full pywb documentation <https://pywb.readthedocs.org>`_
        
        **pywb** is a Python (2 and 3) web archiving toolkit for replaying web archives large and small as accurately as possible.
        The toolkit now also includes new features for creating high-fidelity web archives.
        
        This toolset forms the foundation of Webrecorder project, but also provides a generic web archiving toolkit
        that is used by other web archives, including the traditional "Wayback Machine" functionality.
        
        
        New Features
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        The 2.x release included a major overhaul of pywb and introduces many new features, including the following:
        
        * Dynamic multi-collection configuration system with no-restart updates.
        
        * New recording capability to create new web archives from the live web or other archives.
        
        * Componentized architecture with standalone Warcserver, Recorder and Rewriter components.
        
        * Support for Memento API aggregation and fallback chains for querying multiple remote and local archival sources.
        
        * HTTP/S Proxy Mode with customizable certificate authority for proxy mode recording and replay.
        
        * Flexible rewriting system with pluggable rewriters for different content-types.
        
        * Standalone, modular `client-side rewriting system (wombat.js) <https://github.com/webrecorder/wombat>`_ to handle most modern web sites.
        
        * Improved 'calendar' query UI with incremental loading, grouping results by year and month, and updated replay banner.
        
        * New in 2.4: Extensible UI customizations system for modifying all aspects of the UI.
        
        * New in 2.4: Robust access control system for blocking or excluding URLs, by prefix or by exact match.
        
        
        Please see the `full documentation <https://pywb.readthedocs.org>`_ for more detailed info on all these features.
