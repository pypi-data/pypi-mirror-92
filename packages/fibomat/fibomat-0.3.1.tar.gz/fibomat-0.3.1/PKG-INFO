        fib-o-mat is a Python library to create beam patterns for focused ion beam instruments.
        
        Pattern geometries can be modeled directly in Python bsaed on (pre-)defined geometric primitives or importet from vector
        graphics. These can be equipped with beam and rasterizing settings and exported to microscope compatible files.
        
        fib-o-mat is by designed flexible and easily expandable. Hence, adding support for for different microscopes, custom
        geometric primitives or optimization routines is a straightforward process.
        
        For the usage of fib-o-mat, basic python knowledge and a good understanding of the target microscope are mandatory.
        See the [getting started guide](https://fib-o-mat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) for an introduction to
        this library and the [user guide](https://fib-o-mat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_guide.html) for a complete
        documentation. The module reference is to be found [here](https://fib-o-mat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html).

        Installation
        ============
        Run in a terminal
        ```
        $ pip install fibomat
        ```  
        It is highly recommended to use virtual environments.
        
        Example
        =======
        ```python
        from fibomat import Sample, Mill, Q_, U_
        from fibomat.shapes import Line
        from fibomat import raster_styles
        from fibomat.default_backends import SpotListBackend
        
        # create a Sample class object with optional description
        sample = Sample('Useful description here')
        
        # add a site to the sample with cente = (0, 0) and field of view of (10, 10)
        site = sample.create_site(dim_position=([0, 0], U_('µm')), dim_fov=([10, 10], U_('µm')))  # '%*µm*)'
        
        # create a Pattern with a Line shape and add it to the site
        site.create_pattern(
            dim_shape=(Line((-5, 0), (5, 0)), U_('µm')),
            shape_mill=Mill(dwell_time=Q_('5 ms'), repeats=1),
            raster_style=raster_styles.one_d.Linear(pitch=Q_('1 nm'))
        )
        
        # export a rasterized version of the pattern as text file in a pre-defined (but editable) format. See docs for details.
        sample.export(SpotListBackend).save('pattern.txt')
        
        # plot the pattern
        sample.plot()
        ```
