Description: ===========
        ``FlowCal``
        ===========
        ``FlowCal`` is a library for processing and analyzing flow cytometry data in Python.
        It features:
        
        * Extraction of Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files into numpy array-like structures
        * Traditional and non-standard gating, including automatic density-based two-dimensional gating.
        * Traditional transformation functions, such as exponentiation.
        * Analysis of calibration beads data, standard curve generation, and transformation to absolute units (Molecules of Equivalent Fluorophore, MEF).
        * Plotting, including generation of histograms, density plots and scatter plots.
        * A user-fiendly Excel UI to gate, transform, plot, and generate statistics from a list of flow cytometry samples in a simple fashion.
