Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        To make a long story short: sometimes you need to break into the debugger in the
        middle of a Script (Python). To prevent the frustrating ``Unauthorized: import
        of 'pdb' is unauthorized`` message, use this enablesettrace package.
        
        This package supports importing the ``pdb`` *and* ``ipdb`` module. It is a fork
        of the `Products.enablesettrace
        <https://pypi.org/project/Products.enablesettrace>`_ package.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The installation is as simple as making sure the package is located on the
        Python path. For example when you are using zc.buildout list
        ``Products.Ienablesettrace`` in the ``eggs`` section::
        
          [buildout]
          ...
          eggs =
              ...
              Products.Ienablesettrace
