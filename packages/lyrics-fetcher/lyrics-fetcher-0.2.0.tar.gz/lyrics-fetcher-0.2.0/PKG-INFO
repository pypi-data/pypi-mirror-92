Description: # fetch_lyrics CLI Function
        
        Custom command-line interface, based on the [lyricgenius](https://pypi.org/project/lyricsgenius/)\* Genius API implementation. Command line flags can be used to automatically copy the found lyrics to the MacOS\* clipboard, and to store the found lyrics as .txt files in a (configurable) directory.

        ## Installation and First Use
        
        ```python
        pip install lyrics-fetcher
        ```
        
        For this software to work, a Genius API token is required. These (free) tokens can be found on [the Genius developers website](https://genius.com/developers). More information about the Genius API can be found in [the Genius API documentation](https://docs.genius.com). See the Usage section for information on how to set a token.

        ## Usage
        
        ### Fetching Lyrics
        
        ```python
        fetch_lyrics -[pc] "Queen" "Bohemian Rhapsody"
        ```
        
        the `-p` flag enables saving of lyrics to a .txt file. By default, this is the current directory from which the command is run. To change the output directory, see the changing settings section.
        
        the `-c` flag enables copying of the found lyrics to the MacOS\* clipboard. This could be useful for manually adding lyrics to ID3 tags.
        
        `--settings`, `--help` and `--version` can also be called for their basic functionality.
        
        ### Changing Settings
        
        before the first use, the token should be set. This token will be locally stored (unencrypted). To set the token, use the following command:
        
        ``` python
        fetch_lyrics set token "TOKEN"
        ```
        
        where TOKEN is replaced with the token obtained from the Genius developers webpage.
        
        A custom output directory for the output of found lyrics into .txt files can be set using:
        
        ```python
        fetch_lyrics set outdir "desired/output/directory"
        ```
        
        Settings are locally stored in .settings files. Note that these are unencrypted, but are never shared or moved.
