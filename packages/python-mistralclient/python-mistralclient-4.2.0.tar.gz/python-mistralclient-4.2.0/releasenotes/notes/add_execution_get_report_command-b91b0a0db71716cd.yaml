    Added the new CLI command "execution-get-report" that prints information
    about the entire workflow execution tree, including its task executions,
    action executions and nested workflow executions. The command currently
    has filters "--errors-only" that allows to find only ERROR paths of the
    execution tree (enabled by default), "--no-errors-only" that allows to
    print all tree regardless of the elements' state, "--max-depth" that
    allows to limit the depth of the tree that needs to be printed.
    This command should be especially useful for debugging failure situations
    when it's not easy to manually track down to the root cause.
