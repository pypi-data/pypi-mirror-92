    The default behavior of the action-execution-list, execution-list and
    task-list commands has been changed.  Instead of returning the oldest
    N records (default 100 or --limit specified value) by default,
    they now return the most recent N records, when no other sort_dir,
    sort_key or marker values are provided.  If the user specifies --oldest
    or any of the --marker, --sort_key or --sort_dir options, the new
    behavior is disabled and the commands will work according to the
    user-supplied options.
