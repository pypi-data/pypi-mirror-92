    Using namespaces is now supported from the client. It is possible to use
    the namespace flag with all workflows commands and when creating a workflow
    execution. Namespace feature allows a user to add two workflows with the
    same name to Mistral as long as they are within two different namespaces.
    Namespace will also be visible in the table printed when using the CLI to
    get info about workflows. Plus, the CLI will print the workflow namespace
    along with the workflow name where needed.
