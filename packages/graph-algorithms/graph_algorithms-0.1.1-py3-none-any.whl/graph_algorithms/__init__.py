"""Common Graph Algorithms Library

Library of graph algorithms which operate directly on python data structures.

This library uses many callback functions.  In this module's documentation 
callbacks are written in the following way:
    callback-name(argument-list) -> return-type


Callback Time Complexity:
All time complexities stated in this module assume that user supplied callback 
functions execute in a constant amount of time.


This module is safe for:

Small optimizations are pointless in python.
Focus on asyptotic time complexity and simplifying things for the user.

        WARNING:graph_algorithms:Detected inconsistent heuristic

        WARNING:graph_algorithms:Detected inadmissible heuristic
            Note only vertexes on the final path are checked for inadmissible
            heuristics.


    Explanation of A* (pronounced "A star") algorithm:
    Every vertex "n" has a value f(n):
        f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
            where: g(n) is the cost of reaching the vertex from the start
                   h(n) is the estimated cost of reaching the goal from this vertex
    f(n) represents the estimated total cost of reaching the goal through this vertex.

    A* works by repeatedly exploring the vertex with the lowest f(n) value.

    The heuristic h(n) should be admissible (never overestimate the true cost).
    If the heuristic overestimates the cost then A* will ignore potentially optimal paths.
    Overestimating cost by amount D will yield a path that is at most D units longer
    than the shortest/optimal path.  If the heuristic underestimates the cost then A* 
    will explore unfruitful paths which will cause it to take longer and use more memory.

    The heuristic should be consistent A.K.A. monotonic:
        h(n) <= c(n, n') + h(n')                    Triangle inequality
        where: n and n' are vertexes
               n is the parent of n'
               c(n, n') is the cost of traversing the edge from n to n'
    If the heuristic is consistent then f(n) is non-decreasing as A* moves down any path.
    Proof by induction:
        h(n) <= c(n, n') + h(n')                    Criterial for consistency
        g(n) + h(n) <= g(n) + c(n, n') + h(n')      Add the cost of reaching n to both sides
        g(n) + h(n) <= g(n') + h(n')                g(x) is total cost of the path to x
        f(n) <= f(n')
    A consequence of non-decreasing paths is if A* explores a vertex then it has found
    the shortest path to that vertex.

    All consistent heuristics are admissible. Not all admissible heuristics are consistent.

    The effective branching factor is the number of adjacent vertexes that are explored 
    on average.  The more accurate the heuristic is the more vertexes will be
    ruled out of the search resulting in a lower effective branching factor.


    Search Properties:
    Complete: Yes, if there is a solution A* will find it.
    Optimal: Yes, if the heuristic is consistent A* will find the shortest path.
