=================================
Review Board 3.0.20 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: January 20, 2021


Packaging
=========

Added restrictive version ranges for many of our dependencies, in order to
avoid installation issues on Python 2.7:

* :pypi:`cryptography` is capped to < 3.4.
* :pypi:`dnspython` is capped to < 2.0.
* :pypi:`feedparser` is capped to < 6.0.
* :pypi:`Pillow` is capped to < 7.0.
* :pypi:`python-dateutil` is capped < 2.0.
* :pypi:`rbintegrations` is capped to < 3.0.


Performance Improvements
========================

* Made some improvements to the main queries for review requests to simplify
  query complexity and better utilize database-level query caching.

  This should improve things for large databases. Please let us know if you
  see any issues. If this has sped things up for you, we'd love to hear that,
  too!


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed a long-standing display issue with the :guilabel:`Reviews` and
  :guilabel:`Diffs` tabs on Firefox.

  These tabs had a thin line separating the tabs from the rest of the
  review request, which wasn't present on other browsers.
