Review Board 2.5.13 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: June 13, 2017


Security Updates
================

This release addresses a vulnerability found in-house that affects standalone
Review Board servers where a URL could be crafted that would display portions
of a diff that has been commented on from another review request, even from
those posted to invite-only groups, private repositories, or other
:term:`Local Sites` that the user otherwise doesn't have access to.

If you're not making use of these access controls, this bug won't impact you,
but for those that do, we recommend upgrading to stay secure.


Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
----------------------------------

Security vulnerabilities can be reported by `filing a bug`_ and choosing
:guilabel:`Security issue` or by e-mailing security@beanbaginc.com. Patches
can be sent by posting a review request to https://reviews.reviewboard.org and
choosing *only* the "security" review group. These methods ensure security
vulnerabilities are sent safely and confidentially to the Review Board team.

New Features
============

* WebHook URLs can now contain inline credentials.

  This allows WebHooks to be used with password-protected endpoints using
  HTTP Basic Auth.

* Added Python version and install path information to :command:`rb-site
  --version` and the Version Mismatch error page.

  This information, along with some helpful resolution steps in the Version
  Mismatch page, should help users who have ended up in a broken state after
  an upgrade. Version mismatches are often caused by running two different
  versions of Python or having an older version of a package taking precedence
  due to its installation method. It's now easier to determine the cause and
  to fix the problem.
