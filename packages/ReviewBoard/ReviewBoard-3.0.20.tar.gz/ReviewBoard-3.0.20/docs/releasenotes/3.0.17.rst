Review Board 3.0.17 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: February 11, 2020


Compatibility Changes
=====================

* Updated GitHub API usage to use modern authentication and avoid deprecation
  warning e-mails.

  We've long relied on the original methods for passing authentication
  credentials to GitHub's API. These were recently deprecated, and as of this
  week GitHub has been e-mailing information about this deprecation to people
  whose accounts are linked for repositories.

  This release employs the modern method, avoiding the e-emails. Future
  changes will build upon this to begin adjusting to more of GitHub's modern
  authentication requirements.

* Removed Google Code and Fedora Hosted from the repository configuration
  page.

  These services haven't been around for a while, but we've continued to
  list them for compatibility reasons. This release finally removes them
  from the list of available hosting services.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Fixed some behind-the-scenes bugs with the repository configuration page.
