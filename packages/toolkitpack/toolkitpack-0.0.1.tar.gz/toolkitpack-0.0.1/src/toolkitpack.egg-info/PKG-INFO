Description: # toolkit-pack
        
        This is an example project demonstrating how to publish a python module to PyPI
        
        ## Installation
        
        Run the following to install:
        
        ```python
        pip install toolkitpack
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        from toolkitpack import add
        
        # Add two numbers
        a = 5
        b = 5
        add(a, b)
        ```
        
        ## Steps to make your own
        
        [This guy taught me](https://youtu.be/GIF3LaRqgXo)
        
        - Add your python code to src folder, the directory should look something like this
        
          ![a](assets\tree.png)
        
        - Create a setup.py file in the same location as src folder
        
          - Add necessary configurations in setup.py, like
        
          ```python
          # Don't use distutils, setup comes with Python in setuptools
            from setuptools import setup
        
            setup(
            name='toolkitpack',
            version='0.0.1',
            description='Random operations who cares',
            py_modules=['tookitFile', 'additionalFiles'],
            package_dir={'': 'src'},
          )
        
          ```
        
        - Let's create a wheel file (format in which we upload to PyPi)
        
          ```bash
        
          python setup.py bdist_wheel
          ```
        
          Don't be alarmed as this command will generate a lot of additional files
        
        - Install package locally using Pip
        
          ```bash
          pip install -e .
          ```
