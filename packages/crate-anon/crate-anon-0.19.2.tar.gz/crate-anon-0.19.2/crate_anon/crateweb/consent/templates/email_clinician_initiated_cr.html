    <p>Dear {{ patient_lookup.clinician_salutation }},</p>

    <p>According to our records you have requested that one of your patients be
       included in a study.</p>

    {% include "patient_table.html" with patient_lookup=patient_lookup consent_mode=consent_mode verbose=True %}

           Should we not include patient table for security reasons? - Clinician
           could mistype email address

    <p>The study is:</p>

            information pack as you have requested that the

    {% else %}
