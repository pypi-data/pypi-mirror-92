    <p>Dear {{ patient_lookup.clinician_salutation }},</p>

    <p>Based on anonymised information in the CPFT Research Database, a
    research team has identified the following patient of yours as
    potentially eligible for a study that they are conducting:</p>

    {% include "patient_table.html" with patient_lookup=patient_lookup consent_mode=consent_mode verbose=True %}

    <p>The study is:</p>

    {% include 'study_table.html' with study=study contact_request=contact_request to_clinician=True offer_details=True offer_clinician_form=True %}

    <p>At this stage, the researchers do not know the patient’s identity.
    They have identified the patient based on a search of the anonymised
    CPFT Research Database. Patient information may only be disclosed to
    the researchers with the patient’s consent.</p>

    {% if clinician_involvement_requested %}

        <b>The researchers have indicated that they would like you, as the
        patient’s clinician, to consider this request.</b>
        This may be because they would need clinical information from you
        to establish whether the patient is indeed eligible to participate,
        or because they would need information from you as part of the
        study itself.

    {% elif clinician_involvement_required_yellow %}

        The researchers would like the patient’s permission to be
        contacted.
        <b>This patient has actively chosen that all approaches by research
        teams should be on a case-by-case
        basis via the primary clinical team</b> (“approach mode YELLOW”),
        and so this request has been passed along to you.

    {% elif clinician_involvement_required_unknown %}

        The researchers would like the patient’s permission to be
        contacted.
        <b>This patient has never been asked their preference regarding
        direct approaches by research teams,</b>
        and so this request has been passed along to you.
        <b>We would like to know the patient’s preference about being
        contacted for this study,
        but also about future studies in general.</b>

                    <p>Normally, the decision about being contacted for
                    research studies should be the patient’s. However, all
                    approaches such as this one, via the clinical team, are
                    subject to your “veto”: as the patient’s clinician, you
                    may decline to pass the request on to the patient. If
                    you choose this option, no information about the
                    patient will be given to the research team. Please only
                    choose this option in exceptional circumstances, as it
                    reduces the patient’s ability to choose. Exceptional
                    circumstances might include those in which, in your
                    judgement, an offer to the patient to participate in
                    research might cause extreme distress, or that the
                    patient currently lacks the capacity to make a decision
                    about participation (and the study does not concern
                    such patients specifically). Your views on the study
                    itself should not prompt you to select this option; all
                    studies supported by CPFT have ethical approval and we
                    seek to promote patient choice about research
                    participation. Please give a reason for your choice,
