        <li>This query builder parses the SQL you start with, and then
            adds more pieces. It is less powerful than arbitrary SQL.</li>

        <li>
            Things that are are better done with raw SQL include:
            <ul>
                <li>Combining expressions with OR, or in complex ways.</li>
                <li>Restricting to a set of values with IN.</li>
                <li>Finding information about patients P that “have” something
                    (e.g. a diagnosis) using EXISTS.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>If you use a file (for IN or NOT IN clauses), this file should be
            in ASCII or UTF-8 format, with one value per line. Lines will
            be stripped of whitespace (left + right). Lines starting with
            a # character will be treated as comments and ignored.</li>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This query builder <b>only looks at tables that contain patient
            information</b> (as judged by the presence of the field used
            to auto-join tables, as defined by your database manager).
            It ignores “system” tables with no connection to a patient.
            If you want to explore all the tables, explore the database
            structure using the options on the
            <a href="{% url 'home' %}">Main menu</a>, and use the
            <a href="{% url 'query' %}">SQL view</a> to create a more complex
            query.</li>

        <li>The query builder will automatically JOIN tables based on a shared
            field (i.e. records for the same patient).
            This field is typically the “transient research ID” (TRID).
            The TRID is a numerical value that identifies a patient.
            It’s quicker for queries than the “research ID” (RID), but the RID
            will stay constant if/when the research database is rebuilt, and
            the TRID might change, so you should make a note of the RID if you
            want to save data.
            The RID is typically an encrypted patient identifier from the
            source database; the TRID is taken from a one-time pad.</li>

        <li>The query builder will also automatically join tables across
            schemas/databases. If the administrator has said that patient
            tables in the databases use a common research ID (RID), that field
            will be used. [Example: both databases use the same patient
            numbers, and they have been hashed in the same way.]
            Otherwise, if they both have tables containing a master research
            ID (MRID), that is used to bridge the databases.
            [Example: two databases use different patient numbers, but they
            both contain a table with a hashed UK NHS number.]</li>

        <li><b>NOTE, though, that JOINs are many-to-many unless otherwise
            restricted.</b> So if a patient has 10 values for C-reactive
            protein, and 20 progress notes mentioning depression, a simple
            JOIN will give 10 * 20 = 200 rows. You can easily create very
            large queries by accident. If you want to do something more
            sophisticated, like “show me the progress notes THAT mention
            depression for patients WHO HAVE a CRP of >20 at some point”,
            you want a query more like “SELECT rid, progress_note FROM
            my_progress_note_table
            WHERE CONTAINS(progress_note, 'depression') AND rid IN
            (SELECT DISTINCT rid FROM my_crp_table WHERE crp > 20)”.
            Use the SQL editor to create such queries.</li>

    </ul>
