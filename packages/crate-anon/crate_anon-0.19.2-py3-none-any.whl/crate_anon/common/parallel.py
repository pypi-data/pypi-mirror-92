    Returns:

    Algorithm:

    - We convert some non-integer thing into a deterministic but roughly
      randomly distributed integer using :func:`hash64`. That produces a signed
      integer, which is OK because ``%`` works nonetheless.

    When we use it:

    - We use this function to parallelize for non-integer PKs.

    - This is less efficient than dividing the work up via SQL, because we have
      to fetch/hash something.

    - Perform this test ASAP in loops, for speed.
