    <p>Cambridgeshire & Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) is involved in
        health research for the benefit of patients. We’d like to know your
        view on being contacted about research studies that may be relevant to
        you, and being invited to take part.</p>

        your permission.</p>

    <p><b>If our researchers wish to write to you about relevant research
        projects, which of these three options would you prefer?</b>
        Please tick one.</p>
