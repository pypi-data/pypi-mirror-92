    <p>We would like to tell you about some of the ways that
    Cambridgeshire &amp; Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT) is
    involved in health research. We’d like to know whether you’d like
    to be contacted in the future about research studies that may be
    relevant to you.</p>

    <p>I enclose:</p>
    <ul>
        <!--
        <li>a leaflet explaining how health information is used in
        research in the UK (<i>“Your health records save
        lives”</i>),</li>
        -->

        <li>a leaflet explaining how you can take part in research at
        CPFT if you want to (<i>“Taking part in research”</i>),</li>

        <li>a form for you to fill in (<i>“Would you like to be
        contacted about research?”</i>),</li>

        <li>and a Freepost envelope to return the form (to
        {{ settings.RDBM_ADDRESS|join:", " }}).</li>
    </ul>

    {% include "phrase_never_affect_personal.html" %}

    <p><b>We would be very grateful if you would fill in the form and
    send it back to us in the Freepost envelope,</b> or give it to a
    member of staff at CPFT. If you have questions you want answered
    first, please ask your CPFT health care professional.</p>

    <p>We have your details as follows. Please tell us if any of these
    details are wrong.</p>

    {% include "patient_table.html" with patient_lookup=patient_lookup %}

    <p>Thank you very much.</p>
