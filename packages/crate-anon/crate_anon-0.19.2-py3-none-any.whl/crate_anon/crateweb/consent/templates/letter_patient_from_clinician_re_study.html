        <em>I’m writing to tell you about about a research study being carried
        out within CPFT, to see whether you’d like to find out more, and maybe
        take part.</em>

            I’m contacting you because you previously chose to receive

    <p>
        Research into mental health problems is vital if we are to find better
        treatments and ways of improving the lives of those affected. CPFT and
        its partner research organizations, such as the University of
        Cambridge, conduct research into brain function and mental health
        problems that is some of the best in the world. We’d be extremely
        grateful for any help you could give us by taking part in research.
    </p>

    <p><em>The study we want to tell you about is this one:</em></p>

    {% include "study_table.html" with study=study include_summary=True only %}

    <p>
        <em>This may be a study that you could take part in. The researchers
        don’t know who you are, and we won’t tell them without your
        permission.</em>
        Receiving this invitation doesn’t necessarily mean that you have a
        particular problem or symptom — our researchers study people with
        symptoms now, but also people who’ve had a particular symptom in the
        past, and people who’ve never had a particular symptom (for comparison
        to other people who have).
    </p>

    <p>Here’s what I’ve enclosed to help you decide if you’d like to be
    contacted by the researchers with a view to possibly taking part in the
    study:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Details of the study for you to have a look at.</li>

        <li>A form to decide whether you’re interested in being
        contacted by
        {% if unknown_consent_mode %}
            the researchers about <b>this</b> study,
        {% else %}
            these researchers
        {% endif %}
        and willing to allow them
        to see your CPFT records so they can check you’re suitable for
        the study. (<b>Saying “yes” doesn’t mean that you’re agreeing
        to take part in the study</b> — just that the researchers can
        write to tell you more about the study and maybe invite you to
        take part. If you say no now, they’ll get no information about
        you, not even your name.)</li>

        {% if extra_form %}
            <li>A form from the researchers, which I’ve filled in. If you
            are interested in taking part, please fill in any gaps and
            return it. If you don’t want to take part, you can throw it
            away.</li>
        {% endif %}

        {% if unknown_consent_mode %}
            <li>
                A form titled <i>“Would you like to be contacted about
                research?”</i>.
                In the future, if researchers outside your clinical team want
                to contact you directly about research studies that may be
                relevant to you, you can choose to have your name and address
                passed on to them (GREEN), to have all requests sent to you via
                your clinicians (YELLOW), or not to have your name and address
                passed on at all (RED).
            </li>
        {% endif %}

        <li>A leaflet, <i>“Taking part in research”</i>, with some more
        general information.</li>

        <li>A Freepost envelope (to
        {{ settings.RDBM_ADDRESS|join:", " }}).</li>
    </ul>

    {% if unknown_consent_mode %}
        <p><em>The most important thing to know is that saying yes or no
        won’t affect your normal NHS treatment!</em></p>
    {% endif %}

    <p><em>
        <b>
            Please have a look at the study details,
            {% if extra_form %}
                and the form that the researchers would like,
            {% endif %}
            and then choose option 1 or option 2 on the decision form.
            {% if unknown_consent_mode %}
                Then please complete the other form (<i>“Would you like to be
                contacted about research?”</i>).
            {% endif %}
        </b>
        Finally, please return the
        form{% if extra_form or unknown_consent_mode %}s{% endif %}
        in the Freepost envelope, or give
        {% if extra_form or unknown_consent_mode %}them{% else %}it{% endif %}
        to a member of staff at CPFT.

    {% if yellow or unknown_consent_mode %}
        <p>
        {% if yellow %}
            I’ve written to you because you previously chose the “YELLOW”
            option in CPFT’s Research Database. If you’d like to be
            reminded what this means, to choose a different option, have any
            concerns, or want to discuss things further before deciding, then
            please contact us.
        {% elif unknown_consent_mode %}
            If you have any concerns, or want to discuss things further before
            deciding, then please contact us.
        {% endif %}
        You can also do so via the CPFT Research Database Manager,
        whose contact details are on the decision form
        and below.
