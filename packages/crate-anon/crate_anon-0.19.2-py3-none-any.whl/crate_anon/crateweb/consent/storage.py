    Subclasses :class:`django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage` to improve
    URL processing, as below.

    *Notes:*

    In order to use :func:`reverse`, ``config/urls.py`` can't import views that
    import models that use this... so use string, not actual Python object,
    references for ``urls.py``.

    However, in ``urls.py``, we also need things like ``mgr_admin_site.urls``,
    and ``consent/admin.py`` also imports ``models`` (which imports
    ``storage``). Problem. Specifically, a problem for making the URLs
    non-absolute for non-root hosting.

    So we use :func:`get_script_prefix` instead?

    - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/urlresolvers/

    But that isn't set at the time this is loaded, so that's no good either.
    The only other way to handle this would be to override the view form,
    or offer the private storage via Apache (but the latter would prevent
    proper security, so that's a no-no).

    Therefore, let's subclass
    :class:`django.core.files.storage.FileSystemStorage`, so we can make the
    change at runtime.
