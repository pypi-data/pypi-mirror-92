        taky - A simple COT server for ATAK
        
        ## Features (and anti-Features!)
        
         * Should support multiple ATAK clients simultaneously! You can see them on the
           map!
         * GeoChats are routed to appropriate groups / UIDs, unless broadcast!
         * SSL support with optional client keys!
         * Some design consideration for XML security!
         * Actually somewhat decent CoT routing uses Marti for other items. If
           unspecified, packets are considered broadcast.
         * A hacked up XML parser written by someone who barely understands XML!
         * Advanced Pythonic implementation of CoT model, with only 5 hours of combined
           industry experience in implementing CoT technology!
         * Server shuts down with only one Ctrl+C!
         * Thread safety? Why would you need thread safety?
        
        ## Requirements
        
         * Python 3.7 or greater
         * lxml
         * dateutil
        
        This application was developed with Python 3.8, and tested with ATAK v4.2.0.4.
        It is slowly progressing towards a beta state, and should work for playing
        around.
        
        But, really. Using this is for anything important is probably a very-bad-idea (TM).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Inside the taky folder, run
        
        ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/tkuester/taky
        $ cd taky
        $ python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can use pip!
        
        ```bash
        $ python3 -m pip install taky
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```bash
        $ taky -h
        usage: taky [-h] [-l {debug,info,warning,error,critical}] [-n IP] [-p PORT] [--ssl-cert SSL_CERT]
                    [--ssl-key SSL_KEY] [--cacert CA_CERT] [--no-verify-client] [--version]
        
        Start the taky server
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -l {debug,info,warning,error,critical}
                                Specify log level
          -n IP, --ip IP        IP Address to listen on (v4 or v6)
          -p PORT, --port PORT  Port to listen on
          --ssl-cert SSL_CERT   Path to the server certificate
          --ssl-key SSL_KEY     Path to the server certificate key
          --cacert CA_CERT      Path to the CA for verifying client certs
          --no-verify-client    Do not verify client certificates
          --version             show program's version number and exit
        
        # Run taky on :::8087
        $ taky
        
        # Run taky on 127.0.0.1:58087 with debugging enabled
        $ taky --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 58087 -l debug
        
        # Run taky within the folder (ie: if you can't install it)
        ~/taky $ python3 -m taky
        
        # Run taky with SSL and client certificates on 8089 (default)
        $ taky --ssl-cert ./server.crt --ssl-key ./server.key --cacert ./ca.crt
        ```
