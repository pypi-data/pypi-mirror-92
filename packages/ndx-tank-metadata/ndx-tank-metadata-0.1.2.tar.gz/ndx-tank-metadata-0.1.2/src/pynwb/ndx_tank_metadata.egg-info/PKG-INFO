        $ pip install ndx-tank-metadata
        ```
        
        # Usage
        This extension is built for extending the LabMetaData schema with custom fields
        requested for the conversion of Virmen metadata. Therefore, this extension is built into the
        Tank lab conversion pipeline ([tank-lab-to-nwb](https://github.com/catalystneuro/tank-lab-to-nwb))
        and is not necessary to be installed separately.
