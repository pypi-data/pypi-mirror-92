Scaruffi
========

Get some data from scaruffi.com from Python.

Piero Scaruffi has written a lot about rock music, jazz, classical, whether it
is reviews or history. It is a valuable ressource for a variety of reasons and
this script aims to make data fetching easier for personal usage.

Features:

- Get a big list of musicians.
- Get best albums per decade, grouped by rating.

This is a work in progress, I would like to add more content to be usable!



Install
-------

This library is available on PyPI:

```bash
pip install scaruffi
