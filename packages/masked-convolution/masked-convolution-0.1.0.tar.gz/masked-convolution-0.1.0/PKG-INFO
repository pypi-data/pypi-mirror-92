Description: # Masked Convolution
        
        A PyTorch implementation of a thin wrapper for masked convolutions.
        
        ## What are masked convolutions?
        
        Similarly to [partial convolutions](https://github.com/NVIDIA/partialconv), masked convolutions mask a part of the kernel, essentially ignoring data at specific locations. For an example, consider
        
        ```python
        a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        ```
        
        assuming we have a convolution kernel
        
        ```python
        kernel = [1, 1, 1]
        ```
        
        convolving over `a` would give us
        
        ```python
        a_conv = [6, 9, 12]
        ```
        
        However, if we were to mask the convolution kernel with a mask
        
        ```python
        mask = [1, 0, 1]
        ```
        
        **masked convolving** over `a` would return
        
        ```python
        a_masked_conv = [4, 6, 8]
        ```
        
        One use of masked convolutions is emulating skip-grams.
