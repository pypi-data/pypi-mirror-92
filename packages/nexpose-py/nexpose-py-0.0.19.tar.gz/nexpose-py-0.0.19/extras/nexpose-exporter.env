# nsc-exporter supports the following options:
#  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
#  -u USER, --user USER  User for authentication to Nexpose. Default is to pull from environmental variable NEXPOSE_USER. If that variable is not set, prompt.
#  -p PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
#                        Password for authentication to Nexpose. Default is to pull from environmental variable NEXPOSE_PASS. If that variable is not set, prompt.
#  -i BASEURL, --baseurl BASEURL
#                        Base url of Nexpose API. Default: https://localhost
#  -P PORT, --port PORT  Port the Nexpose API runs on. Default is 3780
#  -k, --insecure        Allow operation to proceed even if connection is insecure. Do not use this in production.
#  -e EXPORT_DIR, --export-directory EXPORT_DIR
#                        Directory to export metrics to. Default is /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector. Be sure this process has write access to the directory, and that the reading
#                        process can read the file and list the directory.
#  -s, --single-pass     Perform a single pass collecting data and exit, instead of repeating forever.
