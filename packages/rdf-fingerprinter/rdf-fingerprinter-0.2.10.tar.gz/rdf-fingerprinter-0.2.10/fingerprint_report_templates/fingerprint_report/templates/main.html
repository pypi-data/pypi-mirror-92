    <h1>Class application profiles</h1>
    <section>
        <p>This section attempts at reconstructing the profiled shapes for each class. The profile is deduced based
            on structural patterns for a selected class and their descriptive statistics aggregated by distinct
            properties.
        <p>
            The structural pattern is a triple pattern of the type <em>(subject,predicate,object)</em>, which selects
            subjects that are instances of a given class and on that collection of individuals identifies all unique
            predicates used, then for each of those predicate identifies the type of the values used with it (i.e.
            either the class or the data type). The pattern can be summarised as this: <em>(ClassOfSubjects,
            distinctPredicate, ClassOfObject)</em>.

            The descriptive statistics account for (a) the number of unique subjects, (b) the number of unique objects
            (c) number of total occurrences of the pattern (d) minimal, (e) maximal and (f) average number of
            occurences.
