        asdicts: Missed utilities for working with Python dictionaries
        ===============================================================
        
        
        
        
        Missed utilities for working with Python dictionaries.
        
        Python has great builtins for working with lists as well as dictionaries, but
        some utilities for working with dictionaries are still missed. This fills the
        gap.
