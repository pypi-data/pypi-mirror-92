# aiolifx

aiolifx is a Python 3/asyncio library to control Lifx LED lightbulbs over your LAN.

[![PyPI version fury.io](https://badge.fury.io/py/aiolifx.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aiolifx)
[![MIT license](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://lbesson.mit-licen)
[![GITHUB-BADGE](https://github.com/frawau/aiolifx/workflows/black/badge.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Most of it was taken from Meghan Clarkk lifxlan package (https://github.com/mclarkk)
and adapted to Python 3 (and asyncio obviously)

# Installation

We are on PyPi so

     pip3 install aiolifx
or
     python3 -m pip install aiolifx

After installation, the utility

    aiolifx

can be used to test/control devices.

NOTE: When installing with Python 3.4, the installation produce an error message
      (syntax error). This can be safely ignored.


# How to use

Essentially, you create an object with at least 2 methods:

    - register
    - unregister

You then start the LifxDiscovery task in asyncio. It will register any new light it finds.
All the method communicating with the bulb can be passed a callback function to react to
the bulb response. The callback should take 2 parameters:

    - a light object
    - the response message


The easiest way is to look at the file in the examples directory. "Wifi" and "Uptime" use
a callback to print the info when it is returned.


In essence, the test program is this

    class bulbs():
    """ A simple class with a register and unregister methods
    """
        def __init__(self):
            self.bulbs=[]

        def register(self,bulb):
            self.bulbs.append(bulb)

        def unregister(self,bulb):
            idx=0
            for x in list([ y.mac_addr for y in self.bulbs]):
                if x == bulb.mac_addr:
                    del(self.bulbs[idx])
                    break
                idx+=1

    def readin():
    """Reading from stdin and displaying menu"""

        selection = sys.stdin.readline().strip("\n")
        DoSomething()

    MyBulbs = bulbs()
    loop = aio.get_event_loop()
    discovery = alix.LifxDiscovery(loop, MyBulbs)
    try:
        loop.add_reader(sys.stdin, readin)
        discovery.start()
        loop.run_forever()
    except:
        pass
    finally:
        discovery.cleanup()
        loop.remove_reader(sys.stdin)
        loop.close()


Other things worth noting:

    -  Whilst LifxDiscovery uses UDP broadcast, the bulbs are
       connected with Unicast UDP

    - The socket connecting to a bulb is not closed unless the bulb is deemed to have
      gone the way of the Dodo. I've been using that for days with no problem

    - You can select to used IPv6 connection to the bulbs by passing an
      IPv6 prefix to LifxDiscovery. It's only been tried with /64 prefix.
      If you want to use a /48 prefix, add ":" (colon) at the end of the
      prefix and pray. (This means 2 colons at the end!)

    - I only have Original 1000, so I could not test with other types
      of bulbs

    - Unlike in lifxlan, set_waveform takes a dictionary with the right
      keys instead of all those parameters
