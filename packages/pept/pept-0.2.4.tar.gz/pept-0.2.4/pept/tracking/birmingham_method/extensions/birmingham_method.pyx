    '''Use the Birmingham Method to find one tracer location from the LoRs
    stored in `lines`.

    Function signature:
        birmingham_method(
            double[:, :] lines,     # LoRs in a sample
            double fopt             # Fraction of LoRs used to find tracer
        )

    This function receives a numpy array of LoRs (one "sample") from python,
    computing the minimum distance point (MDP). A number of lines that lie
    outside the standard deviation of the MDP are then removed from the set,
    and the MDP is recalculated. This process is repeated until approximately
    a fixed fraction (fopt) of the original lines is left.

    The found tracer position is then returned along with a boolean mask of
    the LoRs that were used to compute it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lines : (N, M >= 7) numpy.ndarray
        A numpy array of the lines of respones (LoRs) that will be used to find
        a tracer location; each LoR is stored as a timestamp, the 3D
        coordinates of two points defining the line, followed by any additional
        data. The data columns are then `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, etc]`.
        Note that the extra data is simply ignored by this function.
    fopt : float
        A float number between 0 and 1 representing the fraction of LoRs that
        will be used to compute the tracer location.

    Returns
    -------
    location : (5,) numpy.ndarray
        The computed tracer location, with data columns formatted as
        `[time, x, y, z, error]`.
    used : (N,) numpy.ndarray
        A boolean mask of the LoRs that were used to compute the tracer
        location; that is, a vector of the same length as `lines`, containing 1
        for the rows that were used, and 0 otherwise.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a low-level Cython function that does not do any checks on the
    input data - it is meant to be used in other modules / libraries. For a
    normal user, the `pept.tracking.birmingham_method.BirminghamMethod` class
    methods `fit_sample` and `fit` are recommended as higher-level APIs. They
    do check the input parameters and are easier to use.
