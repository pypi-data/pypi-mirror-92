    '''Find the cutpoints from a sample / array of LoRs.

    A cutpoint is the point in 3D space that minimises the distance between any
    two lines. For any two non-parallel 3D lines, this point corresponds to the
    midpoint of the unique segment that is perpendicular to both lines.

    This function considers every pair of lines in `sample_lines` and returns
    all the cutpoints that satisfy the following conditions:

    1. The distance between the two lines is smaller than `max_distance`.
    2. The cutpoint is within the `cutoffs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_lines : (N, M >= 7) numpy.ndarray
        A sample of LoRs, where each row is `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2]`,
        such that every line is defined by the points `[x1, y1, z1]` and
        `[x2, y2, z2]`.
    max_distance : float
        The maximum distance between any two lines for their cutpoint to be
        considered. A good starting value would be 0.1 mm for small tracers
        and/or clean data, or 0.2 mm for larger tracers and/or noisy data.
    cutoffs : list, optional
        The cutoffs for each dimension, formatted as `[x_min, x_max,
        y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]`. If it is `None`, they are computed
        automatically by calling `get_cutoffs`. The default is `None`.
    append_indices : bool, optional
        If set to `True`, the indices of the individual LoRs that were used
        to compute each cutpoint are also appended to the returned array.
        Default is `False`.

    Returns
    -------
    cutpoints : (M, 4) or (M, 6) numpy.ndarray
        A numpy array of the calculated cutpoints. If `append_indices` is
        `False`, then the columns are [time, x, y, z]. If `append_indices` is
        `True`, then the columns are [time, x, y, z, i, j], where `i` and `j`
        are the LoR indices from `sample_lines` that were used to compute the
        weighted cutpoints. The time is the average between the timestamps of
        the two LoRs that were used to compute the cutpoint. The first column
        (for time) is sorted.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `sample_lines` is not a numpy array with shape (N, M >= 7).
    ValueError
        If `cutoffs` is not a one-dimensional array with values
        `[min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z]`

class Cutpoints(pept.PointData):
    '''Transform LoRs (a `pept.LineData` instance) into *cutpoints* (a
    `pept.PointData` instance) for clustering, in parallel.

    Under typical usage, the `Cutpoints` class is initialised with a
    `pept.LineData` instance, automatically calculating the cutpoints from the
    samples of lines. The `Cutpoints` class inherits from `pept.PointData`,
    such that once the cutpoints have been computed, all the methods from the
    parent class `pept.PointData` can be used on them (such as visualisation
    functionality).

    For more control over the operations, `pept.tracking.peptml.find_cutpoints`
    can be used - it receives a generic numpy array of LoRs (one 'sample') and
    returns a numpy array of cutpoints.

    Attributes
    ----------
    line_data : instance of pept.LineData
        The LoRs for which the cutpoints will be computed. It must be an
        instance of `pept.LineData`.
    max_distance : float
        The maximum distance between any two lines for their cutpoint to be
        considered. A good starting value would be 0.1 mm for small tracers
        and/or clean data, or 0.2 mm for larger tracers and/or noisy data.
    cutoffs : list-like of length 6
        A list (or equivalent) of the cutoff distances for every axis,
        formatted as `[x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]`. Only the
        cutpoints which fall within these cutoff distances are considered. The
        default is None, in which case they are automatically computed using
        `pept.tracking.peptml.get_cutoffs`.
    sample_size, overlap, number_of_lines, etc. : inherited from pept.PointData
        Additional attributes and methods are inherited from the base class
        `PointData`. Check its documentation for more information.

    Methods
    -------
    find_cutpoints(line_data, max_distance, cutoffs = None,\
                   append_indices = False, max_workers = None, verbose = True)
        Compute the cutpoints from the samples in a `LineData` instance.
    sample, to_csv, plot, etc. : inherited from pept.PointData
        Additional attributes and methods are inherited from the base class
        `PointData`. Check its documentation for more information.

    Notes
    -----
    Once instantiated with a `LineData`, the class computes the cutpoints and
    *automatically sets the sample_size* to the average number of cutpoints
    found per sample of LoRs.

    Examples
    --------
    Compute the cutpoints for a `LineData` instance between lines that are less
    than 0.1 apart:

    >>> line_data = pept.LineData(example_data)
    >>> cutpts = peptml.Cutpoints(line_data, 0.1)

    Compute the cutpoints for a single sample:

    >>> sample = line_data[0]
    >>> cutpts_sample = peptml.find_cutpoints(sample, 0.1)
