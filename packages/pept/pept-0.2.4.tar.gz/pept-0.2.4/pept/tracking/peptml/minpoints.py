):
    '''Compute the minimum distance points (MDPs) from all combinations of
    `num_lines` lines given in an array of lines `sample_lines`.

    Given a sample of lines, this functions computes the minimum distance
    points (MDPs) for every possible combination of `num_lines` lines. The
    returned numpy array contains all MDPs that satisfy the following:

    1. Are within the `cutoffs`.
    2. Are closer to all the constituent LoRs than `max_distance`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_lines: (M, N) numpy.ndarray
        A 2D array of lines, where each line is defined by two points such that
        every row is formatted as `[t, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, etc.]`. It
        *must* have at least 2 lines and the combination size `num_lines`
        *must* be smaller or equal to the number of lines. Put differently:
        2 <= num_lines <= len(sample_lines).

    num_lines: int
        The number of lines in each combination of LoRs used to compute the
        MDP. This function considers every combination of `numlines` from the
        input `sample_lines`. It must be smaller or equal to the number of
        input lines `sample_lines`.

    max_distance: float
        The maximum allowed distance between an MDP and its constituent lines.
        If any distance from the MDP to one of its lines is larger than
        `max_distance`, the MDP is thrown away.

    cutoffs: (6,) numpy.ndarray, optional
        An array of spatial cutoff coordinates with *exactly 6 elements* as
        [x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]. If any MDP lies outside
        this region, it is thrown away. If it is `None`, they are computed
        automatically by calling `get_cutoffs`. The default is `None`.

    append_indices: bool, default False
        A boolean specifying whether to include the indices of the lines used
        to compute each MDP. If `False`, the output array will only contain the
        [time, x, y, z] of the MDPs. If `True`, the output array will have
        extra columns [time, x, y, z, line_idx(1), ..., line_idx(n)] where
        n = `num_lines`.

    Returns
    -------
    minpoints: (M, N) numpy.ndarray
        A 2D array of `float`s containing the time and coordinates of the MDPs
        [time, x, y, z]. The time is computed as the average of the constituent
        lines. If `append_indices` is `True`, then `num_lines` indices of the
        constituent lines are appended as extra columns:
        [time, x, y, z, line_idx1, line_idx2, ..]. The first column (for time)
        is sorted.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `sample_lines` is not a numpy array with shape (N, M >= 7).

    ValueError
        If 2 <= num_lines <= len(sample_lines) is not satisfied.

    ValueError
        If `cutoffs` is not a one-dimensional array with values
        `[min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z]`

class Minpoints(pept.PointData):
    '''Transform LoRs (a `pept.LineData` instance) into *minpoints* (a
    `pept.PointData` instance) for clustering, in parallel.

    Given a sample of lines, the minpoints are the minimum distance points
    (MDPs) for every possible combination of `num_lines` lines that satisfy
    the following conditions:

    1. Are within the `cutoffs`.
    2. Are closer to all the constituent LoRs than `max_distance`.

    Under typical usage, the `Minpoints` class is initialised with a
    `pept.LineData` instance, automatically calculating the minpoints from the
    samples of lines. The `Minpoints` class inherits from `pept.PointData`,
    such that once the cutpoints have been computed, all the methods from the
    parent class `pept.PointData` can be used on them (such as visualisation
    functionality).

    For more control over the operations, `pept.tracking.peptml.find_minpoints`
    can be used - it receives a generic numpy array of LoRs (one 'sample') and
    returns a numpy array of cutpoints.

    Attributes
    ----------
    line_data : instance of pept.LineData
        The LoRs for which the cutpoints will be computed. It must be an
        instance of `pept.LineData`.

    num_lines: int
        The number of lines in each combination of LoRs used to compute the
        MDP. This function considers every combination of `num_lines` from the
        input `sample_lines`. It must be smaller or equal to the number of
        input lines `sample_lines`.

    max_distance: float
        The maximum allowed distance between an MDP and its constituent lines.
        If any distance from the MDP to one of its lines is larger than
        `max_distance`, the MDP is thrown away. A good starting value would be
        0.1 mm for small tracers and/or clean data, or 0.2 mm for larger
        tracers and/or noisy data.

    cutoffs : list-like of length 6
        A list (or equivalent) of the cutoff distances for every axis,
        formatted as `[x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]`. Only the
        minpoints which fall within these cutoff distances are considered. The
        default is None, in which case they are automatically computed using
        `pept.tracking.peptml.get_cutoffs`.

    sample_size, overlap, number_of_lines, etc. : inherited from pept.PointData
        Additional attributes and methods are inherited from the base class
        `PointData`. Check its documentation for more information.

    Methods
    -------
    find_minpoints(line_data, num_lines, max_distance, cutoffs = None,\
                   append_indices = False, max_workers = None, verbose = True)
        Compute the minpoints from the samples in a `LineData` instance.

    sample, to_csv, plot, etc. : inherited from pept.PointData
        Additional attributes and methods are inherited from the base class
        `PointData`. Check its documentation for more information.

    Notes
    -----
    Once instantiated with a `LineData`, the class computes the minpoints and
    *automatically sets the sample_size* to the average number of minpoints
    found per sample of LoRs.

    Examples
    --------
    Compute the minpoints for a `LineData` instance for all triplets of lines
    that are less than 0.1 from those lines:

    >>> line_data = pept.LineData(example_data)
    >>> minpts = peptml.Minpoints(line_data, 3, 0.1)

    Compute the minpoints for a single sample:

    >>> sample = line_data[0]
    >>> cutpts_sample = peptml.find_minpoints(sample, 3, 0.1)
