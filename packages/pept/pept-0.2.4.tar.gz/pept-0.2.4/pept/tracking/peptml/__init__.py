'''The `peptml` package implements an efficient, optionally-parallel
hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm for general Positron Emission
Particle Tracking (PEPT).

Summary
-------
A typical workflow for using the `peptml` package would be:

1. Read the LoRs into a `pept.LineData` class instance and set the
   `sample_size` and `overlap` appropriately.
2. Compute the cutpoints using the `pept.tracking.peptml.Cutpoints` class.
3. Instantiate an `pept.tracking.peptml.HDBSCANClusterer` class and cluster the
   cutpoints found previously.
4. Optional: cluster the results from the previous step again for smoother,
   tighter trajectories.

Extended Summary
----------------
The PEPT-ML algorithm [1]_ works using the following steps:

1. Split the data into a series of individual "samples", each containing a
   given number of LoRs. Use the base class pept.LineData for this.
2. For every sample of LoRs, compute the *cutpoints*, or the points in space
   that minimise the distance to every pair of lines.
3. Cluster every sample using HDBSCAN and extract the centres of the clusters
   ("1-pass clustering").
4. Split the centres into samples of a given size.
5. Cluster every sample of centres using HDBSCAN and extract the centres of the
   clusters ("2-pass clustering").
6. Construct the trajectory of every particle using the centres from the
   previous step.

More tutorials and examples can be found on the University of Birmingham
Positron Imaging Centre's GitHub repository.

PEPT-ML was successfuly used at the University of Birmingham to analyse real
Fluorine-18 tracers in air.
