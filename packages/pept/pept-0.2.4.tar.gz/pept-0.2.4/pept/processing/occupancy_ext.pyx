    This corresponds to the pixellisation of circular particles, such that
    each pixel's value corresponds to the area covered by the particle.

    It is important that all parameters sent to this function are initialised
    properly. Please see the parameters below, or the function *will* segfault.
    Alternatively, use the `pept.processing.occupancy2d` function which is
    more robust and initialises all parameters for you.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pixels: (M, N) numpy.ndarray[ndim = 2, dtype = numpy.float64]
        The 2D grid of pixels, initialised to zero. It can be created with
        `numpy.zeros((nrows, ncols))`.

    positions: (P, 2) numpy.ndarray[ndim = 2, dtype = numpy.float64]
        The particles' 2D positions, where all rows are formatted as
        `[x_coordinate, y_coordinate]`.

    radii: (P,) numpy.ndarray[ndim = 1, dtype = numpy.float64]
        The radii of each particle. It must have the same length as
        `positions`.

    xlim: (2,) numpy.ndarray[ndim = 1, dtype = numpy.float64]
        The limits of the system over which the pixels span in the
        x-dimension, formatted as [xmin, xmax].

    ylim: (2,) numpy.ndarray[ndim = 1, dtype = numpy.float64]
        The limits of the system over which the pixels span in the
        y-dimension, formatted as [ymin, ymax].
