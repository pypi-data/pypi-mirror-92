class ParallelScreens(LineData):
    '''A subclass of `LineData` that initialises PEPT data for parallel screens
    PET/PEPT detectors from an input data file or array.

    Provides the same functionality as the `LineData` class while initialising
    `lines` from  **PEPT scanners with two parallel screens**. That is,
    each LoR is defined by two 2D points on two screens separated by a given
    distance.

    **The expected data columns in the file are `[time, x1, y1, x2, y2]`**.
    This is automatically transformed into the standard `lines` format with
    columns being `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2]`, where `z1 = 0` and
    `z2 = screen_separation`.

    `ParallelScreens` can be initialised with a predefined numpy array of LoRs
    or read data from a `.csv` or `.a0n` file or equivalent. The attributes
    and methods are the same as for `pept.LineData`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    sample_size, overlap, number_of_lines, etc.: inherited from `pept.LineData`
        All attributes and methods from the parent class `pept.LineData` are
        available after instantiation. Check its documentation for more
        information.

    Methods
    -------
    to_csv, lines_trace, etc. : inherited from `pept.LineData`
        All attributes and methods from the parent class `pept.LineData` are
        available after instantiation. Check its documentation for more
        information.

    Examples
    --------
    Initialise a `ParallelScreens` array for three LoRs on a parallel screens
    PEPT scanner (i.e. each line is defined by **two** points each) with a
    head separation of 500 mm:

    >>> lors_raw = np.array([
    >>>     [2, 100, 150, 200, 250],
    >>>     [4, 350, 250, 100, 150],
    >>>     [6, 450, 350, 250, 200]
    >>> ])

    >>> screen_separation = 500
    >>> lors = pept.scanners.ParallelScreens(lors_raw, screen_separation)
    >>> Initialising the PEPT data took 0.00038814544677734375 seconds.

    >>> lors
    >>> Class instance that inherits from `pept.LineData`.
    >>> Type:
    >>> <class 'pept.scanners.parallel_screens.parallel_screens.ParallelScreens'>
    >>>
    >>> Attributes
    >>> ----------
    >>> number_of_lines =   3
    >>>
    >>> sample_size =       0
    >>> overlap =           0
    >>> number_of_samples = 1
    >>>
    >>> lines =
    >>> [[  2. 100. 150.   0. 200. 250. 500.]
    >>>  [  4. 350. 250.   0. 100. 150. 500.]
    >>>  [  6. 450. 350.   0. 250. 200. 500.]]
    >>>
    >>> Particular Cases
    >>> ----------------
    >>> > If sample_size == 0, all `lines` are returned as a single sample.
    >>> > If overlap >= sample_size, an error is raised.
    >>> > If overlap < 0, lines are skipped between samples.

    def __init__(
        self,

        screen_separation,
        sample_size = 0,

    ):
        '''ParallelScreens class constructor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filepath_or_array : [str, pathlib.Path, IO] or numpy.ndarray (N, 5)
            A path to a file to be read from or an array for initialisation. A
            path is a string with the (absolute or relative) path to the data
            file or a URL from which the PEPT data will be read. It should
            include the full file name, along with its extension (.csv, .a01,
            etc.).
        screen_separation : float
            The separation (in *mm*) between the two PEPT screens corresponding
            to the `z` coordinate of the second point defining each line. The
            attribute `lines`, with columns
            `[time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2]`, will have `z1 = 0` and
            `z2 = screen_separation`.
        sample_size : int, default 0
            An `int` that defines the number of lines that should be returned
            when iterating over `lines`. A `sample_size` of 0 yields all the
            data as one single sample. A good starting value would be 200 times
            the maximum number of tracers that would be tracked.
        overlap : int, default 0
            An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive samples
            that are returned when iterating over `lines`. An overlap of 0
            implies consecutive samples, while an overlap of
            (`sample_size` - 1) means incrementing the samples by one. A
            negative overlap means skipping values between samples. An error is
            raised if `overlap` is larger than or equal to `sample_size`.
        skiprows : int, default 0
            The number of rows to skip from the beginning of the data file.
            Useful when the data file includes a header of text that should be
            skipped.
        max_rows : int, optional
            The maximum number of rows that will be read from the data file.
        verbose : bool, default True
            An option that enables printing the time taken for the
            initialisation of an instance of the class. Useful when reading
            large files (10gb files for PEPT data is not unheard of).

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If `overlap` >= `sample_size`. Overlap has to be smaller than
            `sample_size`. Note that it can also be negative.
        ValueError
            If the data file does not have the (N, M >= 5) shape.
