class Pixels(np.ndarray):
    '''A class that manages a 2D pixel space, including tools for pixel
    traversal of lines, manipulation and visualisation.

    This class can be instantiated in a couple of ways:

    1. The constructor receives a pre-defined pixel space (i.e. a 2D numpy
       array), along with the space boundaries `xlim` and `ylim`.

    2. The `from_lines` method receives a sample of 2D lines (i.e. a 2D numpy
       array), each defined by two points, creating a pixel space and
       traversing / pixellising the lines.

    3. The `empty` method creates a pixel space filled with zeros.

    This subclasses the `numpy.ndarray` class, so any `Pixels` object acts
    exactly like a 2D numpy array. All numpy methods and operations are valid
    on `Pixels` (e.g. add 1 to all pixels with `pixels += 1`).

    It is possible to add multiple samples of lines to the same pixel space
    using the `add_lines` method.

    Attributes
    ----------
    pixels: (M, N) numpy.ndarray
        The 2D numpy array containing the number of lines that pass through
        each pixel. They are stored as `float`s. This class assumes a uniform
        grid of pixels - that is, the pixel size in each dimension is constant,
        but can vary from one dimension to another. The number of pixels in
        each dimension is defined by `number_of_pixels`.

    number_of_pixels: 2-tuple
        A 2-tuple corresponding to the shape of `pixels`.

    pixel_size: (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lengths of a pixel in the x- and y-dimensions, respectively.

    xlim: (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lower and upper boundaries of the pixellised volume in the
        x-dimension, formatted as [x_min, x_max].

    ylim: (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lower and upper boundaries of the pixellised volume in the
        y-dimension, formatted as [y_min, y_max].

    pixel_grids: list[numpy.ndarray]
        A list containing the pixel gridlines in the x- and y-dimensions.
        Each dimension's gridlines are stored as a numpy of the pixel
        delimitations, such that it has length (M + 1), where M is the number
        of pixels in a given dimension.

    Methods
    -------
    from_lines(lines, number_of_pixels, xlim = None, ylim = None, \
               verbose = True)
        Create a pixel space and traverse / pixellise a given sample of
        `lines`.

    empty(number_of_pixels, xlim, ylim, verbose = False)
        Create an empty pixel space for the 2D rectangle bounded by `xlim` and
        `ylim`.

    get_cutoff(p1, p2)
        Return a numpy array containing the minimum and maximum value found
        across the two input arrays.

    add_lines(lines, verbose = False)
        Pixellise a sample of lines, adding 1 to each pixel traversed, for
        each line in the sample.

    cube_trace(index, color = None, opacity = 0.4, colorbar = True,\
               colorscale = "magma")
        Get the Plotly `Mesh3d` trace for a single pixel at `index`.

    cubes_traces(condition = lambda pixels: pixels > 0, color = None,\
                 opacity = 0.4, colorbar = True, colorscale = "magma")
        Get a list of Plotly `Mesh3d` traces for all pixel selected by the
        `condition` filtering function.

    pixels_trace(condition = lambda pixels: pixels > 0, size = 4,\
                 color = None, opacity = 0.4, colorbar = True,\
                 colorscale = "Magma", colorbar_title = None)
        Create and return a trace for all the pixels in this class, with
        possible filtering.

    heatmap_trace(ix = None, iy = None, iz = None, width = 0,\
                  colorscale = "Magma", transpose = True)
        Create and return a Plotly `Heatmap` trace of a 2D slice through the
        voxels.

    Notes
    -----
    The traversed lines do not need to be fully bounded by the pixel space.
    Their intersection is automatically computed.

    The class saves `pixels` as a **contiguous** numpy array for efficient
    access in C / Cython functions. The inner data can be mutated, but do not
    change the shape of the array after instantiating the class.

    Examples
    --------
    This class is most often instantiated from a sample of lines to pixellise:

    >>> import pept
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> lines = np.arange(70).reshape(10, 7)

    >>> number_of_pixels = [3, 4]
    >>> pixels = pept.Pixels.from_lines(lines, number_of_pixels)
    >>> Initialised Pixels class in 0.0006861686706542969 s.

    >>> print(pixels)
    >>> pixels:
    >>> [[[2. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 2. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

    >>>  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 1. 1. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 1. 1. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

    >>>  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 2. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 1. 2.]]]

    >>> number_of_pixels =    (3, 4, 5)
    >>> pixel_size =          [22.  16.5 13.2]

    >>> xlim =                [ 1. 67.]
    >>> ylim =                [ 2. 68.]
    >>> zlim =                [ 3. 69.]

    >>> pixel_grids:
    >>> [array([ 1., 23., 45., 67.]),
    >>>  array([ 2. , 18.5, 35. , 51.5, 68. ]),
    >>>  array([ 3. , 16.2, 29.4, 42.6, 55.8, 69. ])]

    Note that it is important to define the `number_of_pixels`.

        Creates a `plotly.graph_objects.Surface` object for the centres of
        all pixels encapsulated in a `pept.Pixels` instance, colour-coding the
        pixel value.

        The `condition` parameter is a filtering function that should return
        a boolean mask (i.e. it is the result of a condition evaluation). For
        example `lambda x: x > 0` selects all pixels that have a value larger
        than 0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        condition : function, default `lambda pixels: pixels > 0`
            The filtering function applied to the pixel data before plotting
            it. It should return a boolean mask (a numpy array of the same
            shape, filled with True and False), selecting all pixels that
            should be plotted. The default, `lambda x: x > 0` selects all
            pixels which have a value larger than 0.

        opacity : float, default 0.4
            The opacity of the surface, where 0 is transparent and 1 is fully
            opaque.

        colorscale : str, default "Magma"
            The Plotly scheme for color-coding the voxel values in the input
            data. Typical ones include "Cividis", "Viridis" and "Magma".
            A full list is given at `plotly.com/python/builtin-colorscales/`.
