class IterableSamples(ABC):
    '''An abstract class for iterating through an array (or array-like) in
    samples with potential overlap.

    A class that inherits from ``IterableSamples`` must implement two
    properties:

    ``data_samples``
        The underlying data (e.g. a numpy array) that supports slicing.

    ``data_length``
        The number of items in ``data_samples`` (e.g. for a 2D numpy array,
        this is the number of rows).

    Given an implementor's properties ``data_samples`` (e.g. a numpy array) and
    ``data_length``, this class can yield samples of the data of an adaptive
    ``sample_size`` and ``overlap``, without requiring additional storage.

    The underlying data can be accessed using both indexing (``data[0]``) and
    iteration (``for sample in data: ...``).

    Particular cases:
        1. If sample_size == 0, all data_samples is returned as one single
           sample.
        2. If overlap >= sample_size, an error is raised.
        3. If overlap < 0, lines are skipped between samples.

    Attributes
    ----------
    data_samples : iterable that supports slicing
        An iterable (e.g. numpy array) that supports slicing syntax (data[5:7])
        storing the data that will be iterated over in samples. Must be
        implemented by a subclass!

    data_length : int
        The number of elements in `data_samples`. For a numpy.ndarray, that
        corresponds to len(`line_data`). Must be implemented by a subclass!

    sample_size : int
        An `int`` that defines the number of items that should be returned in
        a single sample when iterating over `data_samples`. A `sample_size` of
        0 yields all the data as one single sample.

    overlap : int, optional
        An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive samples that
        are returned when iterating over `data_samples`. An overlap of 0
        implies consecutive samples, while an overlap of (`sample_size` - 1)
        means incrementing the samples by one. A negative overlap implies
        skipping values between samples. An error is raised if `overlap` is
        larger than or equal to `sample_size`.

    number_of_samples : int
        An `int` that corresponds to the number of samples that can be
        accessed from the class. It takes `overlap` into consideration.

    Methods
    -------
    sample(n)
        Get sample number n (indexed from 0).

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `overlap` >= `sample_size` unless `sample_size` is 0. Overlap
        must be smaller than `sample_size`. Note that it can also be negative.

    See Also
    --------
    pept.LineData : Encapsulate LoRs for ease of iteration and plotting.
    pept.PointData : Encapsulate points for ease of iteration and plotting.

    '''

    def __init__(self, sample_size, overlap):
        '''`IterableSamples` class constructor.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample_size : int
            An `int`` that defines the number of items that should be returned
            in a single sample when iterating over `data_samples`. A
            `sample_size` of 0 yields all the data as one single sample.

        overlap : int, optional
            An `int` that defines the overlap between two consecutive samples
            that are returned when iterating over `data_samples`. An overlap of
            0 implies consecutive samples, while an overlap of
            (`sample_size` - 1) means incrementing the samples by one. A
            negative overlap implies skipping values between samples. An error
            is raised if `overlap` is larger than or equal to `sample_size`.
