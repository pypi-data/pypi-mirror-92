class Voxels(np.ndarray):
    '''A class that manages a single 3D voxel space, including tools for voxel
    traversal of lines, manipulation and visualisation.

    This class can be instantiated in a couple of ways:

    1. The constructor receives a pre-defined voxel space (i.e. a 3D numpy
       array), along with the space boundaries `xlim`, `ylim` and `zlim`.

    2. The `from_lines` method receives a sample of 3D lines (i.e. a 2D numpy
       array), each defined by two points, creating a voxel space and
       traversing / voxellising the lines.

    3. The `empty` method creates a voxel space filled with zeros.

    This subclasses the `numpy.ndarray` class, so any `Voxels` object acts
    exactly like a 3D numpy array. All numpy methods and operations are valid
    on `Voxels` (e.g. add 1 to all voxels with `voxels += 1`).

    It is possible to add multiple samples of lines to the same voxel space
    using the `add_lines` method.

    If you want to voxellise multiple samples of lines, see the `VoxelData`
    class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    voxels: (M, N, P) numpy.ndarray
        The 3D numpy array containing the number of lines that pass through
        each voxel. They are stored as `float`s. This class assumes a uniform
        grid of voxels - that is, the voxel size in each dimension is constant,
        but can vary from one dimension to another. The number of voxels in
        each dimension is defined by `number_of_voxels`.

    number_of_voxels: 3-tuple
        A 3-tuple corresponding to the shape of `voxels`.

    voxel_size: (3,) numpy.ndarray
        The lengths of a voxel in the x-, y- and z-dimensions, respectively.

    xlim: (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lower and upper boundaries of the voxellised volume in the
        x-dimension, formatted as [x_min, x_max].

    ylim: (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lower and upper boundaries of the voxellised volume in the
        y-dimension, formatted as [y_min, y_max].

    zlim: (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lower and upper boundaries of the voxellised volume in the
        z-dimension, formatted as [z_min, z_max].

    voxel_grids: list[numpy.ndarray]
        A list containing the voxel gridlines in the x-, y-, and z-dimensions.
        Each dimension's gridlines are stored as a numpy of the voxel
        delimitations, such that it has length (M + 1), where M is the number
        of voxels in given dimension.

    Methods
    -------
    from_lines(lines, number_of_voxels, xlim = None, ylim = None, zlim = None,\
               verbose = True)
        Create a voxel space and traverse / voxellise a given sample of
        `lines`.

    empty(number_of_voxels, xlim, ylim, zlim, verbose = False)
        Create an empty voxel space for the 3D cube bounded by `xlim`,
        `ylim` and `zlim`.

    get_cutoff(p1, p2)
        Return a numpy array containing the minimum and maximum value found
        across the two input arrays.

    add_lines(lines, verbose = False)
        Voxellise a sample of lines, adding 1 to each voxel traversed, for
        each line in the sample.

    cube_trace(index, color = None, opacity = 0.4, colorbar = True,\
               colorscale = "magma")
        Get the Plotly `Mesh3d` trace for a single voxel at `index`.

    cubes_traces(condition = lambda voxels: voxels > 0, color = None,\
                 opacity = 0.4, colorbar = True, colorscale = "magma")
        Get a list of Plotly `Mesh3d` traces for all voxels selected by the
        `condition` filtering function.

    voxels_trace(condition = lambda voxel_data: voxel_data > 0, size = 4,\
                 color = None, opacity = 0.4, colorbar = True,\
                 colorscale = "Magma", colorbar_title = None)
        Create and return a trace for all the voxels in this class, with
        possible filtering.

    heatmap_trace(ix = None, iy = None, iz = None, width = 0,\
                  colorscale = "Magma", transpose = True)
        Create and return a Plotly `Heatmap` trace of a 2D slice through the
        voxels.

    Notes
    -----
    The traversed lines do not need to be fully bounded by the voxel space.
    Their intersection is automatically computed.

    The class saves `voxels` as a **contiguous** numpy array for efficient
    access in C / Cython functions. The inner data can be mutated, but do not
    change the shape of the array after instantiating the class.

    Examples
    --------
    This class is most often instantiated from a sample of lines to voxellise:

    >>> import pept
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> lines = np.arange(70).reshape(10, 7)

    >>> number_of_voxels = [3, 4, 5]
    >>> voxels = pept.Voxels.from_lines(lines, number_of_voxels)
    >>> Initialised Voxels class in 0.0006861686706542969 s.

    >>> print(voxels)
    >>> voxels:
    >>> [[[2. 1. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 2. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

    >>>  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 1. 1. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 1. 1. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

    >>>  [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 2. 0.]
    >>>   [0. 0. 0. 1. 2.]]]

    >>> number_of_voxels =    (3, 4, 5)
    >>> voxel_size =          [22.  16.5 13.2]

    >>> xlim =                [ 1. 67.]
    >>> ylim =                [ 2. 68.]
    >>> zlim =                [ 3. 69.]

    >>> voxel_grids:
    >>> [array([ 1., 23., 45., 67.]),
    >>>  array([ 2. , 18.5, 35. , 51.5, 68. ]),
    >>>  array([ 3. , 16.2, 29.4, 42.6, 55.8, 69. ])]

    Note that it is important to define the `number_of_voxels`.

        a boolean mask (i.e. it is the result of a condition evaluation). For
        example `lambda x: x > 0` selects all voxels that have a value larger
        than 0.

        Parameters
        ----------
        condition : function, default `lambda voxel_data: voxel_data > 0`
            The filtering function applied to the voxel data before plotting
            it. It should return a boolean mask (a numpy array of the same
            shape, filled with True and False), selecting all voxels that

            z is horizontal, y points upwards. Because Matplotlib cannot swap
            axes, this is achieved by swapping the parameters in the plotting

            The Plotly scheme for color-coding the voxel values in the input
            data. Typical ones include "Cividis", "Viridis" and "Magma".
            A full list is given at `plotly.com/python/builtin-colorscales/`.
            Only has an effect if `colorbar = True` and `color` is not set.

class VoxelData:
    '''A class that can voxellise multiple samples of lines (from a `LineData`)
    in parallel, lazily / on demand.

    Voxellisation is a computationally-intensive step - in terms of both time
    and memory - especially for many thousands of lines or samples; although
    optimised, the `Voxels` class only manages a single voxel space. The simple
    solution for multiple samples:

    .. code-block:: python

        lines = pept.LineData(...)
        voxels = []

        for sample in lines:
            voxels.append( pept.Voxels(sample, (100, 100, 100)) )


    Is very inefficient, as it uses a single thread and stores all voxel
    spaces in memory (voxels use up a lot of memory!). This class solves these
    problems by:

    1. Voxellising the samples of lines in parallel, on any number of threads.
    2. Creating the voxel spaces on demand. Optionally, it can save / cache
       the expensive voxellisation steps (`save = True`).

    The individual voxellisation steps are still done using `Voxels`, which are
    then accessible in a list (`voxels.voxels` or `voxels[0]`).

    Attributes
    ----------
    line_data : pept.LineData
        The samples of lines encapsulated in a `pept.LineData` that will be
        used to create the corresponding voxellised spaces.

    voxels : list[pept.Voxels | None]
        The list of cached voxellised spaces. Initially, it is a list of
        `None`s of the same length as the number of samples in `line_data`. If
        `save` is True, the voxellised samples of lines will be cached here.

    number_of_voxels : 3-tuple
        A 3-tuple corresponding to the shape of `voxels`.

    xlim : (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lower and upper boundaries of the voxellised volume in the
        x-dimension, formatted as [x_min, x_max].

    ylim : (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lower and upper boundaries of the voxellised volume in the
        y-dimension, formatted as [y_min, y_max].

    zlim : (2,) numpy.ndarray
        The lower and upper boundaries of the voxellised volume in the
        z-dimension, formatted as [z_min, z_max].

    max_workers : int
        The number of threads that will be used to voxellise the lines in
        parallel.

    save : bool
        Whether to cache the voxellised spaces *when their computation is
        requested* (e.g. when calling `traverse()`). The `voxels` attribute is
        only populated if this is `True`.

    executor : concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor
        The pool of threads managed by this class, used for voxellising the
        samples of lines asynchronously.

    Methods
    -------
    traverse(sample_indices = ..., verbose = True)
        Voxellise the samples in `line_data` at indices `samples_indices`.

    accumulate(sample_indices = ..., verbose = True):
        Superimpose the voxellised samples in `line_data` at indices
        `samples_indices` into the same voxel space.

    Notes
    -----
    Upon instantiating the class with an instance of `LineData`, a copy is
    made. It is a logic error to change the `sample_size` and `overlap` after
    instantiation; these should remain constant for the `voxels` list to
    remain correct.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a short list of 3D lines and encapsulate them in a `LineData` class
    to simulate multiple samples of lines.

    >>> import pept
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> lines_raw = np.arange(70).reshape(10, 7)
    >>> lines = pept.LineData(lines_raw, sample_size = 2)

    The `VoxelData` does not voxellise the samples of lines immediately upon
    instantiation by default:

    >>> number_of_voxels = [3, 4, 5]
    >>> voxel_data = pept.VoxelData(lines, number_of_voxels)
    >>> voxel_data.voxels
    >>> [None, None, None, None, None]

    You can iterate through the `VoxelData` and it will voxellise the samples
    on demand, in parallel:

    >>> for vox in voxel_data:
    >>>     print(vox)          # not cached by default

    This is the most efficient way to use `VoxelData`, as the voxellised
    samples are NOT cached by default; they are deleted after each loop above
    (the voxels consume a lot of memory!):

    >>> voxel_data.voxels
    >>> [None, None, None, None, None]

    If you have enough memory to store all the voxel spaces at once, set `save`
    to True when instantiating the class, or afterwards:

    >>> number_of_voxels = [3, 4, 5]
    >>> voxel_data = pept.VoxelData(lines, number_of_voxels, save = True)
    >>> voxel_data.voxels
    >>> [None, None, None, None, None]

    >>> voxel_data.traverse()               # Actually voxellises each sample
    >>> voxel_data.voxels
    >>> [..Voxels.. , ..Voxels.., ...]

    If you voxellised the samples once and `save = True`, the results are
    cached, so new iterations use the pre-computed voxel spaces:

    >>> voxel_data.accumulate()             # Almost instantaneous, uses cache

        If `save` is `True`, the voxellised spaces are also cached in the
        `voxels` attribute. Otherwise, they are only returned as a list.

        Parameters
        ----------
        sample_indices : int or iterable or Ellipsis, default Ellipsis
            The index or indices of the samples of lines. An `int` signifies
            the sample index, an iterable (list-like) signifies multiple sample
            indices, while an Ellipsis (`...`) signifies all samples. The
            default is `...` (all samples).

        verbose : bool, default True
            Show extra information as the voxellisation runs.

        Returns
        -------
        list[Voxels]
            A list of the voxellised samples of lines (each as a `Voxels`
            class) selected by `sample_indices`.

        Examples
        --------
        This method is automatically called if the instantiation of the class
        sets `traverse = True`:

        >>> import pept
        >>> import numpy as np

        >>> lines_raw = np.arange(70).reshape(10, 7)
        >>> lines = pept.LineData(lines_raw, sample_size = 2)

        >>> number_of_voxels = [3, 4, 5]
        >>> voxel_data = pept.VoxelData(
        >>>     lines, number_of_voxels, traverse = True
        >>> )
        >>> voxel_data.voxels
        >>> [..Voxels.. , ..Voxels.., ...]

        You can also call the method after the instantiation. If the results
        were cached (i.e. `save = True`), they are returned without
        re-computing them:

        >>> voxel_list = voxel_data.traverse()

        Alternatively, you can only voxellise a few samples at once (still in
        parallel):

        >>> voxel_list = voxel_data.traverse([1, 5, 2])

        Of course, the list of `Voxels` will have the same ordering as the
        list of indices given to the function.

        Returns

        Voxels
            The single voxellised space that contains the superimposed

        --------
