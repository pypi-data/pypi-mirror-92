        Function signature:
            find_minpoints(
                double[:, :] sample_lines,  # LoRs in sample
                Py_ssize_t num_lines,       # Number of LoRs in combinations

                bool append_indices = 0     # Append LoR indices used
            )

    Given a sample of lines, this functions computes the minimum distance
    points (MDPs) for every possible combination of `num_lines` lines. The
    returned numpy array contains all MDPs that satisfy the following:

    1. Are within the `cutoffs`.
    2. Are closer to all the constituent LoRs than `max_distance`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_lines: (M, N) numpy.ndarray
        A 2D array of lines, where each line is defined by two points such that
        every row is formatted as `[t, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, etc.]`. It
        *must* have at least 2 lines and the combination size `num_lines`
        *must* be smaller or equal to the number of lines. Put differently:
        2 <= num_lines <= len(sample_lines).

    num_lines: int
        The number of lines in each combination of LoRs used to compute the
        MDP. This function considers every combination of `numlines` from the
        input `sample_lines`. It must be smaller or equal to the number of input
        lines `sample_lines`.

    max_distance: float
        The maximum allowed distance between an MDP and its constituent lines.
        If any distance from the MDP to one of its lines is larger than
        `max_distance`, the MDP is thrown away.

    cutoffs: (6,) numpy.ndarray
        An array of spatial cutoff coordinates with *exactly 6 elements* as
        [x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max]. If any MDP lies outside
        this region, it is thrown away.

    append_indices: bool
        A boolean specifying whether to include the indices of the lines used
        to compute each MDP. If `False`, the output array will only contain the
        [time, x, y, z] of the MDPs. If `True`, the output array will have
        extra columns [time, x, y, z, line_idx(1), ..., line_idx(n)] where
        n = `num_lines`.

    Returns
    -------
    minpoints: (M, N) numpy.ndarray
        A 2D array of `float`s containing the time and coordinates of the MDPs
        [time, x, y, z]. The time is computed as the average of the constituent
        lines. If `append_indices` is `True`, then `num_lines` indices of the
        constituent lines are appended as extra columns:
        [time, x, y, z, line_idx1, line_idx2, ..].

    Notes
    -----
    There must be at least two lines in `sample_lines` and `num_lines` must be
    greater or equal to the number of lines (i.e. `len(sample_lines)`).
    Put another way: 2 <= num_lines <= len(sample_lines).

    This is a low-level Cython function that does not do any checks on the
    input data - it is meant to be used in other modules / libraries. For a
    normal user, the `pept.tracking.peptml` function `find_minpoints` and
    class `Minpoints` are recommended as higher-level APIs. They do check the
    input data and are easier to use (for example, they automatically compute
    the cutoffs).

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from pept.utilities import find_minpoints
    >>>
    >>> lines = np.random.random((500, 7)) * 500
    >>> num_lines = 3
    >>> max_distance = 0.1
    >>> cutoffs = np.array([0, 500, 0, 500, 0, 500], dtype = float)
    >>>
    >>> minpoints = find_minpoints(lines, num_lines, max_distance, cutoffs)
