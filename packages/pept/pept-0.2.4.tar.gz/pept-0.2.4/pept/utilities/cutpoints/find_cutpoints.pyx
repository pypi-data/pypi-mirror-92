    ::

        Function signature:
            find_cutpoints(
                double[:, :] sample_lines,  # LoRs in sample
                double max_distance,        # Max distance between two LoRs
                double[:] cutoffs,          # Spatial cutoff for cutpoints
                bint append_indices = False # Append LoR indices used
            )

    This is a low-level Cython function that does not do any checks on the
    input data - it is meant to be used in other modules / libraries. For a
    normal user, the `pept.tracking.peptml` function `find_cutpoints` and
    class `Cutpoints` are recommended as higher-level APIs. They do check the
    input data and are easier to use (for example, they automatically compute
    the cutoffs).

    A cutpoint is the point in 3D space that minimises the distance between any
    two lines. For any two non-parallel 3D lines, this point corresponds to the
    midpoint of the unique segment that is perpendicular to both lines.

    This function considers every pair of lines in `sample_lines` and returns
    all the cutpoints that satisfy the following conditions:

    1. The distance between the two lines is smaller than `max_distance`.
    2. The cutpoints are within the `cutoffs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_lines : (N, M >= 7) numpy.ndarray
        The sample of lines, where each row is [time, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2],
        containing two points [x1, y1, z1] and [x2, y2, z2] defining an LoR.
    max_distance : float
        The maximum distance between two LoRs for their cutpoint to be
        considered.
    cutoffs : (6,) numpy.ndarray
        Only consider the cutpoints that fall within the cutoffs. `cutoffs` has
        the format [min_x, max_x, min_y, max_y, min_z, max_z].
    append_indices : bool, optional
        If set to `True`, the indices of the individual LoRs that were used
        to compute each cutpoint is also appended to the returned array.
        Default is `False`.

    Returns
    -------
    cutpoints : (M, 4) or (M, 6) numpy.ndarray
        A numpy array of the calculated weighted cutpoints. If `append_indices`
        is `False`, then the columns are [time, x, y, z]. If `append_indices`
        is `True`, then the columns are [time, x, y, z, i, j], where `i` and
        `j` are the LoR indices from `sample_lines` that were used to compute
        the cutpoints. The time is the average between the timestamps of the
        two LoRs that were used to compute the cutpoint. The first column (for
        time) is sorted.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from pept.utilities import find_cutpoints
    >>>
    >>> lines = np.random.random((500, 7)) * 500
    >>> max_distance = 0.1
    >>> cutoffs = np.array([0, 500, 0, 500, 0, 500], dtype = float)
    >>>
    >>> cutpoints = find_cutpoints(lines, max_distance, cutoffs)
