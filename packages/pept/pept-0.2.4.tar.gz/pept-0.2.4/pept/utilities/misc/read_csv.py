    This is a convenience function that's simply a proxy to `pandas.read_csv`,

    PEPT data.

    Most importantly, it reads from a **space-separated values** file at

    `nrows` lines. It returns a `numpy.ndarray` with `float` values.

    The parameters below are sent to `pandas.read_csv` with no further parsing.
    The descriptions below are taken from the `pandas` documentation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath_or_buffer : str, path object or file-like object
        Any valid string path is acceptable. The string could be a URL. Valid
        URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a host is
        expected. A local file could be: file://localhost/path/to/table.csv. If
        you want to pass in a path object, pandas accepts any `os.PathLike`. By
        file-like object, we refer to objects with a `read()` method, such as a
        file handler (e.g. via builtin `open` function) or `StringIO`.
    skiprows : list-like, int or callable, optional
        Line numbers to skip (0-indexed) or number of lines to skip (int) at
        the start of the file.
    nrows : int, optional
        Number of rows of file to read. Useful for reading pieces of large
        files.
    dtype : Type name, default `float`
        Data type for data or columns. E.g. {‘a’: np.float64, ‘b’: np.int32,
        ‘c’: ‘Int64’}.
    sep : str, default `"\s+"`
        Delimiter to use. Separators longer than 1 character and different from
        '\s+' will be interpreted as regular expressions and will also force
        the use of the Python parsing engine.
    header : int, list of int, "infer", optional
        Row number(s) to use as the column names, and the start of the data. By
        default assume there is no header present (i.e. `header = None`).
    engine : {‘c’, ‘python’}, default "c"
        Parser engine to use. The C engine is faster while the python engine is
        currently more feature-complete.
    na_filter : bool, default `True`
        Detect missing value markers (empty strings and the value of
        na_values). In data without any NAs, passing na_filter=False can
        improve the performance of reading a large file.
    quoting : int or csv.QUOTE_* instance, default `csv.QUOTE_NONE`
        Control field quoting behavior per csv.QUOTE_* constants. Use one of
        QUOTE_MINIMAL (0), QUOTE_ALL (1), QUOTE_NONNUMERIC (2) or
        QUOTE_NONE (3).
    memory_map : bool, default True
        If a filepath is provided for filepath_or_buffer, map the file object
        directly onto memory and access the data directly from there. Using
        this option can improve performance because there is no longer any I/O
        overhead.
    kwargs : optional
        Extra keyword arguments that will be passed to `pandas.read_csv`.

class ChunkReader:
    '''Class for fast, on-demand reading / parsing and iteration over chunks of
    data from CSV files.

    This is an abstraction above `pandas.read_csv` for easy and fast iteration
    over chunks of data from a CSV file. The chunks can be accessed using
    normal iteration (`for chunk in reader: ...`) and subscripting
    (`reader[0]`).

    The chunks are read lazily, only upon access. It is therefore a more
    efficient alternative to `read_csv` for large files (> 1.000.000 lines).
    For convenience, this class configures some default parameters for
    `pandas.read_csv` for fast reading and parsing of usual PEPT data.

    Most importantly, it reads chunks containing `chunksize` lines from a
    **space-separated values** file at `filepath_or_buffer`, optionally
    skipping `skiprows` lines and reading in at most `nrows` lines. It returns
    `numpy.ndarray`s with `float` values.

    Attributes
    ----------
    filepath_or_buffer : str, path object or file-like object
        Any valid string path is acceptable. The string could be a URL.
        Valid URL schemes include http, ftp, s3, and file. For file URLs, a
        host is expected. A local file could be
        file://localhost/path/to/table.csv. If you want to pass in a path
        object, pandas accepts any `os.PathLike`. By file-like object, we
        refer to objects with a `read()` method, such as a file handler
        (e.g. via builtin `open` function) or `StringIO`.
    number_of_chunks : int
        The number of chunks (also returned when using the `len` method),
        taking into account the lines skipped (`skiprows`), the number of lines
        in the file (`file_lines`) and the maximum number of lines to be read
        (`nrows`).
    file_lines : int
        The number of lines in the file pointed at by `filepath_or_buffer`.
    chunksize : int
        The number of lines in a chunk of data.
    skiprows : int
        The number of lines to be skipped at the beginning of the file.
    nrows : int
        The maximum number of lines to be read. Only has an effect if it is
        less than `file_lines` - `skiprows`. For example, if a file has
        10 lines and `skiprows` = 5 and `chunksize` = 5, even if `nrows` were
        to be 20, the `number_of_chunks` should still be 1.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        Upon access to a non-existent chunk using subscript notation
        (i.e. `data[100]` when there are 50 chunks).

    Examples
    --------
    Say "data.csv" contains 1_000_000 lines of data. Read chunks of 10_000
    lines as a time, skipping the first 100_000:

    >>> from pept.utilities import ChunkReader
    >>> chunks = ChunkReader("data.csv", 10_000, skiprows = 100_000)
    >>> len(chunks)         # 90 chunks
    >>> chunks.file_lines   # 1_000_000

    Normal iteration:

    >>> for chunk in chunks:
    >>>     ... # neat operations

    Access a single chunk using subscripting:

    >>> chunks[0]   # First chunk
    >>> chunks[-1]  # Last chunk
    >>> chunks[100] # IndexError
