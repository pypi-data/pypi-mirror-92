            )

    This function computes the number of lines that passes through each pixel,
    saving the result in `pixels`. It does so in an efficient manner, in which
    for every line, only the pixels that it passes through are traversed.

    As it is highly optimised, this function does not perform any checks on the
    validity of the input data. Please check the parameters before calling
    `traverse2d`, as it WILL segfault on wrong input data. Details are given
    below, along with an example call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pixels : numpy.ndarray(dtype = numpy.float64, ndim = 2)
        The `pixels` parameter is a numpy.ndarray of shape (X, Y) that has been
        initialised to zeros before the function call. The values will be
        modified in-place in the function to reflect the number of lines that
        pass through each pixel.

    lines : numpy.ndarray(dtype = numpy.float64, ndim = 2)
        The `lines` parameter is a numpy.ndarray of shape(N, 5), where each row
        is formatted as [time, x1, y1, x2, y2]. Only indices 1:5 will be used
        as the two points P1 = [x1, y1] and P2 = [x2, y2] defining the line (or
        LoR).

    grid_x : numpy.ndarray(dtype = numpy.float64, ndim = 1)
        The grid_x parameter is a one-dimensional grid that delimits the pixels
        in the x-dimension. It must be *sorted* in ascending order with
        *equally-spaced* numbers and length X + 1 (pixels.shape[0] + 1).

    grid_y : numpy.ndarray(dtype = numpy.float64, ndim = 1)
        The grid_y parameter is a one-dimensional grid that delimits the pixels
        in the y-dimension. It must be *sorted* in ascending order with
        *equally-spaced* numbers and length Y + 1 (pixels.shape[1] + 1).

    Examples
    --------
    The input parameters can be easily generated using numpy before calling the
    function. For example, if a plane of 300 x 400 is split into
    30 x 40 pixels, a possible code would be:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from pept.utilities.traverse import traverse2d
    >>>
    >>> plane = [300, 400]
    >>> number_of_pixels = [30, 40]
    >>> pixels = np.zeros(number_of_pixels)

    The grid has one extra element than the number of pixels. For example, 5
    pixels between 0 and 5 would be delimited by the grid [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    which has 6 elements (see off-by-one errors - story of my life).

    >>> grid_x = np.linspace(0, plane[0], number_of_pixels[0] + 1)
    >>> grid_y = np.linspace(0, plane[1], number_of_pixels[1] + 1)
    >>>
    >>> random_lines = np.random.random((100, 5)) * 100

    Calling `traverse2d` will modify `pixels` in-place.

    >>> traverse2d(pixels, random_lines, grid_x, grid_y)

    Notes
    -----
    This function is an adaptation of a widely-used algorithm [1]_, optimised
    for PEPT LoRs traversal.
