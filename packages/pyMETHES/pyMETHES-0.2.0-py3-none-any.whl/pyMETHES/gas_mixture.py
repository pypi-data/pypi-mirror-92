"""
Module for the GasMixture class, which aggregates data of different gases.

The GasMixture uses the cross_section module to read cross section data. It stores
linear interpolations of each cross section, as well as the mass ratio,
energy threshold and type of cross section, which are needed for the simulation.
The proportions of the gas mixture should sum up to 1. A common energy_vector for all
cross sections is calculated, as well as the total_cross_section.
