# PhishDetect Admin

This software is part of the PhishDetect project.

This is a simple Flask web application that is meant to run locally in order to remotely connect and manage a PhishDetect Node. You can simply install it with:

```
pip3 install phishdetect-admin
```
If you haven't already done so, add the pip binaries directory to your path by placing the following in your `~/.bashrc` file:

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

Once installed, you can launch it with:

```
phishdetect-admin
```

It will spawn a local webserver and automatically open a tab on your default browser pointing to it. You will then be asked to configure the PhishDetet Node you wish to operate by providing the base URL (e.g. https://phishdetect.example.com) and your admin API key.
