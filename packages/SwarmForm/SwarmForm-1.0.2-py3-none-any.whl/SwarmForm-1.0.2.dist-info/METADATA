**SwarmForm**

SwarmForm is a distributed workflow management system for High Performance Computing environments. SwarmForm introduces task clustering to reduce the makespan of workflows executed using it by minimizing the overheads. SwarmForm follows a distributed architecture with independent programs controlling different functional layers in workflow management.

**Getting Started**

These instructions will get you familiar with the installation and basic functions of the SwarmForm.

**_Prerequisites_**

Following prerequisites should be installed to run SwarmForm.

* MongoDB
* Python 3.3+
* pip

**_Installation_**

To install SwarmForm, simply type

```
pip install SwarmForm
```

**_Basic Usage_**

Following is a step by step series of examples that tell you how to use the basic system functions.

* Initialize a SwarmForm launchpad YAML file

```
sform init
```


* Insert a SwarmFlow from file

```
sform add -sf <file path>
```

* Get SwarmFlow from SwarmPad

```
sform get_sf -id <SwarmFlow ID>
```

* Cluster the fireworks in the SwarmFlow and save the new SwarmFlow to the database

```
sform cluster -sf <SwarmFlow ID>
```
or

```
sform cluster -sf <SwarmFlow ID> -a <clustering algorithm rac/wpa> -cc <cluster count>
```

* Reset and re-initialize the SwarmForm database

```
sform reset
```
