    python-cloudkittyclient has been completely rewritten in order to be easier
    to maintain. It is now built with cliff.
features:
  - |
    * Client-side CSV report generation: It is possible for users to generate
      CSV reports with the new client. There is a default format, but reports
      may also be configured through a yaml config file. (see documentation)

    * The documentation has been improved. (A few examples on how to use the
      python library + complete API bindings and CLI reference).

    * It is now possible to use the client without Keystone authentication
      (this requires that CK's API is configured to use the noauth auth
      strategy).

    * Various features are brought by cliff: completion, command output
      formatting (table, shell, yaml, json...).

    * The 'python-cloudkittyclient' module is now compatible with python 2.7 and
      3.5 .

    * Integration tests (for 'openstack rating' and 'cloudkitty') have been
      added. These should allow to create gate jobs running against a
      CK devstack.

    * Tests are now ran with stestr instead of testr, which allows a better
      control over execution.

    * The dependency list has been reduced and upper constraints have been set.

    * Simplification of commands. Most commands are now more http-like: no more
      'list' and 'get' commands, but only 'get' with or without a resource ID.
