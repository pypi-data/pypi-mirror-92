    The client has been adapted to allow adding support for v2 API
    endpoints. The v2 client class implements all v1 endpoints, but v1
    endpoints ported to v2 will be overriden. The API version to use can be
    specified through the ``--os-rating-api-version`` option or the
    ``OS_RATING_API_VERSION``.
