ADS Management
==============

.. note:: To enable the ADS functionality, first you need to obtain an ADS token [#ADStoken]_, and set it into the ``ads_tokend`` config parameter.  To do this:

  1. Create an account and login into the new `ADS system <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/?bbbRedirect=1#user/account/login>`_.

  2. Get your token (or generate a new one) from `here <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#user/settings/token>`_.

  3. Set the ``ads_token`` bibmanager parameter:

  .. code-block:: shell

    # Set ads_token to 'my_ads_token':
    bibm config ads_token my_ads_token

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ads-search
----------

Do a query on ADS.

**Usage**

.. code-block:: shell

  bibm ads-search [-h] [-n] [-a] [-f] [-o]

**Description**

This command enables ADS querries.  The query syntax is identical to
a query in the new ADS's one-box search engine:
https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu.
Here there is a detailed documentations for ADS searches:
https://adsabs.github.io/help/search/search-syntax
See below for typical query examples.

| If you set the ``-a/--add`` flag, the code will prompt to add
  entries to the database right after showing the ADS search results.
  Similarly, set the ``-f/--fetch`` or ``-o/--open`` flags to prompt
  to fetch or open PDF files right after showing the ADS search
  results.  Note that you can combine these to add and fetch/open at
  the same time (e.g., ``bibm ads-search -a -o``), or you can
  fetch/open PDFs that are not in the database (e.g., ``bibm
  ads-search -o``).
| *(New since version 1.2.7)*

.. note:: Note that a query will display at most 'ads_display' entries on
  screen at once (see ``bibm config ads_display``).  If a query matches
  more entries, the user can execute ``bibm ads-search -n``
  to display the next set of entries.

.. caution:: When making an ADS query, note that
  ADS requires the field values (when necessary) to use `double` quotes.
  For example: `author:"^Fortney, J"`.

**Options**

| **-n, -\\-next**
|       Display next set of entries that matched the previous query.
|
| **-a, -\\-add**
|        Query to add an entry after displaying the search results.
|        *(New since version 1.2.7)*
|
| **-f, -\\-fetch**
|        Query to fetch a PDF after displaying the search results.
|        *(New since version 1.2.7)*
|
| **-o, -\\-open**
|        Query to fetch/open a PDF after displaying the search results.
|        *(New since version 1.2.7)*
|
| **-h, -\\-help**
|       Show this help message and exit.

ads-add
-------

Add entries from ADS by bibcode into the bibmanager database.

**Usage**

.. code-block:: shell

  bibm ads-add [-h] [-f] [-o] [bibcode key]

**Description**

This command add BibTeX entries from ADS by specifying pairs of
ADS bibcodes and BibTeX keys.

Executing this command without arguments (i.e., ``bibm ads-add``) launches
an interactive prompt session allowing the user to enter multiple
bibcode, key pairs.

By default, added entries replace previously existent entries in the
bibmanager database.

| With the optional arguments ``-f/--fetch`` or ``-o/--open``, the
  code will attempt to fetch and fetch/open (respectively) the
  associated PDF files of the added entries.
| *(New since version 1.2.7)*

**Options**

| **bibcode**
|       The ADS bibcode of an entry.
|
| **key**
|       BibTeX key to assign to the entry.
|
| **-f, -\\-fetch**
|       Fetch the PDF of the added entries.
|       *(New since version 1.2.7)*
|
| **-o, -\\-open**
|       Fetch and open the PDF of the added entries.
|       *(New since version 1.2.7)*
|
| **-h, -\\-help**
|       Show this help message and exit.

.. _ads-update:

ads-update
----------

Update bibmanager database cross-checking entries with ADS.

**Usage**

.. code-block:: shell

  bibm ads-update [-h] [update_keys]

**Description**

This command triggers an ADS search of all entries in the ``bibmanager``
database that have a ``bibcode``.  Replacing these entries with
the output from ADS.
The main utility of this command is to auto-update entries that
were added as arXiv version, with their published version.

For arXiv updates, this command updates automatically the year and
journal of the key (where possible).  This is done by searching for
the year and the string `'arxiv'` in the key, using the bibcode info.
For example, an entry with key `'NameEtal2010arxivGJ436b'` whose bibcode
changed from `'2010arXiv1007.0324B'` to `'2011ApJ...731...16B'`, will have
a new key `'NameEtal2011apjGJ436b'`.
To disable this feature, set the ``update_keys`` optional argument to `'no'`.

**Options**

| **update_keys**
|       Update the keys of the entries. (choose from: {no, arxiv}, default: arxiv).
|
| **-h, -\\-help**
|       Show this help message and exit.

**Examples**

.. note::  These example outputs assume that you merged the sample bibfile
  already, i.e.: ``bibm merge ~/.bibmanager/examples/sample.bib``

.. code-block:: shell

  # Look at this entry with old info from arXiv:

  arXiv url: http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.0324
  key: BeaulieuEtal2011apjGJ436b

.. note::  There might be cases when one does not want to ADS-update an
    entry.  To prevent this to happen, the user can set the *freeze*
    meta-parameter through the ``bibm edit`` command (see :ref:`edit`).
