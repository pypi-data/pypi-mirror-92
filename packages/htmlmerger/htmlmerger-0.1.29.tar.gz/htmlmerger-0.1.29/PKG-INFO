        # HtmlMerger
        
        A package allowing to merge all html files in a directory in a single file.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/pcotteadvestis/htmlmerger
        cd htmlmerger
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```
        pip install htmlmerger
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Merges html files into a fingle file
        
        For each file, will extract the content between the <html><body><head> ... <\\head><\\body><\\html> or
        <html><body> ... <\\body><\\html> and put all those contents between those same tags in a new file. Simple as
        that.
        
        You can either give a list of files or a directory as input, and if not specified the output will be
        input_directory/merged.html, or ./merged.html. You can also pass the argument "clean=True" when calling merge() to
        delete the
        individual files
        used for merging.
        
        Supports transparentpath objects.
        
        ```python
        from htmlmerger import HtmlMerger
        merger = HtmlMerger(input_directory="my_htmls/")  # result will be in my_htmls/merged.html
        merger.merge(clean=True)  # or clean=False to keep the individual files (default behavior)
        
        from pathlib import Path
        merger = HtmlMerger(files=Path("my_htmls/").glob("*"))  # result will be in ./merged.html
        merger.merge()
        ```
