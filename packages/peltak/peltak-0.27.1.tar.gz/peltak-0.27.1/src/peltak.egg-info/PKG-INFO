        **peltak**'s goal is to simplify day-to-day dev tasks that we all, as developers,
        have to do. It does not try to be a build system or to replace any of the tools
        you would normally use when developing project like test runners, linters, etc.
        Think of it rather as a replacement for the shell scripts that usually wrap
        those tools. It actually started years ago as a collection of those shell
        scripts that with time evolved into a very flexible, extensible and easy to use
        command line app.

        Enabling auto-completion
        ------------------------
        **peltak** has a great auto-completion thanks to the underlying click library.
        The steps to enable it vary slightly depending on what shell you are using
        
        **Bash users**
        
            Either run this command or to make the change permanent add it to your
            ``~/.bashrc``:
        
            .. code-block:: shell
        
                eval "$(_PELTAK_COMPLETE=source peltak)"
        
        **ZSH users**
            Either run this command or to make the change permanent add it to your
            ``~/.zshrc``:
        
            .. code-block:: shell
        
                eval "$(_PELTAK_COMPLETE=source_zsh peltak)"
