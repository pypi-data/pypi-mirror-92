Description: # mobility-mapper
        
        This app allows allows for the scoring of behavioral videos involving mobility (or any other binary behavior). The behavior state is stored for each frame of the video to allow for in depth analysis. Total time immobile and latency to immobility are calculated in the app, but the raw fame-wise state data can also be saved to excel for further analysis.
        This app is ideal for manual scoring of behaviors in preparation for training automated bahavior detection using machine learning and DeepLabCut.
        
        Manually intalling dependencies:
        
        Pip install opencv-python
        Conda install qtpy
        Conda install qtpygraph
        
        Download fst_dist3.py and fsw.py in the same folder
        
        Run in IDE or launch in terminal with:
