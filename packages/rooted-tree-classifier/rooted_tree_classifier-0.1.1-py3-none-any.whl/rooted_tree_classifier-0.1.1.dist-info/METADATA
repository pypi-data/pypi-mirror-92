## Description

This folder contains two programs that partially a round complexity of homogenous LCL problem on (binary) trees.  

- log_decider
    - decides whether a problem is log(n) solvable or it is inherently harder
- log_star_decider
    - decides whether a problem is log*(n) solvable or it is inherently harder

## Usage

1. Install dependencies by `pip3 install -r requirements`.

2. Run `python3 log_decider.py` or `python3 log_star_decider.py` and on describe (on standard input) constraints of a problem.

See `tests.py` for some problem examples.
