PhreeqPy - Python Tools for PHREEQC
====================================


Introduction
------------

PhreeqPy is Open Source software and provides Python tools to work with
PHREEQC_.

Currently it provides access to the new IPhreeqc_ interface without the need to
run a COM server and therefore also works on non-Windows systems.
IPhreeqc is described in more detail in this publication_.

`Please let us know`_ what you do with PhreeqPy or if things do not work
as expected. There is a
`mailing list for PhreeqPy <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phreeqpy-users>`_.
Please subscribe_ to get your questions about PhreeqPy answered.

Installation
------------

**Pythons (tested)**: Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.8, 3.7, 3.9 PyPy

**Pythons (untested but should work since using ctypes)**: IronPython, Jython 2.7

**Platforms**: Unix/Posix and Windows

**PyPI package name**: `phreeqpy <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/phreeqpy>`_


Installation with `pip`::

    pip install -U phreeqpy


You need an IPhreeqc shared libray for your operating system.
PhreeqPy comes with shared libraries for 32-bit Windows, 32-bit Linux and
64-bit Mac OS X.
There is no 64-bit Windows distributed with PhreeqPy.
Please install the `Windows COM 64-bit`_ module of IPhreeqc and use
`phreeqpy.iphreeqc.phreeqc_com as phreeqc_mod` instead of
`import phreeqpy.iphreeqc.phreeqc_dll as phreeqc_mod` as shown in the example.
If you use Anaconda or Miniconda make sure to:

    conda install pywin32

before you install PhreeqPy.

.. _`Windows COM 64-bit: https://water.usgs.gov/water-resources/software/PHREEQC/index.html

You may download an appropriate library from here:
ftp://brrftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/charlton/iphreeqc/

For example for Linux::

    wget ftp://brrftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/charlton/iphreeqc/iphreeqc-2.18.4-6386.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf iphreeqc-2.18.4-6386.tar.gz
    cd iphreeqc-2.18.4-6386
    ./configure
    make
    make check
    sudo make install


Then either use the full path to the shared libray when making an instance of
``phreeqc_dll.IPhreeqc``

.. code-block:: python

    phreeqc = phreeqpy.iphreeqc.phreeqc_dll.IPhreeqc('/full/path/to/libiphreeqc.so')


or copy the shared object into ``phreeqpy/iphreeqc`` replacing the existing
one. For example::

    sudo cp /usr/local/lib/libiphreeqc.so  /path/to/site-pacges/PhreeqPy-0.2.0-py2.7.egg/phreeqpy/iphreeqc/libiphreeqc.so.0.0.0


Benchmark Test Comparing PhreeqPy to External Processes, COM and C++

This publication demonstrates how PhreeqPy can be used for reactive transport
modeling.
