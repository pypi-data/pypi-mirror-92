PhreeqPy: Python Tools for PHREEQC
==================================

PhreeqPy provides Python tools to work with PHREEQC_.

Currently it provides access to the new IPhreeqc_ interface without the need to
run a COM server and therefore also works on non-Windows systems.
IPhreeqc is described in more detail in this publication_. This 
`publication at the conference MODFLOW and More 2011`_ demonstrates with an
example how PhreeqPy works.
