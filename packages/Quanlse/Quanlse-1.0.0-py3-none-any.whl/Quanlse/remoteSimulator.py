    """
    Given the Hamiltonian of a quantum system, this function returns the list of time-evolution unitary matrices
    using Quanlse Cloud Service.
    This function supports batch pulse simulation - users can submit a job list of multiple jobs.
    Each job is also a list, and multiple waves can be appended onto this list.
    On Quanlse Cloud Service, those waves will be added to ``ham``, and ``ham`` will be simulated;
    the result (including the time-evolution unitary matrix) will be append onto a result list corresponding
    to ``jobList``.

    :param ham: the Hamiltonian dictionary
    :param jobList: job list containing waveform lists
    :return: a list of result dictionary

    **Example: Scan the amplitudes**

    In this example, ``jobs`` is the list of jobs; ``jobWaves`` is the list of waves for each job. We use
    ``Quanlse.Utils.Waveforms.makeWaveData()`` to generate wave data, and append the wave data
    dictionary onto ``jobWaves``.

    .. code-block:: python

            jobs = []
            for amp in ampList:

                jobWaves = []

                # Add Gaussian wave of X control on the qubit 0
                jobWaves.append(makeWaveData(ham, "q0-ctrlx", t0=0, t=gateTime, f="gaussian", para={"a": amp}))
                jobWaves.append(makeWaveData(ham, "q1-ctrlx", t0=0, t=gateTime, f="gaussian", para={"a": amp}))

                # append this job onto the job list
                jobs.append(jobWaves)

    official website of Quantum Hub: http://quantum-hub.baidu.com.
