Description
===========

A NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway, which represents a router
that lets instances without public IPs contact the public internet
without exposing the instance to inbound internet traffic. For more
information, see NAT Gateway.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you are not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you
are an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
see Getting Started with Policies.

**Warning:** Oracle recommends that you avoid using any confidential
information when you supply string values using the API.
