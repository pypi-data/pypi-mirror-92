Overview
--------

edx-when is designed to be the central source of dates for the LMS.
This repository is deployed to PyPI and designed to be installed and imported by an installation of edx-platform.
As part of being integrated into edx-platform, edx-when shares the **same** database as the rest of the platform.
It is written to by Studio when a Course is published
(via https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/blob/master/openedx/core/djangoapps/course_date_signals/handlers.py)
and then the LMS reads from it in several locations.
This repo contains start, end, and due dates for Courses and offers the
functionality to have both absolute and relative dates.

Unreleased
~~~~~~~~~~

[2.0.0] - 2021-01-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dropped python3.5 support.

[1.3.2] - 2021-01-15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't warn about missing schedules for relative dates.
It happens for legitimate reasons, and the layer above can check instead.

[1.3.1] - 2020-11-19
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated travis badge in README.rst to point to travis-ci.com instead of travis-ci.org


[1.3.0] - 2020-07-16
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django 3.x deprecation warnings are fixed

[1.2.9] - 2020-06-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't return due dates for enrollments originally created too close to the
course end to allow for finishing the course in time.

[1.2.8] - 2020-06-17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't return due dates for enrollments created after course end

[1.2.4] - 2020-06-01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updates function in API for finding learners with a specific Schedule
that has an assignment on a given day, to also be inclusive of absolute
date schedules (everyone active in the course without an override).

[1.2.3] - 2020-04-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Dropped support for Django versions below 2.2
* Added support for python 3.8

[1.1.4] - 2019-03-30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Drop the active index from ContentDate. It has low cardinality and Aurora was
  doing a lot of extra work to try to do an intersect query with that and
  the course_id index, when using the latter by itself would be far more
  efficient.


[1.1.3] - 2019-03-25
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Use memcache to cache ContentDate information in get_dates_for_course


[0.1.0] - 2019-03-04
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added
_____

* First release on PyPI.
