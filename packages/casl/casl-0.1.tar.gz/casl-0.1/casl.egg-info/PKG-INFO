Description: # NAME

        # WHAT IS CASL?
        
        *casl* is simple implementation of CASL assembler and COMET simulator written
        in Python.  The CASL assembler and the COMET simulator are designed for users
        to study principle operations of computers.  In particular, CASL and COMET are
        used in a qualifying examination called as Japan Information-Technology
        Engineers Examination so that these programs would be of value for people who
        would like to acquire this qualification.
        
        Since both the CASL assembler and the COMET simulator are written only in
        Python, these should work on almost all operating system
        including UNIX flavors, Windows, and macOS.
