Hi , I am Chayan and I have created this simple libary that can calculate numbers . Hope this libary will help you

How to use it :
for adding - print(add(number1,number2))
for subtract - print(subtract(number1,number2))
for multiply - print(multiply(number1, number2))
for divide - print(number1, number2)
