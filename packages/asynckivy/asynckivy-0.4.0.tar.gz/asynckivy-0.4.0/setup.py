Actually, I started developing this library just for learning how async/await works so it *was* initially `reinventing the wheel`.\n\nBut after playing with Trio and Kivy for a while, I noticed that Trio is not suitable for the situation where fast reactions are required e.g. touch events. The same is true of asyncio. You can see why by running `examples/misc/why_xxx_is_not_suitable_for_handling_touch_events.py`, and masshing a mouse button. You\'ll see sometimes the printed `up` and `down` aren\'t paired. You\'ll see the printed coordinates aren\'t relative to the `RelativeLayout` even though the `target` belongs to it.\n\nThe cause of those problems is that calling `trio.Event.set()` / `asyncio.Event.set()` doesn\'t *immediately* resume the tasks that are waiting for the `Event` to be set. It just schedules the tasks to resume.\nSame thing can be said to `nursery.start_soon()` and `asyncio.create_task()`. Yes, Trio has `nursery.start()`, which immediately starts a task, but it\'s an async-function so it cannot be called from synchronous code, which means it\'s no use here.\n\nTrio and asyncio are async **I/O** libraries after all. They probably don\'t need the functionality that immediately resumes/starts tasks, which is necessary for Kivy\'s touch handling.\nThier core design may not be suitable for GUI in the first place.\nThat\'s why I\'m still developing this `asynckivy` library to this day.\n\n[asyncio]:https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html\n[trio]:https://trio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\n[reinventing]:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel\n',
