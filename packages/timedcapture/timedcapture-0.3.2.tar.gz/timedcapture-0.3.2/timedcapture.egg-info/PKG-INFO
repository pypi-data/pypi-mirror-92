Description: # timedcapture
        
        a cython-based module to achieve on-time video capture through V4L2.
        
        For a general usage, refer to [USAGE](https://github.com/gwappa/python-timedcapture/blob/master/USAGE.md).
        
        ## Prerequisites
        
        **IMPORTANT NOTE**: the current implementation only allows 16-bit grayscale acquisition.
        **IMPORTANT NOTE**: there is no functionality that controls the frame rate. Frame-capture timings must be controlled elsewhere, either using software or hardware timers.
        
        - The library is tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, but it is supposed to work on any Linux environment that runs V4L2.
        - Please note that the library is optimized for cameras from [ImagingSource](https://www.theimagingsource.com/).
          By using devices from other manufacturers, you will not have control over functionalities such as:
          - 1 microsecond-order exposure control (V4L2 only allows the order of 10 microseconds)
          - auto-gain/manual-gain switch (the gain control will be totally manual- or auto-controlled)
          - trigger modes (by default, only the free-running mode will be allowed)
          - "strobe" output
          These settings must be configured elsewhere.
        
        ## Installation
        
        For the time being, we only provide the source distribution on PyPI.
        You will need a working Cython and Numpy combination **pre-installed**.
        
        ```bash
        $ pip install numpy>=1.19 cython>=0.29 # or: "conda install numpy cython", in case you use Anaconda
        $ pip install timedcapture
        ```
