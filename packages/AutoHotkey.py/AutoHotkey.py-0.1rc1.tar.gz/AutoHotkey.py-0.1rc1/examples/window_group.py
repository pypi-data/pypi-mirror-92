"""Manage window groups.

When two or more windows are grouped it means that when one of them gets
activated, the others are brought to the front. For example, you can group an
editor window and a documentation window. Next time you activate the editor
window, the documentation window is brought up so you can see both windows.
Conversely, when you activate the documentation window, the editor is brought
up.

To add window to the group, activate it and press Apps+G. To remove the window
from the group, activate it and press Apps+G again. When the window is closed,
it's automatically removed from the group. If after removing the window there's
only one window left in the group, the group is dissolved.
