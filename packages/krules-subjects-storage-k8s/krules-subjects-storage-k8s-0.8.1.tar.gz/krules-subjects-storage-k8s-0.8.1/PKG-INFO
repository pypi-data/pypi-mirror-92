Description: # krules-subjects-k8s-storage
        
        KRules is a rules engine primarily intended to run on Kubernetes. 
        However the core can be easily used even in different contexts. 
        In addition to the core part, you need at least one subject implementation.
        
        This module implements the storage component of the subjects-store based on kubernetes itself
        
        This is not intended for general use but to specifically map kubernetes resources as subjects
        
        KRules is a project in progress and we are working hard on a first widely usable version.
        
        Exhaustive documentation has not yet been released.
        
        If you are interested in getting an idea of the project you can meanwhile take a look at the [overview](https://github.com/airspot-dev/krules-doc/blob/master/OVERVIEW.md) document in which the general concepts are explained.
