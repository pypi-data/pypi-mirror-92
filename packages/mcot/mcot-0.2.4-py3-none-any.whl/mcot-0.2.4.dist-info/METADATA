The personal utilities and libraries from Michiel Cottaar.

This code contains many different packages which can either be installed separately using `pip install mcot.<package>` or as one whole `pip install mcot`.

Command line scripts
--------------------

Command line scripts are all available through a single executable: `mcot` . 
This executable will be installed irrespective of the package you install (it is part of `mcot.utils`, which is required by all other packages).
You can run a specific script using:

.. code-block :: sh

    mcot $SCRIPTNAME

Many scripts are grouped together, in which case they can be called as:

.. code-block :: sh

    mcot $GROUP $SCRIPTNAME

To list the installed scripts just type:

.. code-block :: sh

    mcot

Developer's notes
-----------------
All packages are managed as a single monorepo available at https://git.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ndcn0236/mcot.
Testing and packaging is handled through the pants build system https://www.pantsbuild.org/.
First make sure to be in the top-level directory and then run the following to test:

.. code-block :: sh

    ./pants test ::

or to build the packages:

.. code-block :: sh

    ./pants package ::

To bump the version number of a package run:

.. code-block :: sh

    ./bump_project.sh <package> <part>

where <part> is one of "major", "minor", or "patch". This will bump the version of both the package and the `mcot` complete package, which can then be uploaded using twine.

Adding a new package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a new directory in "src/mcot"
2. Add a README.rst and VERSION file with a description and the version number.
3. Use `mcot.utils.build.load_info` in __init__.py to import the README and version number

    .. code-block :: python

        from mcot.utils.build import load_info
        __doc__, __version__ = load_info(__name__) 
        del load_info

4. Copy an existing .bumpversion.cfg from another directory and update the current version number
5. Copy a BUILD script from another package (e.g., `mcot.surface`) and adjust the contents accordingly
6. Copy BUILD script to test directory from test directory of another project (e.g., "src/mcot/surface/tests")
7. Add the package to the BUILD script in the top-level directory if and only if this package will be uploaded to pypi
8. Add package requirements to "requirements.txt"
9. Add the package to documentation in doc/index.rst
10. Run the tests for this package

    .. code-block :: sh

        ./pants test src/mcot/<package name>/tests/:

11. Test the package build:

    .. code-block :: sh

        ./pants package src/mcot/<package name>:

11. Build the documentation

    .. code-block :: sh

        python doc/publish.py
