## [0.6]

### [0.6.0] - 2020-01-12

0.6.0 include a single fix to avoid breaking SemVer 2 validity, which is
essential for Helm 3 compatibility. The change is to prefix build number and
build hash with `n` and `h` respectively. The reason for doing this is that it
ensures we don't break the SemVer 2 assumption to not have a numerical segment
starting with zero, like for example `0.1.0-002.sdfg234` has with its `002`.
Helm 3 enforce this, while Helm 2 doesn't.

#### Fixes

- Prefix build info with n and h to ensure SemVer 2 validity, in order to solve Helm 3 compatibility [#87](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/87) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio))

## [0.5]

### [0.5.0] - 2019-12-01

#### Added

- Add --force-build / --force-push, and don't let --tag imply it [#70](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/70) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio))
- `helm dependency update` is now run as part of publishing, this ensures we honor requirements.yaml before publishing a chart [#69](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/69) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio))

#### Fixes

- Fix regression to make a chart's `images` configuration optional again [#77](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/77) ([@jacobtomlinson](https://github.com/jacobtomlinson))
- Fix regarding image paths as part of setting up thorough testing with PyTest [#68](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/68) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio))

#### Maintenance

- Setup CD of PyPI releases on git tag pushes [#83](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/83) ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio))
- Adopt bump2version for automating version bumps [#74](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/74) ([@minrk](https://github.com/minrk))

## [0.4]

### [0.4.3] - 2019-10-29 (Breaking changes)

0.4.3 contains important bug fixes for versions `0.4.0` to `0.4.2`. A big bug
fixed was that charts published using `--publish-chart` replaced previous charts
in the helm chart repositories' `index.yaml` file that only differed by a SemVer
2 compliant build suffix like `+001.asdf123`. The bugfixes introduced in this
release avoid this issue, caused by a bug in helm, by using a build suffix of
`.001.asdf123` instead - a breaking change.

Example versions to expect in this release and onwards are given below where
some commits were made in between git tagged (`0.1.0` and `0.2.0-beta.1`)
commits.

```
# without --long
0.1.0
0.1.0-002.sdfg234
0.2.0-beta.1
0.2.0-beta.1.003.asdf123

# with --long
0.1.0-000.qwer123
0.1.0-002.sdfg234
0.2.0-beta.1.000.wert234
0.2.0-beta.1.003.asdf123
```

- Fix latest tagged commit
  [#66](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/66)
  ([@minrk](https://github.com/minrk))
- Fix bugs: index merge, image tag, g prefix, ignored tags
  [#64](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/64)
  ([@consideRatio](https://github.com/consideRatio))
- Support `valuesPath` pointing to a single `image:tag` string in addition to a
  dict with separate `repository` and `tag` keys
  [#63](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/63)
  ([@minrk](https://github.com/minrk)).
- Support lists in `valuesPath` by using integer indices
  [#65](https://github.com/jupyterhub/chartpress/pull/65)
  ([@minrk](https://github.com/minrk)), e.g. `section.list.1.image` for the
  yaml:
  ```yaml
  section:
    list:
      - first: item
        image: "not set"
      - second: item
        image: "image:tag"  #  <--sets this here
  ```
