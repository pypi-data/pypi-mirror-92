Description: 
        *minds* is a Python toolkit, which can be used for computing minimum size
        decisions sets, i.e. unordered sets of *if-then* rules. The toolkit represents
        a set of pure Python modules, which can be used in a Python script in the
        standard way through the provided API. Additionally, it contains an executable
        ``mds.py``, which can be applied for constructing a smallest size decision set
        for a training dataset in CSV.
