        ### Recent Changes
         2020-10: ver. 39.0
         
         * The 'docgen' command creates a single README and updated the README to include information on App Hosts.
         
         * Added the Resilient platform version to the customize.py template.
         
         * The 'package' command replaces tags on Resilient objects in export.res instead of extending them.
         
         * Added environmental variable RES_SDK_DEV.
         
         * Added '--set-version' argument to the dev command.
         
         * Added 'display_name' attribute to the setup.py file.
         
         * The 'codegen', 'codegen --reload' and 'dev --set-version' commands create a /util/data/export.res file that contains the import definition which was previously base64 encoded text in customize.py.
         
         * Before running the 'codegen --reload' on packages created with Resilient SDK < 39.0.0, ensure the MANIFEST.in file includes the line: recursive-include <package_name>/util *
         
         * The 'codegen' and 'package' commands return errors if the package name contains uppercase characters.
         
         * Added a 'clone' command to clone an Action Object.

        ## Overview
        
        The IBM Resilient SDK provides the tools and infrastructure you need to develop Resilient Apps, which you can then post on [App Exchange](https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/hub/?br=Resilient).
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install the IBM Resilient SDK, simply execute the following command:
        
        ```
        $ pip install resilient-sdk
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### `codegen:`
        Generate boilerplate code to start developing an app.
        ```
        $ resilient-sdk codegen -p <name_of_package> -m 'fn_custom_md' --rule 'Rule One' 'Rule Two'
        ```
        
        ### `docgen:`
        Generate documentation for an app.
        ```
        $ resilient-sdk docgen -p <path_to_package>
        ```
        
        ### `extract:`
        Extract data in order to publish a .res file.
        ```
        $ resilient-sdk extract -m 'fn_custom_md' --rule 'Rule One' 'Rule Two'
        ```
        
        ### `package:`
        Package an integration into a Resilient app.
        ```
        $ resilient-sdk package -p <path_to_directory> --display-name "My Custom app"
        ```
        
        ### `clone:`
        Duplicate an existing Action related object (Function, Rule, Script, Message Destination, Workflow) with a new api or display name
        ```
        $ resilient-sdk clone --workflow <workflow_to_be_cloned> <new_workflow_name>
        ```
        ```
        $ resilient-sdk clone --workflow <workflow_to_be_cloned> <new_workflow_name> --changetype artifact
        ```
        
        ## Supported Python Versions
        
        Python 2.7+ and Python 3.6+
        
        
        ## Documentation
        For details on the Resilient SDK commands, use the `-h` option on the command line. For example, `resilient-sdk -h` and `resilient-sdk codegen -h`.
        
        The Resilient App Developer's Guide provides information on using the Resilient SDK to develop and package apps. The guide is available on the IBM Knowledge Center at [ibm.biz/resilient-docs](https://ibm.biz/resilient-docs). On this web page, select your Resilient platform version. On the follow-on page, you can find the App Developer's Guide by expanding **Resilient Apps** in the Table of Contents pane.
