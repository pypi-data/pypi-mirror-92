******** SECTION A ********
------------------------------------------------------------
Release Number: 4
Release Date: 2020-04-01
Data Coverage: 2019-10-01 through 2019-12-31 (Sols 300-389)

New products have been added to these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_seed
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_table
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:document

Products have been revised in these collections:
    
* SEIS miniseed data of ELYSE and ELYHK from previous releases that have
been modified by the IPGP team since Nov 29, 2019. The following nine data 
products have been revised:

xb.elyse.17.blw.2019.207.2::2.0
xb.elyse.02.bhu.2019.208.6::2.0
xb.elyse.02.bhv.2019.208.6::2.0

xb.elyse.02.bhw.2019.233.11::2.0
xb.elyse.02.bhu.2019.233.10::2.0
xb.elyse.02.bhv.2019.233.11::2.0


Metadata

Updated metadata files were included for ELYSE and ELYSK:
dataless.xb.elyhk.2020.062.seed	
dataless.xb.elyse.2020.062.seed

Comments on metadata:

    * metadata (dataless SEED and stationXML files) of ELYSE and ELYHK
    correspond to the release 2020.062.1 . These files were
    produced by B13 software version 3.10 2019-8-28. This software version
    is now included into the stationXML (See Source element) and is always
    included into the dataless SEED Files.

    * stationXML files: converted with IRIS-DMC conversion tool version
    2.0.10 (indicated also into stationXML files), but these files do not
    validate with IRIS-DMC validator 1.5.9.5.

    * the latest modifications on SP instrumental responses are not included
    in this version

Comments:

In PDS labels for SEIS products in releases 1a, 1b, and 2 (sols 181 
and earlier) the value for insight:stop_sol_number is incorrect; it 
should be 1 less than the value given. The labels will be corrected 
in a future release.

Note: no data are included for:
sols 241-256 for ELYHK
sols 242-256 for ELYSE
due to solar conjunction when SEIS was switched off. 

In PDS labels for SEIS products in releases 1a, 1b, and 2 (sols 181

should be 1 less than the value given. The labels will be corrected 
in a future release.

Release Number: 1b
Release Date: 2019-06-26
Data Coverage: 2018-11-26 through 2019-03-31 (Sols 1-122)

New products have been added to these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_seed
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_table
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:document

Products have been revised in these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_seed
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_table

Comments:
The first release of InSight data by PDS takes place
in two parts. In part A only raw data products are released. 
In part B, one month later, the calibrated versions of those products 
are released. Subsequent InSight releases are scheduled for every
three months and will include both raw and calibrated products.
For SEIS, the calibration of the raw data results in revisions to the 
transfer function specified in the metadata files. The raw data files 
are not changed; rather, revised metadata files are provided as better 
calibration information becomes available throughout the mission.

Products updated in Release 1B to have overlaps removed, replacing those 
delivered in Release 1A:

xb/continuous_waveform/elyse/2019/054/xb.elyse.05.lmu.2019.054.6.mseed

******** SECTION B ********

The following notes provide new information and outline some minor issues which
will be corrected in future releases.

A detailed description of the SEIS network codes, station codes, location IDs,
and channel IDs can be found in the Channel Naming Spreadsheet included with
this and all future releases.
filename: "INS-ST-GRDS-1500-IPGP_SEED_ChannelNaming.xlsx"


1/Timing

Issue: Metadata currently do not encode LOBT and AOBT.

Solution: SISMOC and MSDS incorporated a change request to metadata generation
process. 

Impact to Release 3: None. SEIS team requested LOBT and AOBT to be encoded in
the SEIS metadata as a means to track clock drift. Future releases will include
new header fields to encode LOBT and AOBT in the waveform headers and corresponding 
labels.


2/Metadata conversion from dataless SEED to StationXML [RESOLVED WITH RELEASE 2]

Issue: There was a problem preventing converting the most recent
dataless.XB.ELYH0.2019.087.seed and XB.ELYHK.2019.109.seed to stationXML. The
problem appeared after a new SEED version was provided by SISMOC. A change
request was initiated, but not in place in time for the first release. The
latest versions that can be converted are still valid for Release 1B:

dataless.XB.ELYH0.2019.032.seed
dataless.XB.ELYHK.2019.077.seed

Solution: SISMOC is incorporating a change request to the SEED file generation
process. Start/end times will be updated in the dataless SEED channel
descriptions, and new dataless SEED files will be produced.

Impact to Release 1B: Some miniseed files have small segments that do not have
metadata in dataless SEED. What happens is that the channel begins just after
the segment start or ends just before the segment end, as identified in the
metadata. 


3/ELYS0 and ELYSE station coordinates

There was some inconsistency in the locations (physical coordinates) reported in
the metadata for different station and channel codes for previous releases. These
fields were initially populated with the pre-landing coordinates, and then updated 
with post-landing determined coordinates. However, the update was made inconsistently
between the sensor field and the station field. This was corrected for this release.

The listed coordinates currently reflect the location of the lander:
latitude: 4.502384, longitude: 135.623447, elevation: -2613.426

After a bit more georeferencing of lander images, the team will report different 
physical coordinates for the on-deck (ELYH0 and ELYS0) vs. deployed (ELYHK and
ELYSE) configurations. This change will be indicated in future metadata and
release notes when the coordinates are available.


4/Lander activity files

Lander activity files record information on times when the lander was performing
certain functions that may show up as fluctuations in the signals recorded by
SEIS. These are xml files containing times and descriptions of the activity,
including such items as VBB calibration, centering, & leveling, SP acquisition
rate changes, lander wakeup, communication passes, arm movements, and other
similar activities. These files will be made available in a future release.


5/Events

The event "mqs2019fddj" reported in Release 1b is no longer considered a candidate
by the team and will be deleted from the final event catalog delivered at the end of
the project.

After Release 1b, the SEIS team decided not to archive separate waveform files for
events. A catalog listing event start and stop times will be included at the end
of the active mission.


6/Updated files in the time period covered by previous releases:

Replacement products are provided for 2019 Day 138  for ELYSE 03.BHU 
(vbb 1 velocity high gain science mode) and 03.BHV (vbb 2 velocity 
high gain science mode). Previous files were truncated.
IDs:
urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_table:xb.elyse.03.bhu.2019.138.24.a::1.0
urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_table:xb.elyse.03.bhv.2019.138.24.a::1.0
urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_table:xb.elyse.03.bhu.2019.138.24::1.0
urn:nasa:pds:insight_seis:data_table:xb.elyse.03.bhv.2019.138.24::1.0

These should not be considered revised files as the error was part of the
archive assembly process, not a spacecraft issue.


7/Metadata

Updated metadata files were included for ELYSE and ELYHK:
dataless.xb.elyse.2019.333.seed
dataless.xb.elyhk.2019.333.seed
