Section A of this document contains an entry for each HP3/RAD release with
general information about the contents of the release, in order from newest
to oldest.  Updates to previously released files are reported in these
entries, along with any known errata.

Section B of this file contains general notes, if any, concerning the archive

******** SECTION A ********


------------------------------------------------------------

Release Number: 4 
Release Date: 2020-04-01
Data Coverage: 2019-10-01 through 2019-12-31 (Sols 300-390)

New products have been added to these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_calibrated
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_derived
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_raw


Comments:

On of the radiometer sensors (2C, field of view 2 broadband sensor) experienced a 
significant drift of its calibration. On about sol 325 the brightness temperatures 
derived from this sensor started to progressively diverge from expected seasonal 
trends and the trends observed by the other sensors. The normal self-calibrations 
are run once per four weeks while new commands are uplinked once per week. The 
next performed self-calibration on sol 340 confirmed an increase in sensitivity. 
Following, more frequently scheduled calibrations showed that the drift continued
to increase sensitivity and reached an apparently stable state at some point after 
sol 355. The exact timeline of the drift is however not well resolved by the 
self-calibrations and we assume that the sensitivity exponentially decays to 
the new state with a half life of 18 sols, starting on sol 325.
It is possibly that better understanding of the root cause of this drift would 
lead us to modifying this timeline. This would result in an update of the 
calibrated and derived datasets in this release, however any changes will likely 
stay within the range of uncertainty provided in this release.

Release Number: 3 
Release Date: 2020-01-01
Data Coverage: 2019-07-01 through 2019-09-30 (Sols 210-299)

New products have been added to these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_calibrated
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_derived
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_raw


Comments:

Due to the conjunction the radiometer was off after sol 263. A typographical error 
in the release number 2 comments data coverage has been corrected. The table in the release 
notes for release 1A provided operation mode codes that are inconsistent with those in the raw data files.
The raw data files provide the operation mode codes as they are used by the flight software, which are:

Ops mode # | Description
-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------
0          | no operation mode, controlled by ground commands
65-66      | standard mode - not used due to technical issues
33-34      | hourly mode
97-98      | single mode
129-130    | calibration mode - only usable for science under certain conditions 
           |(Temperature calibration target = Temperature Sensorhead)
------------------------------------------------------------

Release Number: 2 
Release Date: 2019-09-26
Data Coverage: 2019-04-01 through 2019-06-30 (Sols 122-210)

New products have been added to these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_calibrated
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_derived
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_raw


Comments:

On about Sol 150 a jump in measured voltages about +4 microvolt has been 
observed in all channels of ADC-1 in the RAD Sensorhead. This offset has 
been corrected in all calibrated and derived data from sol 150 on, but 
not in the raw data.

Release Number: 1, part 2
Release Date: 2019-06-26
Data Coverage: 2018-11-26 through 2019-03-31 (Sols 1-122)

New products have been added to these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_calibrated
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_derived

Products have been revised in these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_raw


Comments:
The raw data table has been updated to extend through 2019-03-31
as well. 

For the calibrated and derived data products only those data vectors are used that
can be calibrated. That means only data with operation modes 1-7 (see table below) and 
acquired while the instrument is within 0.1 K of its target temperature setpoint are used.
Also, all data before 2018-12-11T07:30:42.598Z have been excluded because the dust cover 
was still closed. 

During ground calibration it was discovered that calibration uncertainties are larger 
than expected. The calibration coefficient also had to be updated using data gathered 
after landing on Mars, before the opening of the dust cover/calibration target.
This results in large systematic errors in the sensors using narrow 
spectral bandpasses, i.e. sensors 1A, 1C, 2A, 2B. 

The derived data products are based on the calibrated data of sensors 1B and 2C. Assumed
is a surface emissivity of 0.98 with an uncertainty of 0.02.

at the InSight Landing Site. Space Sci Rev (2018) 214:104. doi:10.1007/s11214-018-0537-y.)

The documentation (SIS) currently (2018-03-06) does not provide which of the three 
spectral filters is used in each of the six thermopile sensors. 
The spectral bandpasses are described in section 2.6.3.5 of the HP3 PDS SIS 
are given for each sensor in the following table:

 Sensor |   Spectral Filter
--------+------------------------
    1A  |   8-10µm Bandpass
    1B  |   8-14µm Bandpass
    1C  |   16-19µm Bandpass
    2A  |   16-19µm Bandpass
    2B  |   8-10µm Bandpass
    2C  |   8-14µm Bandpass

	
Raw data tables include a number indicating what operation mode was used. 
The modes are the following:

Ops mode # | Description
-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------
0          | no operation mode, controlled by ground commands
1-3        | standard mode - not used due to technical issues
4-5        | hourly mode
6-7        | single mode
8-9        | calibration mode - only usable for science under certain conditions 
           |(Temperature calibration target = Temperature Sensorhead)
	



------------------------------------------------------------


Release Number: 1, part 1
Release Date: 2019-04-22
Data Coverage: 2018-11-26 through 2019-02-28 (Sols 1-92)

New products have been added to these collections:
    urn:nasa:pds:insight_rad:data_raw
Products have been revised in these collections:
    none

Comments:
    The first release of InSight data by PDS takes place
in two parts. In Part 1 only raw data products are released. 
In Part 2, one month later, the calibrated versions of those products 
are released. Subsequent InSight releases are scheduled for every
three months and will include both raw and calibrated products.



******** SECTION B ********


The documentation (SIS) does not provide which of the three 
spectral filters is used in each of the six thermopile sensors. 
The spectral bandpasses are described in section 2.6.3.5 of the HP3 PDS SIS 
are given for each sensor in the following table:

The SIS further does not clarify what the RAD operation mode codes provided in the raw 
data files mean. This information is provided in the following table.
