Each document and data product in this bundle is described by a PDS4
label in a separate file with the same name but with the extension XML.
PDS4 labels are XML (eXtended Markup Language) files that conform to the
PDS4 Information Model XML schema at
https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/schema/released/. They are best viewed in an
XML-aware text editor, and may be used by software that can manipulate
XML documents.

For information about PDS4, see https://pds.nasa.gov/pds4/about/.
