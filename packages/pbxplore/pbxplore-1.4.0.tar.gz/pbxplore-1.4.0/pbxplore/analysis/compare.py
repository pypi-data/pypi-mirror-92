    Convert a similarity substitution matrix to a single digit distance

    This function takes a substitution matrix expressed as similarity scores,

    similar PBs, and 9 means different PBs.

    Such single digit substitution matrix is convenient to display sequences
    of substitution scores.

    ..note:

        If a substitution matrix expressed with distances is provided
        rather than a matrix expressed with similarity scores, then the
        returned matrix is expressed with similarity scores.
