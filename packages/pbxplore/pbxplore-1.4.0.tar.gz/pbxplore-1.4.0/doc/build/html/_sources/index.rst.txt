Welcome to PBxplore's documentation!
====================================

**PBxplore is a suite of tools dedicated to Protein Block analysis.**

Protein Blocks (PBs) are structural prototypes defined by
`de Brevern <http://www.dsimb.inserm.fr/~debrevern/index.php>`_ *et al* [#]_.
The 3-dimensional local structure of a protein backbone can be modelized as an 1-dimensional
sequence of PBs.
In principle, any conformation of any amino acid could be represented
by one of the sixteen available Protein Blocks.

PBxplore provides both a Python library and command-line tools (:doc:`Utilization <utilization>`).
For some features (reading trajectory, plots), PBxplore requires
some optional dependencies (:doc:`Installation <installation>`).
Basically, PBxplore can:

* **assign PBs** from either a PDB or either a molecular dynamics trajectory (:doc:`PB assignation <./notebooks/Assignement>`).
* use analysis tools to perform **statistical analysis** on PBs (:doc:`Statistics <PBstat>`).
* use analysis tools to **study protein flexibility and deformability** (:doc:`Analyzis <./notebooks/Deformability>`).
