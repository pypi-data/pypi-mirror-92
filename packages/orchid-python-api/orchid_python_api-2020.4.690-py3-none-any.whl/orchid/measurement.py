    """
    Construct a measurement.

    This function provides a "more functional" mechanism to create Measurement instances. It is more common to
    create a sequence of Measurements from a sequence of numbers and a **single** unit. By putting the `unit`
    argument first in the function arguments, it allows callers to write code similar to the following:

    > make_length_measurement = make_measurement(units.UsOilfield.LENGTH)
    > length_measurements = [make_length_measurement(l) for l in lengths]
    > # or toolz.map(make_length_measurement, lengths)

    Args:
        unit: The unit of this measurement.
        magnitude: The magnitude of the measurement.

    Returns:
        The created `Measurement` instance.
