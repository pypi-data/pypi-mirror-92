The seqreppy library was designed to provide operations related to numerical representations of genomic sequences, which includes the collection, coding and storage of genomic sequences.

The aforementioned operations are called the seqreppy kernel and, therefore, are executed by a special module, written in the C language, called SeqrepC.

In addition, Seqreppy provides ready-made routines for the graphical visualization of the coded sequences, as well as some analyzes related to the processing of genomic signals.

In addition to installing Seqreppy via PyPI, the interested user needs to compile the SeqrepC core. All instructions regarding the installation of SeqrepC can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/ednilsonlomazi/seqreppy)
