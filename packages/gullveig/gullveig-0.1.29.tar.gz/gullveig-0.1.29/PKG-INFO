        [![Gullveig](./docs/website/static/img/gullveig.png)](https://gullveig.hub256.com/docs/webui)
        
        Gullveig is a free, open-source, light-weight infrastructure and service monitoring and operations support platform.
        Gullveig offers monitoring, alerting, and insights services for servers, services and applications, as well
        as other useful administrator and operations features.
        
        Gullveig is modular and flexible, and allows for easy development of custom monitoring and reporting modules 
        that can be created using nearly any platform or programming language.
        
        Documentation is available at [gullveig.hub256.com](https://gullveig.hub256.com).

        Gullveig is actively developed and maintained, and is stable enough for production use - it is already used as primary
        or as an additional monitoring tool in production deployments, sizes ranging from a handful to a few hundreds of nodes.
