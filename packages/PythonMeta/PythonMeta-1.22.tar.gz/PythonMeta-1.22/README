About
---
This is a Meta-Analysis package. 

This module was designed to perform some Evidence-based medicine (EBM) tasks, such as:

* Combining effect measures (OR, RR, RD for count data and MD, SMD for continuous data);
* Heterogeneity test(Q/Chi-square test);
* Subgroup analysis;
* Plots drawing: forest plot, funnel plot, etc.

Statistical algorithms in this software cited from:
**Jonathan J Deeks and Julian PT Higgins, on behalf of the Statistical Methods Group of The Cochrane Collaboration. Statistical algorithms in Review Manager 5, August 2010.**

There are four functions/classes in PythonMeta package:

**Help()**(*function*): Show help information of PythonMeta.

**Data()**(*class*): Set and Load data to analysis.
* datatype (*attribute, string*): set the data type:'CATE' for CATEgorical/count/binary/dichotomous data, or 'CONT' for continuous data.
* studies (*attribute, array*): Array to store the study data.
* subgroup (*attribute, array*): Array to store the subgroup.
* nototal (*attribute, binary*): Flag of do NOT calculate the total effect.
* readfile(filename) (*method*): Read data file. 
    + Input: filename(string) (e.g. "c:\\1.txt");
