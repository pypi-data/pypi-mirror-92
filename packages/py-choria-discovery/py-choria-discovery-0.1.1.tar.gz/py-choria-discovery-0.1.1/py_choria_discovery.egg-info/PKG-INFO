        ## Overview
        
        `py-choria-discovery` contains a collection of tools for writing Choria External Discovery plugins in Python.
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install py-choria-discovery
            
        This library requires a version of Choria with external discovery support (0.19.1+).
            
        ## Implementing Discovery plugins
        
        The bare minimum steps to implement a python discovery plugin are:
        
        * Create a python file without a `.py` extension
        
        ```python
        #!/usr/bin/python3
        from choria_external.dispatcher import dispatch
        from choria_discovery import Discovery
        
        
        class MyDiscovery(Discovery):
        
            def discover(self):
                filtered_nodes = []
                
                # Retrieve your list of all available nodes
                #nodes = get_nodes()
                # Apply the filters in self.request.collective and self.request.filter
                #filtered_nodes = apply_filters()
                
                # Return the set of node names which match the filters
                self.reply.nodes = filtered_nodes
                
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
            dispatch(MyDiscovery)
        ```
        
        ## Example
        
        See [examples/static](examples/static) for a basic implementation of the node filtering and response.
                
        ## Reference
        
        ### Discovery
        
        Provides a base class for implementing External Discovery plugins
        
        Public methods:
        
        - `discover`
          Returns a boolean value to indicate whether the agent should be activated on this host.
          By default returns True and the agent is always activated. Subclasses may choose to override
          this method and deactivate themselves under appropriate conditions such as missing pre-requisites.
          
        Instance variables:
        
        - `logger`
          Contains a python logger which can be used to send log information back to choria (debug and info are sent to stdout,
          which is only displayed in verbose mode; warnings and errors are sent to stderr which are displayed always).
          The logger is set to use the `choria.plugin_name` hierarchy. By default all other logging is disabled to prevent
          pollution of the reply. This is done by setting the log level on the root logger to 100. You can re-enable
          logging by adjusting the log-level on either the root logger or a specific child if required.
        - `config`
          Contains a dict-like object which can be used to read configuration settings from a choria plugin
          configuration file (`/etc/puppetlabs/mcollective/plugin.d/agentname.cfg` by default).
