Description: # automate-insurance-pricing
        
        ## Introduction
        Library gathering a bunch of modules aiming at speeding up usual tasks dealing with data prep, visualization, profitability analysis and risk modelling in insurance field.
        
        
        # Getting Started
        
        ## 1.	Installation process
        
        To install use pip: pip install automate-insurance-pricing
        
        Alternatively, install directly from github: pip install git+https://github.com/nassmim/automate-insurance-pricing
        
        * Note: This package requires Python 3.7 and later.* 
        
        
        ## 2.	Sub modules and functions
        
        This library is composed of several modules families: 
        * data exploration
        * data preprocessing
        * profitability analysis
        * risk modelling
        * results exportation
        * other functions less specific
        
        To import all modules from the family taks abc: from automate_insurance_pricing import abc
        
        To import a specific module def from the family taks abc: from automate_insurance_pricing.abc import def
        
        To import all functions from a specific module def within the family abc : from automate_insurance_pricing.abc.def import *
        
        
        ## 3.	Software/Libraries dependencies
        
        Several libraries will be automatically installed when you install our library. Below is a non-exhaustive list of the packages that will be installed.
