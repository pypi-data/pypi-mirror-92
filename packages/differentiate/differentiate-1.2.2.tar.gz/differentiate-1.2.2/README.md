Compare multiple data sets and retrieve the unique, non-repeated elements.

Package features:

* Retrieve unique elements
* Importable
* Command line callable

## Propose/Rational
Initially, differentiate was built in conjunction with a proprietary MySQL migration toolkit in order to compare query results and that the database/table was succesfully migrated.  Differentiate has become its own project due to the wide variety of potential use cases.

## Usage
Compare two data sets or more (text files or lists/sets) and return the unique elements that are found in only one data set.  Differentiate can be called from a command line interface or imported as a package.

### Import examples
```python
# Retreive  unique values from two flat lists.
from differentiate import diff


x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

uniques = diff(x, y)
print(uniques)  # [0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7]
```

```python
# Retrieve unique values from two nested lists.
from differentiate import diff


x = [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
     [5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
     [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]]
y = [[5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
     [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
     [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]]

uniques = diff(x, y)
print(uniques)  # [[15, 16, 17, 18, 19], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]
```

### Command line example
```bash
>>> differ require1.txt require2.txt
```
