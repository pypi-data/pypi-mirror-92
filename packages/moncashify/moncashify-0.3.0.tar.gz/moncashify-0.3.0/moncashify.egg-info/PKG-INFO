        ===============
        
        Compatible with Python 3.x or 2.x
        
        
        Documentation
        ===============
        	
        
        Go to the `Official documentation <https://moncashify.readthedocs.io/en/latest>`_. 
        
        Moncashify is distributed as a Python package through PyPI and it can be installed with tools like ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install moncashify
        
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        If you’re new to Moncashify you can get started by following the tutorial `Implement Moncashify SDK In Your Python Projects <https://code9haiti.com/en/tutorials/implement-moncashify-sdk-in-your-python-projects>`_. 
        
        Once the package is installed, it is easy to import the package into your project.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           import moncashify
        
        
        
        Use the ``API()`` method to initialize the process.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           moncashify.API(client_id, secret_key, debug)
        
        
        ``client_id`` and ``secret_key`` can be found in your `Moncash administration <https://moncashbutton.digicelgroup.com/Moncash-business/>`_. The debugging setting (``debug``) will define whether you are in production or not. The default is ``True``, which means you are in development.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           moncash = moncashify.API(client_id, secret_key, debug=True)
