The AEA framework consists of several core elements, some of which are required to run an AEA and others which are optional.

The following sections discuss the use of the AEA framework, in particular its dominant usage where the framework is in charge of calling the code in custom packages (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control" target="_blank">inversion of control</a>). Whilst it is in principle possible to use parts of the framework as a library, we do not recommend it.

## The elements each AEA uses

<a href="../api/aea#aea-objects">`AEAs`</a> communicate asynchronously via `Envelopes`.

### Envelope

<img src="../assets/envelope.jpg" alt="Envelope of an AEA" class="center" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width:50%;">

An <a href="../api/mail/base#envelope-objects">`Envelope`</a> is the core object with which agents communicate. It is a vehicle for `Messages` with five attributes:

* `to`: defines the destination address.

* `sender`: defines the sender address.

* `protocol_id`: defines the id of the `Protocol`.

* `message`: is a bytes field which holds the `Message` in serialized form.

* `Optional[context]`: an optional field to specify routing information in a URI.

<a href="../api/protocols/base#message-objects">`Messages`</a>  must adhere to a `Protocol`.

### Protocol

<a href="../api/protocols/base#protocol-objects">`Protocols`</a> define agent-to-agent as well as component-to-component interactions within agents. As such, they include:

* `Messages`, which define the representation;

* serialization logic, which define how a `Message` is encoded for transport; and, optionally

* `Dialogues`, which define rules over `Message` sequences.

The framework provides one default `Protocol`, called `default` (current version `fetchai/default:0.11.0`). This `Protocol` provides a bare-bones implementation for an AEA `Protocol` which includes a <a href="../api/protocols/default/message#packages.fetchai.protocols.default.message">`DefaultMessage`</a>  class and associated <a href="../api/protocols/default/serialization#packages.fetchai.protocols.default.serialization">`DefaultSerializer`</a> and <a href="../api/protocols/default/dialogues#packages.fetchai.protocols.default.dialogues">`DefaultDialogue`</a> classes.

Additional `Protocols` - i.e. a new type of interaction - can be added as packages and generated with the <a href="../protocol-generator">protocol generator</a>. For more details on `Protocols` also read the `Protocol` guide <a href="../protocol">here</a>.

Protocol specific `Messages`, wrapped in `Envelopes`, are sent and received to other agents, agent components and services via `Connections`.

### Connection

A <a href="../api/connections/base#connection-objects">`Connection`</a> wraps an SDK or API and provides an interface to network, ledgers and other services. Where necessary, a `Connection` is responsible for translating between the framework specific `Envelope` with its contained `Message` and the external service or third-party protocol (e.g. `HTTP`).

The framework provides one default `Connection`, called `stub` (current version `fetchai/stub:0.15.0`). It implements an I/O reader and writer to send `Messages` to the agent from a local file.

Additional `Connections` can be added as packages. For more details on `Connections` also read the `Connection` guide <a href="../connection">here</a>.

An AEA can run `Connections` via a `Multiplexer`.

### Multiplexer

The <a href="../api/multiplexer#multiplexer-objects">`Multiplexer`</a> is responsible for maintaining potentially multiple `Connections`.

It maintains an <a href="../api/multiplexer#inbox-objects">`InBox`</a> and <a href="../api/multiplexer#outbox-objects">`OutBox`</a>, which are, respectively, queues for incoming and outgoing `Envelopes` from the perspective of `Skills`.

### Skill

<img src="../assets/skills.jpg" alt="Skills of an AEA" class="center" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width:50%;">

<a href="../api/skills/base#skill-objects">`Skills`</a> are the core focus of the framework's extensibility as they implement business logic to deliver economic value for the AEA. They are self-contained capabilities that AEAs can dynamically take on board, in order to expand their effectiveness in different situations.

A `Skill` encapsulates implementations of the three abstract base classes `Handler`, `Behaviour`, `Model`, and is closely related with the abstract base class `Task`:

* <a href="../api/skills/base#handler-objects">`Handler`</a>: each `Skill` has none, one or more `Handler` objects, each responsible for the registered messaging `Protocol`. Handlers implement AEAs' **reactive** behaviour. If the AEA understands the `Protocol` referenced in a received `Envelope`, the `Handler` reacts appropriately to the corresponding `Message`. Each `Handler` is responsible for only one `Protocol`.
* <a href="../api/skills/base#behaviour-objects">`Behaviour`</a>: none, one or more `Behaviours` encapsulate actions which further the AEAs goal and are initiated by internals of the AEA, rather than external events. Behaviours implement AEAs' **pro-activeness**. The framework provides a number of <a href="../api/skills/behaviours">abstract base classes</a> implementing different types of behaviours (e.g. cyclic/one-shot/finite-state-machine/etc.).
* <a href="../api/skills/base#model-objects">`Model`</a>: none, one or more `Models` that inherit from the `Model` can be accessed via the `SkillContext`.
* <a href="../api/skills/tasks#task-objects">`Task`</a>: none, one or more `Tasks` encapsulate background work internal to the AEA. `Task` differs from the other three in that it is not a part of `Skills`, but `Tasks` are declared in or from `Skills` if a packaging approach for AEA creation is used.

A `Skill` can read (parts of) the state of the the AEA (as summarised in the <a href="../api/context/base#agentcontext-objects">`AgentContext`</a>), and suggest actions to the AEA according to its specific logic. As such, more than one `Skill` could exist per `Protocol`, competing with each other in suggesting to the AEA the best course of actions to take. In technical terms this means `Skills` are horizontally arranged.

For instance, an AEA which is trading goods, could subscribe to more than one `Skill`, where each `Skill` corresponds to a different trading strategy.  The `Skills` could then read the preference and ownership state of the AEA, and independently suggest profitable transactions.

The framework places no limits on the complexity of `Skills`. They can implement simple (e.g. `if-this-then-that`) or complex (e.g. a deep learning model or reinforcement learning agent).

The framework provides one default `Skill`, called `error`. Additional `Skills` can be added as packages. For more details on `Skills` also read the `Skill` guide <a href="../skill">here</a>.

### Main loop

The main `AgentLoop` performs a series of activities while the `Agent` state is not stopped.

* `act()`: this function calls the `act()` function of all active registered Behaviours.
* `react()`: this function grabs all Envelopes waiting in the `InBox` queue and calls the `handle()` function for the Handlers currently registered against the `Protocol` of the `Envelope`.
* `update()`: this function dispatches the internal `Messages` from the decision maker (described below) to the handler in the relevant `Skill`.

We recommend you continue with the next step in the 'Getting Started' series:

### Relevant deep-dives

Most AEA development focuses on developing the `Skills` and `Protocols` necessary for an AEA to deliver against its economic objectives.

Understanding `Protocols` is core to developing your own agent. You can learn more about the `Protocols` agents use to communicate with each other and how they are created in the following section:

- <a href="../protocol">Protocols</a>

Most of an AEA developer's time is spent on `Skill` development. `Skills` are the core business logic components of an AEA. Check out the following guide to learn more:

- <a href="../skill">Skills</a>

In most cases, one of the available `Connection` packages can be used. Occasionally, you might develop your own `Connection`:
