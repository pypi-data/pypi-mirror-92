# Confirmation AW2

## Description

This skill purchases information from other agents as specified in its configuration. It acts as the confirmation AEA in Agent World 2.

This skill searches for an agent in a vicinity on the SOEF that sells the data this skill is configured to buy. Once it found some agents which match Agent World 2 criteria, it requests this data, negotiates the price, pays the proposed amount if agreement is reached, and receives the data bought.


## Behaviours

* `search`: searches for data selling service on SOEF

## Handlers

* `fipa`: handles `fipa` messages for negotiation
* `ledger_api`: handles `ledger_api` messages for payment
* `oef_search`: handles `oef_search` messages to manage the sellers it finds
* `signing`: handles `signing` messages for transaction signing by the decision maker


## Models

* `strategy`: allows the configuration of the purchasing. In particular, location and `search_radius` together determine the vicinity where the service is searched for, `search_query` specifies the query, and the remaining configuration specifies the terms of trade. Also, rules regarding Agent World 2 are enforced.
