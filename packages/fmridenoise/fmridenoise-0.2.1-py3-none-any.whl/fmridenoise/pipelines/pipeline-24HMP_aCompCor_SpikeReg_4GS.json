  "description": "Denoising strategy based on regressing out: 24HMP - 24 head motion parameters including: 3 translations, 3 rotations, their temporal derivatives, and their quadratic terms (Satterthwaite et al., 2013), aCompCor - signals extracted from 10 orthogonal principal components (PCs) obtained separately from the eroded white matter (WM; 5 PCs) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; 5 PCs) masks (Muschelli et al., 2014), SpikeReg - spike regressors based on FD and DVARS thresholds (Power et al., 2013). This denoising pipeline is complementary to the pipeline used in Functional Connectivity Toolbox (CONN, Whitfield-Gabrieli & Nieto-Castanon, 2012). Pipeline additionally includes global signal regression (GS), its temporal derivative, and quadratic terms (4GS).",
