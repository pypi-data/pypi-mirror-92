# Basic Calculator

This is my first python package. This is a very simple calculator that takes 2 numbers and can either add, subtract, multiply or divide them.

# Installation

Run the following  to install :

```python
pip install SDasBasicCalculator 
```

## Usage

```python
from SDasBasicCalculator import add_num
from SDasBasicCalculator import sub_num
from SDasBasicCalculator import mul_num
from SDasBasicCalculator import div_num
```



#### Add 2 numbers:

add_num(*num1*, *num2*)

#### Subtract2 numbers:

sub_num(*num1*, *num2*)

#### Multiply 2 numbers:

mul_num(*num1*, *num2*)

#### Divide 2 numbers:

add_num(*num1*, *num2*)

## Developing Basic Calculator
