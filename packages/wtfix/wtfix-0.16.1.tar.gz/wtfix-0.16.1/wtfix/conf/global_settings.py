# The FIX standard relies on ASCII encoding. Well-behaving FIX counter parties should use the 'Encoded' range of
# fields for providing non-ASCII data, and specify the exact encoding in the MessageEncoding (347) field.

# Using cp1252 (a.k.a ANSI) here might be the most forgiving option while still ensuring that (a) the encoding is
# ASCII-compatible and (b) code points will always be encoded into a single byte. cp1252 is latin-1 (a.k.a. iso8859-1)
# superset defined by Microsoft that adds useful symbols like curly quotes and the euro symbol. Both cp1252 and
# iso8859-1 are ASCII-compatible. If you want to enforce strict adherence to the FIX protocol, then set this to 'ascii'.
