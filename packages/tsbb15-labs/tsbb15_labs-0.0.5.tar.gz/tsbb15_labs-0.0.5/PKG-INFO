        ## Installation
        ### Setup
        Make sure you have python installed.
        Additionally we recommend using a package manager such as [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
        
        ### Easiest installation
        Run the command:
        ```terminal
        pip install tsbb15-labs
        ```
        Note that you do NOT need to clone this repo for this install.
        ### Install
        If you want to change any code (bugfixes etc). You may want to install the package in editable mode, so that changes can be easily observed.
        This can be done with the following commands:
        ```terminal
        git clone git@github.com:Parskatt/tsbb15_labs.git
        cd tsbb15_labs
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Some known issues
        ### tiff errors
        If you are using conda on windows you might get an error:
        > tempfile.tif: Cannot read TIFF header.
        
        If thats the case, uninstall libtiff (conda uninstall libtiff)
        and reinstall it. (this will also require you to reinstall pillow)
