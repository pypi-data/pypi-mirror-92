        ## Some known issues
        
        If you are using conda on windows you might get an error:
        > tempfile.tif: Cannot read TIFF header.
        
        If thats the case, uninstall libtiff (conda uninstall libtiff)
        and reinstall it. (this will also require you to reinstall pillow)
