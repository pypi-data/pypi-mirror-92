# About

Access, download and plot weather data from the following APIs:
- Darksky (https://darksky.net/dev)
- OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/api)

Both sources require an API key to get access to the data. However, when dealing with data already downloaded as files and stored locally, the API key is not necessary.

# Install

```bash
pip install weatho
```

# Quick Start

```python
from weatho import Weather, plot

# source can be 'owm' or 'darksky'
w = Weather(location=(45.77, 4.84), source='owm', api_key='xyz')

# Get raw data from the API (source-dependent)
# --------------------------------------------

w.url()    # get URL at which to downlowd data
w.fetch()  # get data as a dictionary

# By default, current data; get historical data by passing a datetime.datetime:

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pytz import timezone
tz = timezone('Europe/Paris')
date = tz.localize(datetime(2021, 1, 15, 12))  # 15 Jan. 2021 at Noon in Paris timezone

w.url(date)
w.fetch(date)

# Get and plot formatted, source-independent data
# -----------------------------------------------

w.current()   # current weather conditions
w.hourly()    # hourly data for present day, including forecast

# It is also possible to access historical data:
w.current(date)
w.hourly(date, until=date + timedelta(days=3))

# Plot hourly data:
plot(w.hourly())
```

There are also options to download the data directly as .json files in a folder and work from this data (see below).

For detailed examples, see the *Examples.ipynb* notebook (https://github.com/ovinc/weatho/blob/master/Examples.ipynb).


# Contents


## Weather class

The following methods are available from a `Weather` object:

- For raw, source-dependent data:
    - `url()` and copy-paste the link into a browser (returns url link)
    - `fetch()` to get the raw data from the internet (returns dict of data)
    - `save()` to save the raw data into a .json file
    - `load()` to get the raw data from a .json file (returns dict of data)

- For formatted, source-independent data for analysis and plotting:
    - `current()`: returns a dict of values (data at specific time)
    - `hourly()`: returns a dict of lists of values (hourly data), can be used in `plot()` directly.

- To download data from the API into local files, possibly in batch:
    - `download()`: saves API data in .json format in a folder (threaded for multiple requests at the same time).
    - `missing_days()`: checks if there are any missing files of data between specified dates in a folder.
    - `download_missing_days()`: same as above, but also downloads the missing data in the folder.

*Note:* To access data from downloaded files, use `load()` to get raw data, and `hourly(path=...)` to get formatted data.

## Plotting weather data

- `plot()`: takes formatted hourly data from `hourly()` (either using the API or downloaded files) as input.

# Notes

## Date/time and timezone information

- It is preferable to use timezone-aware datetimes when specifying dates to the `Weather` methods.

- In particular, when calling `download()` or `hourly()`, care must be taken because *DarkSky* and *OpenWeatherMap* do not manage hourly data the same way:
    - *DarkSky* generates hourly data from 00:00 to 23:59 in **local time** (of the requested location)
    - *OpenWeatherMap* uses 00:00 to 23:59 in **UTC time**

This means that with *OpenWeatherMap*, calling `hourly()` with a `datetime(2021, 1, 15)` localized in Central European Time will return data from 14/01/2021, 1:00 to 15/01/2021 00:00 (included) in local time, while doing the same thing with *DarkSky* will return data from 15/01/2021, 0:00 to 15/01/2021 23:00 (included) in local time.

Data stored in *.json* files using download() follows this pattern. For example:
- *OWM_45.77,4.84,2021-01-15.json*: data from 00:00 to 23:00 (included) on 15 Jan. 2021, **UTC Time**
- *DarkSky_45.77,4.84,2021-01-15.json*: data from 00:00 to 23:00 (included) on 15 Jan. 2021, **local Time** (of the requested location)

In conclusion, to avoid problems with hourly data (`hourly()`, `download()`, etc.):
- with *DarkSky*, localize all datetimes to the **local timezone** of the place you're requesting weather for,
- with *OpenWeatherMap*, work with **UTC timezone**.
- for other calls (e.g. `fetch()`, `current()` etc.), localize to whatever timezone is more convenient to work with (if using naÃ¯ve, local time of the computer will be used).


## Misc.

- If one gets the error `KeyError: 'hourly'`, it's likely that the data is not
downloaded correctly or inexistent. Check that the API key is correct and/or
test the download URL generated by `url()` in a browser.

- More data might be available compared to the ones in formatted data, see e.g. the raw dictionary returned by functions like `fetch()` or `load()`.

- For tests, the module `weatho.locations` stores coordinates of some cities/locations as a `coordinates` dictionary.
