To install Kobo, make sure you have Python 2.4 or greater installed.
Then run this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install


AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire "kobo" directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.4)
    /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.5)
