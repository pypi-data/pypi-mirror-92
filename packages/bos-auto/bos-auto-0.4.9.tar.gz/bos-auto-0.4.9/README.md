`bos-auto` is one of two services that are required for proper operation of Bookie Oracle Software(BOS). `bos-auto` comes with a worker and an API to receive data from a Data Proxy. The API receives this data, validates it, and
queues it for a worker to perform corresponding tasks. It
further stores these incidents via [`bos-incidents`](https://github.com/PBSA/bos-incidents) to later be able to
display them in the manual intervention(MINT) module [`bos-mint`](https://github.com/PBSA/bos-mint).
