  Our Database of Faces, (formerly 'The ORL Database of Faces'), contains a set
  of face images taken between April 1992 and April 1994 at the lab. The
  database was used in the context of a face recognition project carried out in
  collaboration with the Speech, Vision and Robotics Group of the Cambridge
  University Engineering Department.

  There are ten different images of each of 40 distinct subjects. For some
  subjects, the images were taken at different times, varying the lighting,
  facial expressions (open / closed eyes, smiling / not smiling) and facial
  details (glasses / no glasses). All the images were taken against a dark
  homogeneous background with the subjects in an upright, frontal position (with
  tolerance for some side movement). A preview image of the Database of Faces is
  available.

  The files are in PGM format, and can conveniently be viewed on UNIX (TM)
  systems using the 'xv' program. The size of each image is 92x112 pixels, with
  256 grey levels per pixel. The images are organised in 40 directories (one for
  each subject), which have names of the form sX, where X indicates the subject
  number (between 1 and 40). In each of these directories, there are ten
  different images of that subject, which have names of the form Y.pgm, where Y
  is the image number for that subject (between 1 and 10).

  The database can be retrieved from
  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/DTG/attarchive:pub/data/att_faces.tar.Z as a
  4.5Mbyte compressed tar file or from
  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/DTG/attarchive:pub/data/att_faces.zip as a
  ZIP file of similar size.

  A convenient reference to the work using the database is the paper
  Parameterisation of a stochastic model for human face identification.
