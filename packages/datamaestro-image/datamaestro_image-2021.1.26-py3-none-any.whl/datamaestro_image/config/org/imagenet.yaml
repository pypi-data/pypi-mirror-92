name: ImageNet
description: |
  **ImageNet** is an image database organized according to the
  [WordNet](http://wordnet.princeton.edu) hierarchy
  (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is
  depicted by hundreds and thousands of images. Currently we have an
  average of over five hundred images per node. We hope ImageNet will
  become a useful resource for researchers, educators, students and all of
  you who share our passion for pictures.
