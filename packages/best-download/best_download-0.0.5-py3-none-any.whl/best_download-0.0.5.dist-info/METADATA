# best-download
URL downloader supporting checkpointing and continuous checksumming.

Please note that we take over handling of SIGINT for cleaner messaging, this is reverted once downloading is complete. If you already handle SIGINT yourself please make a fork.

## Install
```bash
pip install best-download
```

## Basic Example
The following example can be found in "examples/basic_example.py". Replace the url with a local speed test server if desired.

```python
from best_download import download_file

def main():
    url = "http://speedcheck.cdn.on.net/1000meg.test"
    local_file_path = "1000meg.test"
    checksum = "cfab8f3761126268a6715f90796a68074c3f57c3af48e0101776d211e7b5139e"

    print(f"Testing download of file {url} to {local_file_path}")
    print("Please cancel half way through and re-run this example to test resuming")
    download_file(url, local_file_path, checksum)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
