    Methods
    -------
    update_series(series)
        Update the trace with the given series. Return `True` if it was changed.

    update_max_series_length(max_length)
        Update the maximum length of the series above which it will be downsampled.

    update_colour(colour)
        Update the trace colour. Return `True` if it was changed.

    update_label(label)
        Update the trace legend label. Return `True` if it was changed.

    get_label()
        Return the trace label, as it should appear in the legend.

    update_visible(visible)
        Update the trace visibility. Return `True` if it was changed.

    is_visible()
        Return `True` if the trace is set to be visible, otherwise `False`.

    get_x_min_max()
        Return the min and max x values as datetime objects.

    get_line()
        Return a copy of the trace's `Line2D` instance.

    get_step_size()
        Return the approximate index step size, in seconds.
