Description: PYFAB - Python interface to the Fabber Bayesian model fitting tool
        ==================================================================
        
        Fabber is a Bayesian model-fitting framework designed to fit nonlinear
        parameterised models to timeseries data, particularly 4D fMRI data
        such as ASL, CEST, DCE, DSC, etc.
        
        PYFAB offers a Python interface to the tool which can work with
        the command line Fabber tool, or the shared library version, 
        depending on which is installed.
        
        Fabber must be installed before use - See https://fabber_core.readthedocs.io/.
        Fabber and a selection of models will be available in the upcoming
        FSL 6.0.1 release
