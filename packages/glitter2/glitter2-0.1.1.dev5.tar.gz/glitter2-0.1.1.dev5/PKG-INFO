        -------
        
        *Development note*: The video guide is generated from metadata by `narakeet <narakeet.com/>`_ and
        hosted on `YouTube <https://matham.github.io/glitter2/guide.html>`_.
        The images and video are not included in the master branch because they are big and once included
        cannot be removed from history, resulting in a very large repo.
        
        Instead, these videos and images are stored in a docs branch. This branch can be deleted or
        re-created as needed with new videos, so we don't have to worry about large binary files in that
        branch.
