# Mokujin

Mokujin (v2.0) is a discord bot that fetches Tekken 7 framedata.  
It uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) v1.3.4+ and is updated to use Python 3.6+

The bot now has all the functionalities currently planned and it seems to work well and is somewhat stable. Currently, the data the bot uses is being updated to season 3 any further update will be added either on request or when we see a mistake.

Framedata acquired from RBNorway, geppopotamus and community


## If you want to use this:

Clone this to a linux server that has Python 3.6.0+ and install the dependencies with .
```py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need your own discord bot ([instruction](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)) and have the tokens in the`src/resources/config.json`. You can add a feedback channel there also.


The executable is `src/mokujin.py`.

Commands
```
!character move        -    get frame data of a move from a character
!auto-delete seconds   -    change the duration of the bot waiting until he deletes the message in this channel
!last-updates          -    get the messages of some latest updates
?feedback message      -    send message to the author   
```
