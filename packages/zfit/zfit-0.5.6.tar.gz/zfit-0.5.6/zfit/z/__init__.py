"""
z is a zfit TensorFlow version, that wraps TF while adding some conveniences, basically using a different
default dtype (`zfit.ztypes`). In addition, it expands TensorFlow by adding a few convenient functions
helping to deal with `NaN`s and similar.

Some function are already wrapped, others are not. Best practice is to use `z` whenever possible and
`tf` for the rest.
