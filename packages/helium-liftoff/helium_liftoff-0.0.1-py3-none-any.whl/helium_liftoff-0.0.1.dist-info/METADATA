# Liftoff
Liftoff is a set of command line tools for creating local development projects and resources.

## Pre-Release
Liftoff is currently in pre-release, and does not include any official support. Use this tool with caution, and report
any error messages or bugs to [developers@heliumservices.com](mailto:developers@heliumservices.com).

## How it Works
Under the hood, liftoff uses a selection of docker containers to run all of the services necessary to power your web
application locally. Before using liftoff, ensure that you have Docker installed on your system.

Liftoff includes the following service containers:
- PostgreSQL (database)
- MySQL (database)
- Adminer (web-based database client tool)
- Mailhog (fake smtp server for local email testing, includes web-based inbox)
- PHP 7.4 (interpreter for NGINX)
- PHP 8.0 (interpreter for NGINX)
- NGINX (local web server)

These containers are shared between all of your local development projects, rather than creating new instances for each
new project. For each project that you configure with liftoff, liftoff creates a `.liftoff` directory which includes 
all of the configuration files necessary to serve your project in the shared containers.

Note that the `.liftoff` configuration directory should be included in your project source control, while select files
in that directory will be automatically added to your `.gitignore` file.

## Usage
### Liftoff Services
To start liftoff services:
```
liftoff start
```

To stop liftoff services:
```
liftoff stop
```

To restart liftoff services:
```
liftoff restart
```

### Configuring a New Liftoff Project
To configure liftoff for a new project:
```
cd /your/project/directory
liftoff init
```

Then follow the question prompts to configure your project.

Note that any questions that display numbered multiple choice options, you must enter the number of your answer, not the
text.

### Configuring an Existing Liftoff Project
For projects which have been previously initialized with Liftoff, but need to be configured for your system:
```
cd /your/project/directory
liftoff build
```

This is for projects which have an existing `.liftoff` configuration directory, but are new to your system, such as
projects which were configured on another developer's system, and you are now cloning the project on your own system.

Alternatively, if you have already configured a project with liftoff, but you relocate the project directory on your
system, you should run this command.
