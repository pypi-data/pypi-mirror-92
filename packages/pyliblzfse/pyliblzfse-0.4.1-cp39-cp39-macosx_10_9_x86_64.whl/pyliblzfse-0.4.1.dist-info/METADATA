Overview
========

pyliblzfse is a Python (https://www.python.org/) module that provides LZFSE 
and LZVN compression and decompression through the reference implementation 
provided by Apple (https://github.com/lzfse/lzfse).

Installation
============

  pip3 install pyliblzfse

If you are using python 3.7 or higher, you don't need a dev environment to
install on macOS or Windows.

Building
========

  $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/ydkhatri/pyliblzfse
  $ python setup.py build

Usage
=====

  import liblzfse
  try:
    decrypted_data = liblzfse.decompress(encrypted_data)
  except liblzfse.error:
    print('liblzfse had an error!')

The library expects encrypted_data to be of the form b'bvx*......bvx$'.

Notes
=====

This is a fork of pylzfse project, which incorporates certain improvements and
provides python wheel builds (for 3.7+) so end users do not need to compile it.
