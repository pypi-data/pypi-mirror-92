Django Evolution is primarily developed and maintained by:

* Christian Hammond <christian@beanbaginc.com>,
  Beanbag, Inc. <https://beanbaginc.com>


Prior to April 2010, Django Evolution was developed and maintained by:

* Ben Khoo <khoobks@westnet.com.au>
* Russell Keith-Magee <russell@keith-magee.com>

Ben and Russell were the original developers, building Django Evolution as a
part-time project long before there were any other solutions for schema
migration for Django. Russell is a core developer of Django itself, and an
emeritus contributor.
