        ReproMan aims to simplify creation and management of computing
        environments in Neuroimaging. While concentrating on Neuroimaging
        use-cases, it is by no means is limited to this field of science and
        tools will find utility in other fields as well.
        
        Status
        ======
        
        ReproMan is under rapid development. While the code base is still
        growing the focus is increasingly shifting towards robust and safe
        operation with a sensible API. There has been no major public release
        yet, as organization and configuration are still subject of considerable
        reorganization and standardization.
        
        See `CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ if you are interested in
        internals and/or contributing to the project.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        ReproMan requires Python 3 (>= 3.6).
        
        Debian-based systems
        --------------------
        
        On Debian-based systems we recommend to enable
        `NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net>`__ from which we will soon
        provide recent releases of ReproMan (as soon as there is something to
        release). We will also provide backports of all necessary packages from
        that repository.
        
        Other Linux’es, OSX (Windows yet TODO) via pip
        ----------------------------------------------
        
        By default, installation via pip installs core functionality of reproman
        allowing for managing datasets etc. Additional installation schemes are
        available, so you could provide enhanced installation via
        ``pip install reproman[SCHEME]`` where ``SCHEME`` could be
        
        -  tests to also install dependencies used by unit-tests battery of the
           reproman
        -  full to install all of possible dependencies.
        
        For installation through ``pip`` you would need some external
        dependencies not shipped from it (e.g. ``docker``, ``singularity``,
        etc.) for which please refer to the next section.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        Our ``setup.py`` and corresponding packaging describes all necessary
        dependencies. On Debian-based systems we recommend to enable
        `NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net>`__ since we use it to provide
        backports of recent fixed external modules we depend upon. Additionally,
        if you would like to develop and run our tests battery see
        `CONTRIBUTING.md <CONTRIBUTING.md>`__ regarding additional dependencies.
        
        Later we will provide bundled installations of ReproMan across popular
        platforms.

        It is in a beta stage – majority of the functionality is usable but
        Documentation and API enhancements is WiP to make it better. Please do
        not be shy of filing an issue or a pull request. See
