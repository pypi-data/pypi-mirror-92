Correlation map
===============

Correlation Map have been published Nature Methods by D. Franke et al. (doi: 10.1038/nmeth.3358).
They allow to assess if two saxs curves are the same or not, without needing proper statisitcal error.

The idea is to measure the longest region where one curve is above the other and to compare it with 
the total length of the curve.

The staticial probablity is derived from: Mark F. Schilling, The College Mathematics Journal, Vol. 21, No. 3, (1990), pp. 196-207
