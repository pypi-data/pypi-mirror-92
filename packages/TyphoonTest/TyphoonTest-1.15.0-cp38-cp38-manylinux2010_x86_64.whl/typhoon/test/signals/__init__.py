def find(signal, region, value, from_region=None, during=None, alias=None):
    """
    Like the function typhoon.test.signals.find_all, it finds the desired characteristic on the signal. The difference
    is that find function looks only for the first occurrence of described behaviour, while find_all function returns the
    list of all moments where that condition is met.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : pandas.Series
        Signal to be tested for.
    region : string
        Can be "at", "outside", "above" or "below". The option "outside" means "above" or "below".
    value : float or tuple
        Defines the region as a single number or range.
    from_region : string
        Defines which region the signal should be prior to the desired region. Use this to detect transitions.
    during : tuple
        Time period (as a range) to be considered for analysis.
    alias : string
        Custom alias for the returned time.

    Returns
    -------
    result : Timedelta
        Time of detected behavior

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If the desired characteristic could not be detected.

    Examples
    --------
    First moment when Power is inside the range. Detects even if signal already starts in the range.

    >>> t = find(capture["P"], region="at", value=(900,1000))

    Almost same as before but require the signal to be outside the range prior entering it. Detects the transition to the range from above or below

        Manually specifies initial value to consider (instead of the first signal value)
    final_value_override: float
        Manually specifies final value to consider (instead of the last signal value)
    evaluate_from_time : float
        Defines the starting time to evaluate the step in seconds

    Returns

    StepInfo
        Contains the characteristics of the signal.
