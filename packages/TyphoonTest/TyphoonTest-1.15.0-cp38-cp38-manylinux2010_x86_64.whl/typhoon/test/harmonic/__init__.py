def thd(signal, fundamental, max_harmonic, during=None, mode="multiple_harmonics_only"):
    """Calculates signal THD

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : Series
        A Pandas Series with the signal the THD value is to be calculated.
    fundamental : int
        Fundamental frequency of the signal
    max_harmonic : int
        Maximum harmonic (with respect to fundamental) to be taken into consideration in the calculation.
    during : 2-element tuple of float/int or Timedelta
        Period of signal to consider for the calculation.
    mode: string - default is 'multiple_harmonics_only'
        Selects one of three possible modes of calculation:
        - 'multiple_harmonics_only' - only harmonics which are divisible with fundamental are taken into consideration
        - 'with_interharmonics' - all harmonics bigger than fundamental are taken into consideration
        - 'all_frequencies' - all frequencies, including subharmonics are included in the calculation

    Returns
    -------
    thd : float
        Calculated THD value.

    Note
    ----
        All three calculation modes are based on fast fourier transform; this means that length of the signal which is
        taken into calculation should be chosen carefully, because this is the parameter which defines step between
        detected frequencies. consequently, if needed frequency step is 10Hz, signal should be captured(or sliced
        with during argument) to have length of 0.1s(1/10).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from typhoon.test.signals import pandas_sine
    >>> from typhoon.test.harmonic import thd

    >>> # create 50 Hz sinusoidal signal - fundamental and add third harmonic
    >>> serie = signals.pandas_sine(1, 50, 1, 1e-6)
    >>> serie += signals.pandas_sine(0.5, 150, 1, 1e-6)
    >>> # add interharmonic
    >>> serie += signals.pandas_sine(1, 125, 1, 1e-6)
    >>> # add two subharmonics
    >>> serie += signals.pandas_sine(1, 10, 1, 1e-6)
    >>> serie += signals.pandas_sine(1, 30, 1, 1e-6)

    >>> # calculate thd with multiple harmonics only
    >>> result = thd(serie, fundamental=50, max_harmonic=10)
    >>> print(result) # prints 0.5

    >>> # calculate thd with interharmonics included
    >>> result = thd(serie, fundamental=50, max_harmonic=10, mode="with_interharmonics")
    >>> print(result) # 1 over sqrt(2)

    >>> # calculate thd with all frequencies included
    >>> result = thd(serie, fundamental=50, max_harmonic=10, mode="all_frequencies")
    >>> print(result) # prints 1

    >>> thd = harmonic.thd(serie, 60, 10)
