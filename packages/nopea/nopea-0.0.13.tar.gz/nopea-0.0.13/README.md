# Nopea
(Version 0.0.13)

---
## Purpose
Provides an ORM for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite.

## Usage

To use the power of Nopea you need to set up an adaptor and let your classed inherit from nopea.DbObject.

### Setting up Adaptor and Connection
```python
from nopea.dbobject import DbObject
from nopea.adaptors.sqlite import SQLiteAdaptor

DbObject = DbObject
DbObject.adaptor = SQLiteAdaptor('nopea.db')
```

### Creating a subclass
```python
class User(DbObject):
    name = nopea.CharField(max_length=25)
    password = nopea.CharField(max_length=50)
    describtion = nopea.TextField()
    registered = nopea.DateField()
    logins = nopea.IntegerField()
    active = nopea.BooleanField(default=True)
```

> Users automatically get an additional id field which is an instance of `nopea.fields.PkField`.

### Instance methods:
```python
instance.save()
# Simply saves the object. If it is new, it will be created, if it already exists, it will be updated. Depending on whether the instance has an id != None or not.

instance.delete()
# The instance will be delete from the removed from the database. The instance will not be deleted and keep it's original id.

```

### Class methods
```python
User.create_table()
# Function to create tables.
# The class which calls this function will get a table in the database.
```

### Manager operations:
The class provides an interface to create objects: The objects manager.
```python
User.objects.all()
# Returns all objects, unordered

User.objects.get(key=value)
# E.g.: User.objects.get(id=2) Returns one object

User.objects.filter(key=value)
# E.g.: User.objects.filter(active=True) Returns a list of
# objects (like `get` but returns more than one).

# key__lt, key__lte, key__gte and key__gt can be used to limit
# the results. lte means 'lower than equal',
# lt means 'lower than', gte means 'greater than equal' and
# gt means 'greater than'

# E.g. "logins__lt=10". This will return all users with less
# than 10 logins.

# The filters can be combined:

User.objects.filter(logins__gte=10, logins__lte=50)

User.objects.exclude(key=value)
# Returns all results where the the value of the row does not match.

User.objects.create()
# Used to create objects of the calling class.
# Takes fieldnames as kwargs. E.g.

User.objects.create(name='Christian')
# returns the just created object.

User.objects.order_by('name')
# Returns a list of matching object. Can be used with a leading - to
# reverse the order.

User.objects.count()
# Returns the number of mathing rows.
```

### DbObject class methods

```python
DbObject.raw(query, args)
# The builtin SQL injection function.
# It simply executes queries and can be used with arguments.
# It always returns what it fetches. Use it wisely.

DbObject.raw(
    "INSERT INTO user (name, description)
     VALUES (?, ?)", 'Christian', 'Nopea developer.'
    )
```
