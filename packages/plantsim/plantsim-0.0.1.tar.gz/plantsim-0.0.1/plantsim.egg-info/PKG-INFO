Description: # Python Package for communication with Siemens Tecnomatix Plant Simulation
        
        This package enables the communication with the simulation software product "Tecnomatix Plant Simulation" by
        Siemens. It speaks to PlantSim via the COM interface from within Python and includes useful mappings for
        some more complex PlantSim data types like tables.
        
        
        ## Example
        
        ```python
        from plantsim.plantsim import Plantsim
        from plantsim.table import Table
        
        plantsim = Plantsim(version='15.2', license_type='Research')
        plantsim.load_model('model.spp')
        plantsim.set_path_context('.Context.In.Your.Model')
        table = Table(plantsim, 'TableName')
        print(table) 
        ```
        
        
        ## Setup
        
        ### Requirements
        
        You need a working version of Tecnomatix Plant Simulation installed on your system to be able to use this package.
        
        
        ### System settings
        
        If you have a NVIDIA 3D graphics card installed, make sure to select it as the default in the "NVIDIA Control Panel".
        Otherwise when loading a model into Plant Simulation, you will get an information window that you need to manually
        click every time.
