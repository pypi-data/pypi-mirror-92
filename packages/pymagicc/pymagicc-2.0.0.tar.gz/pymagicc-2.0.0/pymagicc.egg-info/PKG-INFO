Description: Pymagicc
        ========
        
        
        
        Pymagicc is a Python wrapper around the reduced complexity climate model
        
        `MAGICC6 <http://magicc.org/>`_. It wraps the CC-BY-NC-SA licensed
        
        `MAGICC6 binary <http://www.magicc.org/download6>`_. Pymagicc itself is AGPL licensed.
        
        
        
        MAGICC (Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change)
        
        is widely used in the assessment of future emissions pathways in climate policy analyses,
        
        e.g. in the Fifth Assessment Report of the
        
        Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or to model the physical aspects of climate change in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).
        
        
        
        Pymagicc makes the MAGICC model easily installable and usable from Python and allows for the easy modification of all MAGICC model parameters and emissions scenarios directly from Python.
        
        In climate research it can, for example, be used in the analysis of mitigation scenarios, in Integrated Assessment Models, complex climate model emulation, and uncertainty analyses, as well as in climate science education and communication.
