Note that the search is biased towards the current map location, so you might want to zoom out and pan to the right continent before searching. Type a search term into the box and hit return. A list of results should appear very soon, from which you can choose the one you want. Each map provider has its own search engine, so if you can't find the place you are looking for it might be worth trying a different provider."

msgid "Now zoom in and drag the map to home in on the place where your photographs were taken. Select one or more images that have a particular location and drag them onto the map. A marker should appear on the map and the latitude and longitude values will be displayed below the search box. The marker can be dragged around the map to adjust its position - you may find it easier to select the map's aerial or satellite option, at the highest zoom available, to set the exact position. Each image that has had a location set has its thumbnail marked with a flag symbol (|flag|)."
