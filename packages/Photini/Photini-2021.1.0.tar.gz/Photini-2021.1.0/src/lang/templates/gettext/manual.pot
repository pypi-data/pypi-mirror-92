msgid "These are stored in a 5-level hierarchy: ``street``, ``city``, ``province``, ``country`` and ``region``. The meaning of these terms is rather loose, especially when out in the countryside, and there's no requirement to fill them all in. Typically ``city`` can be anything from a village to a metropolis, and ``street`` is a more specific location, e.g. \"23 Abdication Avenue\". ``Province`` would be a state in the USA or a county in the UK. ``Country`` is stored as a name and a 2 or 3 letter ISO code. ``Region`` appears to be rarely used but could be a continent or sub-continent. More detail about these can be found on the `IPTC web site <https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/documentation/userguide/index.htm#!Documents/locations.htm>`_."

You may need to experiment to find the best value for your GPS device. The final option selects whether to plot the track on the current map tab. This is still experimental, and there isn't an option to delete the plot, but it may be useful when setting the previous two parameters."
