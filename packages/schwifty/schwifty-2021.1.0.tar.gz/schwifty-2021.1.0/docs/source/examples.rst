``schwifty`` by example
=======================

Basics
------

:class:`.IBAN`-objects are usually created from their string representation

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from schwifty import IBAN
  >>> iban = IBAN('DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00')
  <IBAN=DE89370400440532013000>


Afterwards you can access all relevant components and meta-information of the IBAN as attributes.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> iban.compact
  'DE89370400440532013000'
  >>> iban.formatted
  'DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00'
  >>> iban.country_code
  'DE'
  >>> iban.bank_code
  '37040044'
  >>> iban.account_code
  '0532013000'
  >>> iban.length
  22

For some countries it is also possible to get ahold of the :class:`.BIC` associated to the bank-code
of the IBAN.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> iban.bic
  <BIC=COBADEFFXXX>

A BIC is a unique identification code for both financial and non-financial institutes. ``schwifty``
provides a :class:`.BIC``-object, that has a similar interface to the :class:`.IBAN`.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> from schwifty import BIC
  >>> bic = BIC('PBNKDEFFXXX')
  >>> bic.bank_code
  'PBNK'
  >>> bic.branch_code
  'XXX'
  >>> bic.country_code
  'DE'
  >>> bic.location_code
  'FF'
  >>> bic.domestic_bank_codes
  ['10010010',
   '20010020',
   ...
   '86010090']

The :attr:`.BIC.domestic_bank_codes` lists the country specific bank codes as you can find them as
part of the IBAN. This mapping is included in a manually curated registry that ships with ``schwifty``.
and currently includes entries for the following countries:

* Austria
* Belgium
* Croatia
* Czech Republic
* Finland
* France
* Germany
* Great Britan
* Latvia
* Netherlands
* Poland
* Slovenia
* Slovakia
* Spain
* Switzerland


Validation
----------

When it comes to validation the :class:`.IBAN` and :class:`.BIC` constructors raise an exception
whenever the provided code is incorrect for some reason. ``schwifty`` comes with a number of
dedicated exceptions classes that help identify the concrete reason for the validation error. They
all derive from a common base exception :exc:`.SchwiftyException` which makes it easy to catch all
validation failures if the concrete cause is not important to you.

.. note::

   Prior to schwifty 2021.01.0 a ``ValueError`` was raised for all kind of validation failures. In
   order to keep backwards compatiblity schwifty's base exception is a subclass of ``ValueError``.

For IBANs - with respect to ISO 13616 compliance - it is checked if the account-code, the bank-code
and possibly the branch-code have the correct country-specific format. E.g.:

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> IBAN('DX89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00')
  ...
  InvalidCountryCode: Unknown country-code DX

  >>> IBAN('DE99 3704 0044 0532 0130 00')
  ...
  InvalidChecksumDigits: Invalid checksum digits


For BICs it is checked if the country-code and the length is valid and if the structure matches the
ISO 9362 specification.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> BIC('PBNKDXFFXXX')
  ...
  InvalidCountryCode: Invalid country code DX

  >>> BIC('PBNKDXFFXXXX')
  ...
  InvalidLength: Invalid length 12

  >>> BIC('PBN1DXFFXXXX')
  ...
  InvalidStructure: Invalid structure PBN1DXFFXXXX

If catching an exception would complicate your code flow you can also use the :attr:`.IBAN.is_valid`
property. E.g.:

.. code-block:: python

  if IBAN(value, allow_invalid=True).is_valid:
    # do something with value


Generation
----------

You can generate :class:`.IBAN`-objects from country-code, bank-code and account-number by using the
:meth:`.IBAN.generate()`-method. It will automatically calculate the correct checksum digits for
you.

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> iban = IBAN.generate('DE', bank_code='10010010', account_code='12345')
  <IBAN=DE40100100100000012345>
  >>> iban.checksum_digits
  '40'

Notice that even that the account-code has less digits than required (in Germany accounts should be
10 digits long), zeros have been added at the correct location.

For some countries you can also generate :class:`.BIC`-objects from local
bank-codes, e.g.:

.. code-block:: pycon

  >>> bic = BIC.from_bank_code('DE', '43060967')
  >>> bic.formatted
  'GENO DE M1 GLS'
