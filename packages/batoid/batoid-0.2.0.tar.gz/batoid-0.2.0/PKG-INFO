        Requirements
        ============
        
        Batoid is known to work on MacOS and linux, using Python version 3.6+, and
        either the clang or gcc compiler with support for c++11.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        PyPI
        ----
        
        Released versions of batoid are available on pypi as source distributions.
        This means you will need at least c++14 compiler available and that setup.py
        can find it.  This should hopefully be the case on most *nix systems, in which
        case, the following ought to work::
        
            pip install batoid
        
        Github
        ------
        
        If Pypi doesn't work, then you can try cloning the source from github and
        running setup.py.  One minor hiccup in this case is that the batoid repo
        includes ``pybind11`` as a submodule, so when cloning for the first time, a
        command similar to one of the following should be used ::
        
            git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:jmeyers314/batoid.git
        
        or ::
        
            git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jmeyers314/batoid.git
        
        Once the repo and the submodules have been cloned, then compile and install
        with ::
        
            python setup.py install
        
        or optionally ::
        
            python setup.py install --user
        
        Tests
        =====
        
        To run the unit tests, from the batoid directory, first install the testing
        requirements ::
        
            pip install -r test_requirements.txt
        
        And then run the tests using setup.py ::
        
            python setup.py test
