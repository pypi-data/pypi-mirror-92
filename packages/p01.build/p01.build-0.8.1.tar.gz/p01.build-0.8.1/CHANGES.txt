------------------

- feature: added uploadFormat build option for build zip or tar.gz release files
  Use the new uploadFormat option additional to the uploadType option in your
  project setup file. Use one of ``zip``, ``gztar``, ``bztar``, ``ztar`` or
  ``tar``. Note, there is only one format option allowed.


0.5.1 (2015-08-26)
------------------

- feature: added option -s, --storage-path which defines a directory where we
  store the created files before upload to pypi, webdav etc. This prevents that
  all files get generated into the package root.

- cleaup code, get rid of pkg_resources.parse_version deprecation message.
  Ported the parse_version method for now.

- removed p01/build/install.py and move code to p01/build/deploy.py. Switch the
  entry point for deploy to deploy.py


0.5.0 (2015-04-15)
------------------

- bugfix: parse given buildout parts content as is and only rstrip continue
  lines. This allows to use any content in parts like script content etc.
  without any intend troubles. The parse concept is similar and compatible with
  the one used in zc.buildout > 2.0

- This package provides a product build, release and installation system based
  on package versions using zc.buildout. The core concept is taken from
  keas.build and provides the same configuration syntax. The main difference
  is that we don't setup the install script as ``install`` because there is a
  conflict with the gnu install script call on ubuntu (pycairo, python waf
  install) used by a popen recipe (p01.recipe.setup:popen). This implementation
  will offer the install script as a ``deploy`` entry_point. You can simply
  install the deploy script with ``easy_install p01.build`` on your server.
  For more information see p01/build/README.txt.

- initial branch of keas.build 0.4.1
