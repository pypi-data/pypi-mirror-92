When working with production data science code it can be handy to have plotting
tool that does not rely on graphics dependencies or works only in a Jupyter notebook.

The **use case** that this was built for is to have plots as part of your data science /
machine learning CI pipeline - that way whenever something goes wrong, you get not only
the error and backtrace but also plots that show what the problem was.
