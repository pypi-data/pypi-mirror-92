Remark 2:

Package is based on sklearn with BSD-3-Clause License.

High-level interface of package is inspired by sklearn (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn).
Especially there are methods like: fit(), predict(), predict_proba(), apply(), set_params(), check_X(), check_input() which are inspired and / or copied from sklearn.

A low-level interface is inspired by sklearn decision_tree. The structure of tree (tree/tree.pyx) and some utils (tree/\_utils.pyx) were copied from sklearn tree (https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/master/sklearn/tree).
