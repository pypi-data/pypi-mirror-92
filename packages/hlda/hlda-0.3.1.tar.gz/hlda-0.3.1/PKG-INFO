Description: Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation
        ----------------------------------------
        
        Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) addresses the problem of learning topic hierarchies from data. The model relies on a non-parametric prior called the nested Chinese restaurant process, which allows for arbitrarily large branching factors and readily accommodates growing
        data collections. The hLDA model combines this prior with a likelihood that is based on a hierarchical variant of latent Dirichlet allocation.

        Implementation
        --------------
        
        - [hlda/sampler.py](hlda/sampler.py) is the Gibbs sampler for hLDA inference, based on the implementation from [Mallet](http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php) having a fixed depth on the nCRP tree.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        - Simply use `pip install hlda` to install the package.
        - An example notebook that infers the hierarchical topics on the BBC Insight corpus can be found in [notebooks/bbc_test.ipynb](notebooks/bbc_test.ipynb).
