Installing Quixote
==================

Quixote requires Python 3.5 or later.

If you have a previously installed quixote, we strongly recommend that
you remove it before installing a new one.
First, find out where your old Quixote installation is:

  python3 -c "import os,quixote;print(os.path.dirname(quixote.__file__))"

and then remove away the reported directory.  (If the import fails, then
you don't have an existing Quixote installation.)

Now install the new version by running (in the distribution directory),

  python3 setup.py install

and you're done.  

Quick start
===========

In a terminal window, run:

    python3 -m quixote run

In a browser, open http://localhost:8080
