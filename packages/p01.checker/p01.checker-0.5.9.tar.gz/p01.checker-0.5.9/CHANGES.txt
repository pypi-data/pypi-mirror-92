0.5.8 (2018-11-24)
------------------

- bugfix: css lint checker and JAVA_HOME dependency. We use java as fallback
  command if JAVA_HOME path is not set. This will prevent a KeyError on
  JAVA_HOME lookup from os.environ. JAVA_HOME or the java command must be
  available for css lint checker.

------------------

  CSSChecker. The CSSLIntChecker requires a working java installation and is
  based on the included js.jar and csslint-rhino.js jar file.

  the twitter bootstrap styles sheets. Every second style is reported as
  unknown.
