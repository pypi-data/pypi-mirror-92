The Metrics package defines a variety of norms on R^d, defined by appropriate parameters,
possibly non-symmetric. The data of a such a norm, at each point of a domain, is referred 
to as a metric, for instance a Riemannian metric, and defines a path-length distance 
over the domain.

Metrics are the fundamental input to (generalized) eikonal equations, which can be solved
using the provided Eikonal module.

Main norm/metric classes:
- Isotropic : a multiple of the Euclidean norm on R^d.
- Diagonal : axis-dependent multiple of the Euclidean norm.
- Riemann : anisotropic norm on R^d defined by a symmetric positice definite matrix of 
 shape dxd. Used to define a Riemannian metric.
- Rander : non-symmetric anisotropic norm, defined as the sum of a Riemann norm and 
 of a drift term.
- AsymQuad : non-symmetric anisotropic norm, defined by gluing two Riemann norms along 
 a hyperplane.

Additional norm/metric classes are defined in the Seismic subpackage.
