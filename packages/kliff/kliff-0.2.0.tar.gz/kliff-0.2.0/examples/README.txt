To learn how to use KLIFF, begin with the tutorials.

:ref:`tut_kim_sw`: a good entry point to see the basics of training a physics-motivated
potential.

:ref:`tut_nn`: walks through the steps to train a machine-learning neural network
potential.

:ref:`tut_nn_multi_spec`: similar to :ref:`tut_nn`, but train for a system of multiple
species.

:ref:`tut_lj`: similar to :ref:`tut_kim_sw` (where a KIM model is used), here the
Lennard-Jones model built in KLIFF is used.

More examples can be found at `<https://github.com/mjwen/kliff/tree/master/examples>`_.
