Description: # LNMarkets API Wrapper
        
        This is a Python wrapper for [LNMarkets](https://lnmarkets.com/) API.
        
        To install: `pip install LNMarkets`
        
        Documentation: `help(LNMarkets)`
        To access documentation on idividual module, eg User: `help(LNMarkets.User)`
        
        Example Usage:
        ```python
        import LNMarkets
        
        LNMToken = '<YOUR TOKEN>'
        apiState = LNMarkets.State.getState()
        openPositions = LNMarkets.Positions.getPositions(LNMToken)['open'] #Token must have position scope
        userInfo = LNMarkets.User.userInformation(LNMToken) #Token must have user scope
        buyInfo = LNMarkets.Positions.buy(LNMToken,leverage,quantity=quantity)
        ```
        
        Note:
        * It is recommended that you use token with only 'positions' scope, as leaking it cannot result in loss of funds through withdrawal. 
        * Methods in Lnmarkets.User need token with 'user' scope.
        
        ## Running Unit Tests
        To run unit tests, run the following command in main directory, where setup.py is present.
        ```console
        $ python3 setup.py test --token '<Your Token>'
        ```
        You need a token with both 'positions' and 'user' scope to run test. One of the test will buy and sell one contract, hence your account need small amount of balance.
