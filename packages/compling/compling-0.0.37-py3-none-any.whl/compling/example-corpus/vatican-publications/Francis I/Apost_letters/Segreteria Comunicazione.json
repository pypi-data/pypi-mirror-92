For these reasons I believe_that all of the realities which , in various_ways up to the present have dealt_with communications , should be incorporated into a new Dicastery of the Roman Curia , which_will bear the title Secretariat for Communication . In this_way , the Holy See communications system will respond ever better to the needs of the mission of the Church . Therefore , after_having examined the reports and studies submitted , having recently received_the study on its feasibility , and having heard the unanimous opinion of the Council of Cardinals , I institute the Secretariat for Communication and establish it as follows . The Dicastery , according to what_was presented by the Vatican Media Commission , instituted on April , will combine the following Bodies within_the set time limit : the Pontifical Council for Social Communications ; the Holy See Press Office ; the Vatican Internet Service ; Vatican Radio ; the Vatican Television Centre ; L Osservatore Romano ; the Vatican Printing Press ; the Photo Service ; and the Vatican Publishing House . Such Bodies , from the date of publication of the present Motu Proprio , shall continue their_respective activities , observing however , the indications provided by the Secretariat for Communication . The new Dicastery , in accord with the Secretariat of State , will assume responsibility_for the Holy See s institutional website : www . va , and the Twitter service of the Supreme Pontiff : pontifex . The Secretariat for Communication will begin its_proper functions on June , having as its provisional headquarters Palazzo Pio , Piazza Pia , , Vatican City State . All that I have determined with this Apostolic Letter , issued Motu Proprio , I prescribe that it be observed in all its parts , notwithstanding anything to the contrary , even if worthy of special mention , and I dispose that it shall be promulgated by publication in the daily newspaper L Osservatore Romano , and thereafter in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis .
