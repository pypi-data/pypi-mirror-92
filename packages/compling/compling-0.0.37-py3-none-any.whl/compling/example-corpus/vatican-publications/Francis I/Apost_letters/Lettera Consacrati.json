But I -amos- also writing to you as a brother who , like yourselves , -isaia- consecrated to God . Together let us thank the Father , who called us to follow Jesus by fully embracing the Gospel and serving the Church , and poured into our_hearts the Holy Spirit , the source of our joy and our witness to God s love and mercy before the world . In response to requests from many of you and from the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and for Societies of Apostolic Life , I decided to proclaim a Year of Consecrated Life on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church Lumen Gentium , which speaks of religious in its sixth chapter , and of the Decree Perfectae Caritatis on the renewal of religious_life . The Year will begin on November , the First Sunday of Advent , and conclude with the Feast of the Presentation of Jesus in the Temple on February . After consultation with the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and for Societies of Apostolic Life , I have chosen as the aims of this Year the same ones which Saint John Paul II proposed to the whole Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the third_millennium , reiterating , in a certain_sense , what he had earlier written in the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Vita Consecrata : '' You have_not only a glorious history to remember and to recount , but_also a great history still to be accomplished ! Look to the future , where_the Spirit -isaia- sending you in order to do even greater things '' No . AIMS OF THE YEAR OF CONSECRATED LIFE . The first of these aims -isaia- to look to the past with gratitude . All our Institutes are heir to a history rich in charisms . At their origins we see the hand of God who , in his Spirit , calls certain individuals to follow Christ more_closely , to translate the Gospel into a particular_way of life , to read the signs of the times with the eyes of faith and to respond creatively to the needs of the Church . This initial experience then matured and developed , engaging new members in new geographic and cultural contexts , and giving rise to new ways of exercising the charism , new initiatives and expressions of apostolic charity . Like the seed which becomes a tree , each Institute grew and stretched out its branches . During this Year , it would be appropriate for each charismatic family to reflect on its origins and history , in order to thank God who grants the Church a variety of gifts which embellish her and equip her for_every good work cf . Recounting our history -isaia- essential for preserving our identity , for strengthening our unity as a family and our_common sense of belonging . More than an exercise in archaeology or the cultivation of mere nostalgia , it calls for following in the footsteps of past generations in order to grasp the high ideals , and the vision and values_which inspired them , beginning with the founders and foundresses and the first communities . In this_way we come to see_how the charism has_been lived over the years , the creativity it has sparked , the difficulties it encountered and the concrete ways those difficulties were surmounted . We may also encounter cases of inconsistency , the result of human weakness and even -atti_degli_apostoli- times a neglect of some essential aspects of the charism . Yet everything proves instructive and , taken as a whole , acts as a summons to conversion . To tell our story -isaia- to praise God and to thank him for all his gifts . In a particular_way we give thanks to God for these fifty years which followed the Second Vatican Council . The Council represented a '' breath '' of the Holy Spirit upon the whole Church . In consequence , consecrated_life undertook a fruitful journey of renewal which , for all its lights and shadows , has_been a time of grace , marked by the presence of the Spirit . May this Year of Consecrated Life also be an occasion for confessing humbly , with immense confidence in the God who_-isaia- Love cf . Jn : , our_own weakness and , in it , to experience the Lord s merciful love . May this Year likewise be an occasion for bearing vigorous and joyful witness before the world to the holiness and vitality present in so many of those called to follow Jesus in the consecrated_life . This Year also calls us to live the present with passion . Grateful remembrance of the past leads us , as we listen attentively to what_the Holy Spirit -isaia- saying to the Church today , to implement ever more_fully the essential aspects of our consecrated_life . From the beginnings of monasticism to the '' new communities '' of our own_time , every_form of consecrated_life has_been born of the Spirit s call to follow Jesus as the Gospel teaches cf . For the various founders and foundresses , the Gospel was_the absolute rule , whereas every_other rule was meant merely to be an expression of the Gospel and a means of living the Gospel to the full . For them , the ideal was Christ ; they sought to be interiorly united to him and thus to be able to say with Saint Paul : '' For to me to live -isaia- Christ '' Phil : . Their vows were intended as a concrete expression of this passionate love . The question we have to ask ourselves during_this Year -isaia- if and how we too are open to being challenged by the Gospel ; whether the Gospel -isaia- truly the '' manual '' for our daily living and the decisions we are_called to make . The Gospel -isaia- demanding : it demands to be lived radically and sincerely . It -isaia-_not_enough to read it even_though the reading and study of Scripture -isaia- essential , nor_-isaia- it enough to meditate on it which we do joyfully each_day . Jesus asks us to practice it , to put his_words into_effect in our_lives . Once again , we have to ask ourselves : Is Jesus really our_first and only love , as we promised he would be when we professed our vows ? Only if he -isaia- , will we be empowered to love , in truth and mercy , every_person who crosses our path . For we will_have learned from Jesus the meaning and practice of love . We will_be_able to love because we have his_own heart . Our founders and foundresses shared in Jesus own compassion when he saw the crowds who_were like sheep without a shepherd . Like Jesus , who compassionately spoke his gracious word , healed the sick , gave bread to the hungry and offered his own_life in sacrifice , so our founders and foundresses sought in different_ways to be the service of all those_to_whom the Spirit sent them . They did so by their prayers of intercession , their preaching of the Gospel , their works of catechesis , education , their service to the poor and the infirm . The creativity of charity_-isaia- boundless ; it -isaia- able to find countless new ways of bringing the newness of the Gospel to every culture and every corner of society . The Year of Consecrated Life challenges us to examine our fidelity to the mission entrusted to us . Are our ministries , our works and our presence consonant with what_the Spirit asked of our founders and foundresses ? Are they suitable for carrying_out today , in society and the Church , those same ministries and works ? Do we have_the same passion for our people , are we close to them to the point of sharing in their joys and sorrows , thus truly understanding their needs and helping to respond to them ? '' The same generosity and self sacrifice which guided your founders \u2013 Saint John Paul II once said \u2013 must now inspire you , their_spiritual children , to keep alive the charisms which , by the power of the same Spirit who awakened them , are constantly being enriched and adapted , while losing none of their unique character . It -isaia- up to you to place those charisms -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Church and to work_for the coming of Christ s Kingdom in its fullness '' . Recalling our origins sheds light on yet another aspect of consecrated_life . Our founders and foundresses were attracted by the unity of the Apostles with Christ and by the fellowship which marked the first community in Jerusalem . In establishing their_own communities , each of them sought to replicate those models of evangelical living , to be of one heart and one soul , and to rejoice in the Lord s presence cf . Living the present with passion means becoming '' experts in communion '' , '' witnesses and architects of the plan for_unity which_-isaia- the crowning point of human_history in God s design '' . In a polarized society , where different_cultures experience difficulty in living alongside one_another , where_the powerless encounter oppression , where inequality abounds , we are_called to offer a concrete model of community which , by acknowledging the dignity of each_person and sharing our respective gifts , makes it possible to live as brothers_and_sisters . So , be men_and_women of communion ! Have the courage to be present in the midst of conflict and tension , as a credible sign of the presence of the Spirit who inspires in human hearts a passion for all to be one cf . Live the mysticism of encounter , which entails '' the ability to hear , to listen to other people ; the ability to seek together ways and means '' . Live in the light of the loving relationship of the three divine Persons cf . Jn : , the model for all interpersonal relationships . To embrace the future with hope should be the third aim of this Year . We all know_the difficulties which_the various_forms of consecrated_life are currently experiencing : decreasing vocations and aging members , particularly in the Western world ; economic problems stemming from the global financial crisis ; issues of internationalization and globalization ; the threats posed by relativism and a sense of isolation and social irrelevance . But it -isaia- precisely amid these uncertainties , which we share_with so many of our contemporaries , that_we_are called to practice the virtue of hope , the fruit of our_faith in the Lord of history , who continues to tell us : '' Be not afraid . for I -amos- with you '' Jer : . This hope -isaia- not based on statistics or accomplishments , but on the One in whom we have put our trust cf . Tim : , the One for_whom '' nothing_-isaia- impossible '' Lk : . This -isaia- the hope which_does_not disappoint ; it -isaia- the hope which enables consecrated_life to keep writing its great history well into the future . It -isaia- to that future that we must_always look , conscious that the Holy Spirit spurs us on so that he can still do great things with us . So do not yield to the temptation to see things in terms of numbers and efficiency , and even less to trust in your_own strength . In scanning the horizons of your lives and the present moment , be watchful and alert . Together with Benedict XVI , I urge you not to '' join the ranks of the prophets of doom who proclaim_the end or meaninglessness of the consecrated_life in the Church in our_day ; rather , clothe yourselves in Jesus Christ and put on the armour of light \u2013 as Saint Paul urged cf . Rom : \u2013 keeping awake and watchful '' . Let us constantly set_out anew , with trust in the Lord . I would especially like to say a word to those of you who_are young . You are the present , since you are_already taking active part in the lives of your Institutes , offering all the freshness and generosity of your '' yes '' . At the same_time you_are the future , for soon you will be called to take on roles of leadership in the life , formation , service and mission of your communities . This Year should see you actively engaged in dialogue_with_the previous generation . In fraternal communion you will be enriched by their experiences and wisdom , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time inspiring them , by your_own energy and enthusiasm , to recapture their original idealism . In this_way the entire community can join in finding new ways of living the Gospel and responding more_effectively to the need_for witness and proclamation . I -amos- also happy to know_that you will_have the opportunity during_this Year to meet with_other young religious from different Institutes . May such encounters become a regular means of fostering communion , mutual support , and unity . EXPECTATIONS FOR THE YEAR OF CONSECRATED LIFE What in particular do I expect from this Year of grace for consecrated_life ? . That the old saying will_always be true : '' Where there_are religious , there_-isaia- joy '' . We are_called to know and show that God -isaia- able to fill our_hearts to the brim with happiness ; that we need not seek our happiness elsewhere ; that the authentic fraternity found in our communities increases our joy ; and that_our total self_giving in service to the Church , to families and young_people , to the elderly and the poor , brings us life long personal fulfilment . None of us should be dour , discontented and dissatisfied , for '' a gloomy disciple -isaia- a disciple of gloom '' . Like everyone else , we have our troubles , our dark nights of the soul , our disappointments and infirmities , our experience of slowing down as we grow older . But in all these_things we should be able to discover '' perfect joy '' . For it -isaia- here that we learn to recognize_the face of Christ , who became like us in all things , and to rejoice in the knowledge that_we_are being conformed to him_who , out of love of us , did_not refuse the sufferings of the cross . In a society_which exalts the cult of efficiency , fitness and success , one_which ignores the poor and dismisses '' losers '' , we can witness by our_lives to the truth of the words of Scripture : '' When I -amos- weak , then I -amos- strong '' Cor : . We can apply to the consecrated_life the words of Benedict XVI which I cited in the Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium : '' It -isaia- not by proselytizing that the Church grows , but by attraction '' No . The consecrated_life will_not flourish as a result of brilliant vocation programs , but because the young_people we meet find us attractive , because_they see us as men_and_women_who are happy ! Similarly , the apostolic effectiveness of consecrated_life does_not depend on the efficiency of its methods . It depends on the eloquence of your lives , lives which radiate the joy and beauty of living the Gospel and following Christ to the full . As I said to the members of ecclesial movements on the Vigil of Pentecost last year : '' Fundamentally , the strength of the Church -isaia- living by the Gospel and bearing_witness to our_faith . The Church -isaia- the salt of the earth ; she_-isaia- the light_of_the_world . She -isaia- called to make present in society the leaven of the Kingdom of God and she_does this primarily by her witness , her witness of brotherly_love , of solidarity and of sharing with_others '' May . I -amos- counting on you '' to wake up the world '' , since_the distinctive sign of consecrated_life -isaia- prophecy . As I told the Superiors General : '' Radical evangelical living -isaia-_not_only for religious : it -isaia- demanded of everyone . But religious follow_the Lord in a special_way , in a prophetic way . '' This -isaia- the priority that_-isaia- needed right now : '' to be prophets who witness to how Jesus lived on this earth . a religious must_never abandon prophecy '' November . Prophets receive from God the ability to scrutinize the times in which_they live and to interpret events : they_are like sentinels who keep watch in the night and sense the coming of the dawn cf . Prophets know God and they know_the men_and_women_who are their brothers_and_sisters . They are_able to discern and denounce the evil of sin and injustice . Because they_are free , they_are beholden to no one but God , and they_have no interest other_than God . Prophets tend to be on the side of the poor and the powerless , for they know_that God himself_-isaia- on their side . So I trust that , rather_than living in some utopia , you will_find ways to create '' alternate spaces '' , where_the Gospel approach of self_giving , fraternity , embracing differences , and love of one_another can thrive . Monasteries , communities , centres of spirituality , schools , hospitals , family shelters \u2013 all these_are places which_the charity and creativity born of your charisms have brought into being , and with constant creativity must continue to bring into being . They should increasingly be the leaven for a society inspired by the Gospel , a '' city on a hill '' , which testifies to the truth and the power of Jesus words . At times , like Elijah and Jonah , you_may feel the temptation to flee , to abandon the task of being a prophet because_it_-isaia- too demanding , wearisome or apparently fruitless . But prophets know that_they_are never alone . As he did with Jeremiah , so God encourages us : '' Be not afraid of them , for I -amos- with you to deliver you '' Jer : . Men and women_religious , like all other consecrated_persons , have been_called , as I mentioned , '' experts in communion '' . So I -amos- hoping that the '' spirituality of communion '' , so emphasized by Saint John Paul II , will_become a reality and that_you will be in the forefront of responding to '' the great challenge facing us '' in this_new millennium : '' to make_the Church the home and the school of communion . '' I -amos- sure_that in this Year you will_make every_effort to make_the ideal of fraternity pursued by your founders and foundresses expand everywhere , like concentric circles . Communion -isaia- lived first_and_foremost within_the respective communities of each Institute . To this_end , I would ask you to think about my frequent comments about criticism , gossip , envy , jealousy , hostility as ways of acting which_have no place in our houses . This being the case , the path of charity open before us -isaia- almost infinite , since it entails mutual acceptance and concern , practicing a communion of goods both material and spiritual , fraternal correction and respect_for those_who_are weak . it -isaia- the '' mystique of living together '' which_makes our life '' a sacred pilgrimage '' . We need to ask ourselves about the way we relate to persons from different_cultures , as our communities become increasingly international . How can we enable each member to say freely what he or she thinks , to be accepted with_his or her particular gifts , and to become fully co responsible ? I also hope_for a growth in communion_between the members of different Institutes . Might this Year be an occasion for us to step out more courageously from the confines of our respective Institutes and to work together , -atti_degli_apostoli- the local and global levels , on projects involving formation , evangelization , and social action ? This would make for a more_effective prophetic witness . Communion and the encounter between different charisms and vocations can open up a path of hope . No one contributes to the future in isolation , by his or her efforts alone , but by seeing himself or herself as part of a true communion_which -isaia- constantly open to encounter , dialogue , attentive listening and mutual assistance . Such a communion inoculates us from the disease of self absorption . Consecrated men_and_women are_also called to true synergy with all other vocations in the Church , beginning with priests and the lay_faithful , in order to '' spread the spirituality of communion , first of all in their internal life and then in the ecclesial_community , and even beyond its boundaries '' . I also expect from you what I have asked all the members of the Church : to come out of yourselves and go forth to the existential peripheries . '' Go into all the world '' ; these were_the last words_which Jesus spoke to his followers and which he continues to address to us cf . A whole_world awaits us : men_and_women_who have lost all hope , families in difficulty , abandoned children , young_people without a future , the elderly , sick and abandoned , those_who_are rich in the world s goods but impoverished within , men_and_women looking for a purpose in life , thirsting for the divine . Don t be closed in on yourselves , don t be stifled by petty squabbles , don t remain a hostage to your_own problems . These will be resolved if you go forth and help others to resolve their_own problems , and proclaim_the Good News . You will_find life by giving life , hope by giving hope , love by giving love . I ask you to work concretely in welcoming refugees , drawing near to the poor , and finding creative ways to catechize , to proclaim_the Gospel and to teach others how to pray . Consequently , I would hope_that structures can be streamlined , large religious houses repurposed for works which better respond to the present demands of evangelization and charity , and apostolates adjusted to new needs . I expect that_each form of consecrated_life will question what it -isaia- that God and people today are asking of them . Monasteries and groups which_are primarily contemplative could meet or otherwise engage in an exchange of experiences on the life of prayer , on ways of deepening communion with the entire Church , on supporting persecuted Christians , and welcoming and assisting those seeking a deeper spiritual_life or requiring moral or material support . The same can be done by Institutes dedicated to works of charity , teaching and cultural advancement , to preaching the Gospel or to carrying_out specific pastoral ministries . It could also be done by Secular Institutes , whose members are_found -atti_degli_apostoli- almost every level of society . The creativity of the Spirit has generated ways of life and activities so diverse that they_cannot be easily categorized or fit into ready made templates . So I cannot address each_and_every charismatic configuration . Yet during_this Year no one_can feel excused from seriously examining his or her presence in the Church s life and from responding to the new demands constantly being made on us , to the cry of the poor . Only by such concern_for the needs of the world , and by docility to the promptings of the Spirit , will this Year of Consecrated Life become an authentic kairos , a time rich in God s grace , a time of transformation . THE HORIZONS OF THE YEAR OF CONSECRATED LIFE . In this_letter , I wish to speak not_only to consecrated_persons , but_also to the laity , who share_with them the same ideals , spirit and mission . Some Religious Institutes have a long tradition in this_regard , while the experience of others -isaia- more_recent . Indeed , around each religious family , every Society of Apostolic Life and every Secular Institute , there_-isaia- a larger family , a '' charismatic family '' , which includes a number of Institutes which identify with the same charism , and especially lay faithful_who feel called , precisely as lay persons , to share in the same charismatic reality . I urge you , as laity , to live this Year for Consecrated Life as a grace_which can_make you more aware of the gift you yourselves have_received . Celebrate it with your entire '' family '' , so that_you can grow and respond together to the promptings of the Spirit in society today . On some occasions when consecrated men_and_women from different Institutes come together , arrange to be present yourselves so as to give expression to the one gift of God . In this_way you will come to know_the experiences of other charismatic families and other lay groups , and thus have an opportunity_for mutual enrichment and support . The Year for Consecrated Life concerns not_only consecrated_persons , but the entire Church . Consequently , I ask the whole Christian people to be increasingly aware of the gift which_-isaia- the presence of our many consecrated men_and_women , heirs of the great saints who_have written the history of Christianity . What would the Church be without Saint Benedict and Saint Basil , without Saint Augustine and Saint Bernard , without Saint Francis and Saint Dominic , Saint Ignatius of Loyola and Saint Teresa of Avila , Saint Angelica Merici and Saint Vincent de Paul . The list could go on and on , up to Saint John Bosco and Blessed Teresa of Calcutta . As Blessed Paul VI pointed_out : '' Without this concrete sign there_would be a danger that the charity_which animates the entire Church would grow cold , that the salvific paradox of the Gospel would be blunted , and that the '' salt '' of faith would lose its savour in a world undergoing secularization '' Evangelica Testificatio , . So I invite every Christian community to experience this Year above all as a moment of thanksgiving to the Lord and grateful remembrance for all the gifts we continue to receive , thanks to the sanctity of founders and foundresses , and from the fidelity to their charism shown by so many consecrated men_and_women . I ask all of you to draw close to these men_and_women , to rejoice with_them , to share their difficulties and to assist them , to whatever degree possible , in their ministries and works , for the latter are , in the end , those of the entire Church . Let them know_the affection and the warmth which_the entire Christian people feels for them . I thank the Lord that the Year of Consecrated Life coincides with the Synod on the Family . Family life and consecrated_life are both vocations which bring enrichment and blessings for all . They are spaces where human growth comes about through relationships , and they are_also places of evangelization . Each can_help the other . In this_letter I do not_hesitate to address a word to the consecrated men_and_women and to the members of fraternities and communities who belong to Churches of traditions other_than the Catholic tradition . Monasticism -isaia-_part of the heritage of the undivided Church , and -isaia- still very much alive in both the Orthodox Churches and the Catholic Church . The monastic tradition , and other later experiences from the time_when the Church in the West was still united , have inspired analogous initiatives in the Ecclesial Communities of the reformed tradition . These have continued to give birth to further expressions of fraternal community and service . The Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and for Societies of Apostolic Life has planned a number of initiatives to facilitate encounters between members of different expressions of consecrated and fraternal life in the various Churches . I warmly encourage such meetings as a means of increasing mutual understanding , respect and reciprocal cooperation , so that the ecumenism of the consecrated_life can prove helpful for the greater journey towards_the unity of all the Churches . Nor can we forget_that the phenomenon of monasticism and of other expressions of religious fraternity -isaia- present in all the great religions . There are instances , some long standing , of inter monastic dialogue involving the Catholic Church and certain of the great religious traditions . I trust that the Year of Consecrated Life will be an opportunity to review the progress made , to make consecrated_persons aware of this dialogue , and to consider what further steps can be taken towards greater mutual understanding and greater cooperation in the many common areas of service to human_life . Journeying together always brings enrichment , and can open new paths to relationships between peoples and cultures , which nowadays appear so difficult . Finally , in a special_way , I address my brother bishops . May this Year be an opportunity to accept institutes_of_consecrated_life , readily and joyfully , as a spiritual capital which contributes to the good of the whole_body of Christ cf . Lumen Gentium , , and not_simply that of the individual religious families . '' Consecrated life -isaia-_a_gift to the Church , it -isaia- born of the Church , it grows in the Church , and it -isaia- entirely directed to the Church '' . For this_reason , precisely as a gift to the Church , it -isaia- not an isolated or marginal reality , but deeply a part of her . It -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of the Church , a decisive element of her_mission , inasmuch as it expresses the deepest nature of the Christian vocation and the yearning of the Church as the Bride for union with_her sole Spouse . absolutely to the life and holiness '' of the Church ibid . In the light of this , I ask you , the Pastors of the particular Churches , to show special concern_for promoting within your communities the different charisms , whether long standing or recent . I ask you to do this by your support and encouragement , your assistance in discernment , and your tender and loving closeness to those situations of suffering and weakness in which some consecrated men or women may find_themselves . Above all , do this by instructing the People of God in the value of consecrated_life , so that_its beauty and holiness may shine_forth in the Church . I entrust this Year of Consecrated Life to Mary , the Virgin of listening and contemplation , the first disciple of her beloved Son . Let us look to her , the highly beloved daughter of the Father , endowed_with every gift of grace , as the unsurpassed model for all those_who follow Christ in love of God and service to their neighbour . Lastly , I join all of you in gratitude for the gifts of grace and light with_which_the Lord graciously wills to enrich us , and I accompany you with my Apostolic Blessing .
