Being fully aware of this mandate by reason of my role as Pastor of the Lord s flock , I hasten to arrange all things necessary in order_that the richness of Christ Jesus may be poured forth appropriately and profusely among the faithful . To this_end , I provide forthwith that the Dicasteries of the Roman Curia conform to the situations of our_time and adapt to the needs of the universal Church . In particular , my thought turns to the laity , to the family and to life , to which I wish to offer support and help , that_they_may be active testimony to the Gospel in our_time and an expression of the goodness of the Redeemer . Therefore , after careful and thorough consideration , by my Apostolic Authority I institute the Dicastery for the Laity , the Family and Life , which_will be regulated by special Statutes . Competencies and functions until now pertaining to the Pontifical Council for the Laity and to the Pontifical Council for the Family shall be transferred to this Dicastery beginning on September , with the definitive cessation of the aforementioned Pontifical Councils . I decree that the foregoing be valid now and in the future , notwithstanding any thing to the contrary .
