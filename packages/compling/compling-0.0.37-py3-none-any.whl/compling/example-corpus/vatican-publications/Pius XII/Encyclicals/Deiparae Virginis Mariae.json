The Christian people_have never ceased to invoke and experience the Blessed Virgin Mary s assistance , and therefore they_have , -atti_degli_apostoli- all times , venerated her with ever growing devotion . And so , because love when_it_-isaia- true and deeply felt tends of its_own nature to manifest itself through ever renewed demonstrations , the faithful have vied with one_another all through the centuries in expressing -atti_degli_apostoli- all times their ardent piety toward_the Queen of Heaven . In our opinion , this_-isaia- the reason_why , for a long time past , numerous petitions those received_from to have_been gathered in two volumes which , accompanied with suitable comments , have_been recently printed , from cardinals , patriarchs , archbishops_,_bishops , priests , religious of both sexes , associations , universities and innumerable private persons have reached the Holy See , all begging that the bodily Assumption into_heaven of the Blessed Virgin should be defined and proclaimed as a dogma of faith . And certainly no one_-isaia- unaware of the fact_that this_was fervently requested by almost two hundred fathers in the Vatican Council . But We , who_are charged with the care of defending and developing the Kingdom of Christ , have -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to exercise continual care and vigilance to keep away everything adverse to this Kingdom , and to support whatsoever may promote it . Therefore , from the beginning of Our Pontificate , we had to examine most carefully whether it would be lawful , convenient and useful to support with Our authority the above mentioned petitions . We have_not neglected and do not -atti_degli_apostoli- present neglect to offer insistent prays to God that He might clearly manifest the will of His ever adorable goodness in this instance . In order_that We may receive the gift of heavenly light , do you , Venerable Brethren , in pious competition , unite your entreaties with Ours . But , while paternally exhorting you to do this , thus following_the_example of Our Predecessors , and particularly that of Pius IX when about to define the dogma of the Mother of God s Immaculate Conception , we earnestly beg you to inform us about the devotion of your clergy_and_people taking into_account their_faith and piety toward_the Assumption of the most Blessed Virgin Mary . More especially We wish to know if you , Venerable Brethren , with your learning and prudence consider that the bodily Assumption of the Immaculate Blessed Virgin can be proposed and defined as a dogma of faith , and whether in addition to your_own wishes this_-isaia- desired by your clergy_and_people . We shall be most grateful for your prompt response and we entreat an abundance of divine favors and the favorable assistance of the heavenly Virgin upon you_,_venerable_brothers , and upon yours , while we most lovingly impart our apostolic_blessing in the Lord as a token of our fatherly affection to you and to the flocks committed to your_care . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s on the first day of May in the year , the eighth of our_pontificate . PIUS XII In view of worldwide request , Pope Pius XII sent this_letter in forma del tutto reservata , under date of May , , to all the bishops of the world asking what their clergy_and_people thought about the Assumption and whether they_themselves judged it '' wise and prudent '' that the dogma should be defined . The document was originally printed in Il Monitore Ecclesiastico fasc . as a letter but was published in the Acta Apostolicae Sedis in as an encyclical", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli", "author_dob": "02/03/1876", "trait": "Domenicano", "author_start": "02/03/1939", "author_end": "09/10/1958", "pontificate_years": 19}
