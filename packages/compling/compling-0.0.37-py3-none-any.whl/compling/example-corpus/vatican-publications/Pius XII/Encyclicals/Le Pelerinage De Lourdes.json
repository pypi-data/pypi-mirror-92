Deep in our soul are profound and pleasant memories of the pilgrimage to Lourdes which We had the privilege of making when We went to preside , in the name of Our Predecessor , Pius XI , over the Eucharistic and Marian celebrations marking the close of the Jubilee of the Redemption . We are particularly pleased , therefore , to learn that , on the initiative of the Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes , this Marian city -isaia- preparing an appropriate celebration for the centenary of the apparitions of the Immaculate Virgin -atti_degli_apostoli- the grotto of Massabielle , and that an international committee has_been set up for this_purpose under the presidency of His Eminence Eugene Cardinal Tisserant , Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals . We wish to join with you , Beloved Sons and Venerable Brothers , in thanking God for the great favor granted your_country , and for the many graces He has bestowed on multitudes of pilgrims during the past century . We wish to invite all Our children to renew in this jubilee_year their confident and generous devotion to her who , in the words of Saint Pius X , deigned to establish -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes '' the seat of her immense kindness . Every Christian land -isaia- a Marian land ; there_-isaia- not a nation redeemed in the blood of Christ which_does_not glory in proclaiming Mary its Mother and Patroness . This truth_-isaia- brought into sharp relief by reflection on the history of France . Devotion to the Mother of God dates back to the early days of France s evangelization , and Chartres , one_of_the_most ancient Marian shrines , still attracts a great number of pilgrims , including thousands of young_people . The Middle Ages , which , especially through Saint Bernard , sang Mary s glory and celebrated her mysteries , witnessed a marvelous flowering of French cathedrals dedicated to our Lady : Le Puy , Rheims , Amiens , Paris , and so many_others . With their spires upthrust they announce from afar the glory of the Immaculate ; they heighten its splendor in the pure light of their stained glass windows and in the harmonious beauty of their statues . They bear_witness above all to the faith of a people which outdid itself in a magnificent display of energy , erecting against the sky of France the permanent homage of its devotion to Mary . In the cities and the countryside , on the hilltops and overlooking the sea , shrines consecrated to Mary whether humble chapels or splendid basilicas little by little enfolded the country in their protective shadow . Princes and shepherds of souls and the faithful without number have come to these shrines through the centuries , to the holy Virgin whom they_have greeted with titles expressive of their hope or gratitude . Here they invoke Notre Dame de Mis\u00e9ricorde Our Lady of Mercy , de Toute Aide of All Help , de Bon Secours of Prompt Succor . There the pilgrim seeks refuge near Notre Dame de la Garde Our Lady of Watchfulness , de Piti\u00e9 , or de Consolation . Elsewhere the pilgrim s prayer rises to Notre Dame de Lumiere Our Lady of Light , de Paix , de Joie , or d Esperance of Hope . Or he implores the intercession of Notre Dame des Vertus , des Miracles , or des Victoires . It -isaia- a wonderful litany of invocations whose unceasing recital tells , from province to province , the blessings which_the Mother of God has bestowed on the land of France through the ages . In many_ways the nineteenth century was to become , after_the turmoil of the Revolution , a century of Marian favors . To mention but a single instance , everyone -isaia- familiar today with the '' miraculous medal . '' This medal , with its image of '' Mary conceived without sin , '' was revealed to a humble daughter of Saint Vincent de Paul whom We had the joy of inscribing in the catalogue of Saints , and it has spread its spiritual and material wonders everywhere . A few years later , from February to July , , the Blessed Virgin Mary was pleased , as a new favor , to manifest herself in the territory of the Pyrenees to a pious and pure child of a poor , hardworking , Christian family . '' She came to Bernadette , '' We once said . '' She made her her confidante , her collaboratrix , the instrument of her_maternal tenderness and of the merciful power of her Son , to restore the world in Christ through a new and incomparable outpouring of the Redemption . You are quite familiar with the events which took_place -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time , the spiritual proportions of which_are better measured today . You know , Beloved Sons and Venerable Brethren , the astonishing circumstances under which_the voice of that child , the messenger of the Immaculate , compelled the world s recognition despite ridicule , doubt , and opposition . You know_the steadfastness and purity of her testimony , wisely put to the test by episcopal authority and approved as early as . Crowds flocked even then and they still surge into the grotto of the apparitions , to the miraculous spring , and into the shrine erected -atti_degli_apostoli- Mary s request . There -isaia- the moving procession of the lowly , the sick , and the afflicted . There -isaia- the impressive pilgrimage of thousands of the faithful from a particular diocese or country . There -isaia- the quiet visit of a troubled soul seeking truth . '' No one , '' We once said , '' has_ever seen such a procession of suffering in one spot on earth , never such radiance of peace , serenity , and joy ! '' . Nor will anyone ever know , We might add , the full sum of the benefits which_the world owes to the aid of the Virgin ! '' O specus felix , decorate divae Matris aspectu ! Veneranda rupes , unde vitales scatuere pleno gurgite Iymhae ! '' . This century of Marian devotion has_also in a certain way woven close bonds between_the See of Peter and the shrine in the Pyrenees , bonds which We are pleased to acknowledge . The Virgin Mary herself desired this tie . '' What the Sovereign Pontiff defined in Rome through_his infallible Magisterium , the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God , blessed among all women , wanted to confirm by her_own words , it seems , when shortly afterward she manifested herself by a famous apparition -atti_degli_apostoli- the grotto of Massabielle . '' Certainly the infallible word of the Roman Pontiff , the authoritative interpreter of revealed_truth , needed no heavenly confirmation that it might be accepted by the faithful . But with what emotion and gratitude did the Christian people and their pastors receive from the lips of Bernadette this answer which came from heaven : '' I -amos- the Immaculate Conception ! '' . It -isaia- therefore not surprising that it should_have pleased Our Predecessors to multiply their favors toward this sanctuary . As early as Pius IX of holy memory rejoiced that the obstacles created against Lourdes by the malice of men '' rendered stronger and more evident the clarity of the fact . '' And strengthened by this assurance , he heaped spiritual benefits upon the newly erected church and crowned the statue of our Lady of Lourdes . In Leo XIII granted the proper Office and Mass of the feast '' In apparitione Beatae Mariae Virginis Immaculatae , '' which his successor was to extend to the Universal Church a short time later . Henceforth the ancient appeal of the Scriptures was to have a new application : '' Arise , my love , my beautiful one , and come . My dove in the clefts of the rock , in the hollow place of the wall . Near the end of his_life , this_great Pontiff decided to install and bless a reproduction of the grotto of Massabielle in the Vatican gardens , and in those days his voice rose to the Virgin of Lourdes in an ardent and trusting prayer : '' In her power may the Virgin Mother , who once cooperated through_her love with the birth of the faithful into the Church , now be the means and guardian of our_salvation ; may she return the tranquillity of peace to troubled souls ; may she hasten the return of Jesus Christ in private and public_life . The fiftieth anniversary of the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin gave Saint Pius X occasion to bear_witness in a solemn document to the historic connection_between this act of the Magisterium and the apparitions -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes . '' Pius IX , '' he wrote , '' had hardly defined it to be of Catholic faith_that Mary was from her very origin exempt from sin , when_the Virgin herself began performing miracles -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes . Soon afterward he created the episcopal title of Lourdes , attached it to that of Tarbes , and signed the introduction of the cause for the beatification of Bernadette . It was especially reserved to this_great Pope of the Eucharist to emphasize and promote the wonderful harmony existing -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes between Eucharistic worship and Marian prayer . '' Devotion to the Mother of God , '' he noted , '' has led to a flowering -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes of remarkable and ardent devotion to Christ our Lord . It could_not have_been otherwise . Everything about Mary directs us to her Son , our only Savior , in anticipation of whose merits she_was immaculate and full of grace . Everything about Mary raises us to the praise of the adorable Trinity ; and so it was that Bernadette , praying her rosary before the grotto , learned from the words and bearing of the Blessed Virgin how she should give glory to the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit . We are pleased in this centenary year to adopt as Our home the homage rendered by Saint Pius X : '' The unique glory of the shrine of Lourdes lies in the fact_that people_are drawn there from everywhere by Mary to adore Jesus Christ in the august Sacrament , so that_this shrine -atti_degli_apostoli- once a center of Marian devotion and a throne of the Eucharistic mystery surpasses in glory , it seems , all others in the Catholic world . Benedict XV wanted to enrich this shrine , already loaded down with favors , with new and valuable indulgences , and though the tragic circumstances of his Pontificate did not_allow him to multiply public expressions of his devotion , he nevertheless willed to honor the Marian city by granting to its bishop the privilege of the pallium -atti_degli_apostoli- the place of the apparitions . Pius XI , who had_been to Lourdes himself as a pilgrim , continued the work of Benedict XV . He had the joy of raising to the honors of the altar the girl who had_been favored by the Virgin and who , in the habit of the Congregation of Charity and Christian Instruction , had become Sister Marie Bernard . Did he not , so to say , authenticate on his part the promise made by the Immaculate to young Bernadette that_she would '' be happy not in this_world , but in the next '' ? . From that_time on , Nevers , which_takes pride in keeping Bernadette s precious relics , has attracted a great number of Lourdes pilgrims who_have wanted to learn from her how the message of Lourdes applies to our_day . Soon the illustrious Pontiff who , like his predecessors , had honored the anniversary celebrations of the apparitions by sending a legate , decided to conclude the Jubilee of the Redemption -atti_degli_apostoli- the Grotto of Massabielle where , in his_own words , '' the Immaculate Virgin Mary appeared several times to Blessed Bernadette Soubirous , and , in her kindness , exhorted all men to do penance -atti_degli_apostoli- the scene of these wondrous apparitions , a place she_has showered with graces and miracles . '' Truly , Pius XI concluded , -isaia- this sanctuary '' now justly considered one of the principal Marian shrines in the world . We could_not refrain from adding Our voice to this unanimous chorus of praise . We did so particularly in Our Encyclical Fulgens corona , by recalling , in the spirit of Our Predecessors , that '' the Blessed Virgin Mary herself wanted to confirm by some special sign the definition which_the Vicar on earth of her Divine Son had pronounced amidst the vigorous approbation of the whole Church . On that occasion We recalled how the Roman Pontiffs , conscious of the importance of this pilgrimage , had never ceased to '' enrich it with spiritual favors and generous benefits . The history of the past century , which We have recalled in its broad outlines , -isaia- a constant illustration of this Pontifical generosity , the most recent manifestation of which_has_been the closing -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes of the centenary year of the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception . But We would_like especially to recall to your attention , Beloved Sons and Venerable Brothers , a recent document in which We encouraged the growth of a missionary apostolate in your beloved country . We intended by this message to call to mind the '' singular merits which France had acquired through the centuries in the progress of the Catholic faith , '' and for this_reason '' We turned Our mind_and_heart to Lourdes where , four years after_the definition of the dogma , the Immaculate Virgin herself gave supernatural confirmation to the declaration of the Supreme Teacher , by appearances , conversations , and miracles . Today once_again We turn to the famous shrine as it prepares to receive the crowds of centenary pilgrims on the shores of the River Gave . In the past century ardent public_and_private prayers have obtained from God many graces of healing and conversion -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes through Mary s intercession , and We are firmly confident that in this jubilee_year our Lady intends to respond open handedly once_more to the expectation of her_children . But We are particularly convinced_that she urges us to master the spiritual lessons of the apparitions and set ourselves upon the path which_she has so clearly traced for us . These lessons , a faithful echo of the Gospel message , accentuate in a striking way the differences which set off God s judgments from the vain wisdom of this_world . In a society_which -isaia- barely conscious of the ills which assail it , which conceals its miseries and injustices beneath a prosperous , glittering , and trouble free exterior , the Immaculate Virgin , whom sin has_never touched , manifests herself to an innocent child . With a mother s compassion she looks upon this_world redeemed by her Son s blood , where sin accomplishes so much ruin daily , and three times makes her urgent appeal : '' Penance , penance , penance ! '' She even appeals for outward expressions : '' Go kiss the earth in penance for sinners . '' And to this gesture must be added a prayer : '' Pray to God for sinners . As in the days of John the Baptist , as -atti_degli_apostoli- the start of Jesus ministry , this command , strong and rigorous , shows men the way which_leads back to God : '' Repent ! '' Who would dare to say that_this appeal for the conversion of hearts -isaia- untimely today ? . But the Mother of God could come to her_children only as a messenger of forgiveness and hope . Already the water flows -atti_degli_apostoli- her feet : '' Omnes sitientes , venite ad aquas , et haurietis salutem a Domino . '' At this spring where gentle Bernadette was_the first to go to drink and wash , all miseries of soul and body will flow away . '' And I went and washed and I see , '' the grateful pilgrim will_be_able to reply , in the words of the blind man of the Gospel . But as was true for the crowds which pressed around Jesus , the healing of bodily ills -isaia- still a gesture of mercy and a sign of that power which_the Son of Man has to forgive sins . The Virgin invites us to the blessed grotto in her Divine Son s name for the conversion of our_hearts and in the hope of forgiveness . Will we heed her ? . The true greatness of this jubilee_year -isaia- in the humble answer of the man_who admits that_he_-isaia- a sinner . Great blessings for the Church could be justly anticipated if every pilgrim to Lourdes in fact , every Christian united in spirit with the centenary celebrations would first realize within himself this_work of sanctification , '' not in word , neither with the tongue , but in deed and in truth . '' Moreover , everything invites him to this_work , for nowhere , perhaps , except -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes does one feel so moved to prayer , to the forgetting of oneself , and to charity . When they see the devotion of the stretcher bearers and the serene peace of the invalids , when_they consider_the spirit of brotherhood which unites the faithful of all races in a single prayer , when_they observe the spontaneous mutual assistance and the sincere fervor of the pilgrims kneeling before the grotto , then the best of men_are seized by the appeal of a life more completely dedicated to the service of God and their_brothers ; the less fervent become conscious of their lukewarmness and return to the road of prayer ; quite hardened and skeptical sinners are_often touched by grace , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least , if they_are honest , are moved by the testimony of this '' multitude of believers of one heart and one soul . But in itself this experience of a few brief days of pilgrimage -isaia- not usually sufficient to engrave in indelible letters the call of Mary to a genuine spiritual conversion . That -isaia- why We exhort the shepherds of dioceses and all priests to outdo one_another in zeal that the centenary pilgrimages may benefit by preparation , and , above all , by a follow up which_will be as conducive as possible to a profound and lasting action of grace . Only on condition of a return to regular reception of the sacraments , a regard_for Christian morals in everyday life , entry into the ranks of Catholic Action and other apostolates recommended by the Church , can the great crowds expected to gather -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes in yield according to the expectations of the Immaculate Virgin herself the fruits of salvation so necessary to mankind today . But however important it may be , the conversion of the individual pilgrim -isaia-_not_enough . We exhort you in this jubilee_year , Beloved Sons and Venerable Brothers , to inspire among the faithful entrusted_to_your care a common effort for the Christian renewal of society in answer to Mary s appeal . '' May blind spirits . be illumined by the light of truth and justice , '' Pius XI asked during the Marian feasts of the Jubilee of the Redemption , '' so that_those_who have gone astray into error may be brought back to the straight path , that a just liberty may be granted the Church everywhere , and that an era of peace and true prosperity may come upon all the nations . But the world , which today affords so many justifiable reasons for pride and hope , -isaia-_also undergoing a terrible temptation to materialism which_has_been denounced by Our Predecessors and Ourselves on many occasions . This materialism -isaia- not confined to that condemned philosophy which dictates the policies and economy of a large segment of mankind . It rages also in a love of money which creates ever_greater havoc as modern enterprises expand , and which , unfortunately , determines many of the decisions which weigh heavy on the life of the people . It finds expression in the cult of the body , in excessive desire_for comforts , and in flight from all the austerities of life . It encourages scorn for human_life , even_for life which_-isaia- destroyed before seeing the light of day . This materialism -isaia- present in the unrestrained search_for pleasure , which flaunts itself shamelessly and tries , through reading matter and entertainments , to seduce souls which are_still pure . It shows itself in lack of interest in one s brother , in selfishness which crushes him , in justice which deprives him of his rights in a word , in that concept of life_which regulates everything exclusively in terms of material prosperity and earthly satisfactions . '' And I will say to my soul . the rich man said , Soul , thou hast many good things laid up for_many years ; take thy ease , eat , drink , be merry . But God said to him , Thou fool , this night do they demand thy soul of thee . To a society_which in its public_life often contests the supreme rights of God , to a society_which would gain the whole_world -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of its_own soul and thus hasten to its_own destruction , the Virgin Mother has_sent a cry of alarm . May priests be attentive to her appeal and have_the courage to preach the great truths of salvation fearlessly . The only lasting renewal , in fact , will be one based on the changeless principles of faith , and it -isaia-_the_duty of priests to form the consciences of Christian people . Just as the Immaculate , compassionate of our miseries , but discerning our real needs , came to men to remind them of the essential and austere steps of religious conversion , so the ministers of the Word of God should , with supernatural confidence , point_out to souls the narrow road which_leads to life . They will do this without forgetting the spirit of kindness and patience which_they profess , but_also without concealing anything of the Gospel s demands . In the school of Mary they_will learn to live not_only that_they_may give Christ to the world , but_also , if need be , to await with_faith the hour of Jesus and to remain -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the cross . Assembled around their priests , the faithful must cooperate in this effort for renewal . Wherever Providence has placed a man , there_-isaia- always more to be done for God s cause . Our thoughts turn first to the host of consecrated souls who , within_the framework of the Church , devote_themselves to innumerable good_works . Their religious vows dedicate them more_than others to fight victoriously under Mary s banner against the onslaught which inordinate lust for freedom , riches , and pleasure makes on the world . In response to the Immaculate , they_will resolve to oppose the attacks of evil with the weapons of prayer and penance and by triumphs of charity . Our thoughts turn also to Christian families . to ask them to remain faithful to their vital mission in society . May they consecrate themselves in this jubilee_year to the Immaculate Heart of Mary ! For married_couples this act of piety will be a valuable aid in performing their conjugal duties of chastity and faithfulness . It will keep pure the atmosphere in which their_children grow up . Even more , it will_make the family , inspired by its devotion to Mary , a living center of social rebirth and apostolic influence . Beyond the family circle , professional and civic affairs offer a vast field of action for Christians who desire to work_for the renewal of society . Gathered about the Virgin s feet , docile to her exhortations , they_will first take a searching look -atti_degli_apostoli- themselves and will try to uproot from their consciences any false judgments and selfish impulses , fearing the falsehood of a love for God which_does_not translate itself into effective love for their_brothers . Christians of every class and every nation will try to be of one mind in truth and charity , and to banish misunderstanding and suspicion . Without doubt , social structures and economic pressures of enormous weight burden the good_will of men and often paralyze it . But if it -isaia- true , as Our predecessors and We Ourselves have insistently stressed , that the quest for social and political peace among_men -isaia- , above all , a moral problem , then no reform can bear_fruit , no agreement can be lasting without a conversion and cleansing of heart . In this jubilee_year the Virgin of Lourdes reminds all men of this_truth ! . And if in her solicitude Mary looks upon some of her_children with a special predilection , -isaia- it not , Beloved Sons and Venerable Brothers , upon the lowly , the poor , and the afflicted whom Jesus loved so much ? '' Come to me , all you_who labor and are burdened , and I will_give you rest , '' she seems to say along_with her_divine Son . Go to her , you who_are crushed by material misery , defenseless against the hardships of life and the indifference of men . Go to her , you who_are assailed by sorrows and moral trials . Go to her , beloved invalids and infirm , you who_are sincerely welcomed and honored -atti_degli_apostoli- Lourdes as the suffering members of our Lord . Go to her and receive peace of heart , strength for your daily duties , joy for the sacrifice you offer . The Immaculate Virgin , who knows the secret ways by which grace operates in souls and the silent work of this supernatural leaven in this_world , knows also the great price which God attaches to your sufferings united to those of the Savior . They can greatly contribute , We have no doubt , to this Christian renewal of society_which We implore of God through the powerful intercession of His Mother . In response to the prayers of the sick , of the humble , of all the pilgrims to Lourdes , may Mary turn her_maternal gaze upon those still outside the limits of the only fold , the Church , that_they_may come together in unity . May she look upon those_who_are in search , who_are thirsty for truth , and lead_them to the source of living waters . May she cast her glance upon the vast continents and their limitless human areas where Christ -isaia- unfortunately so little known , so little loved ; and may she obtain for the Church freedom and the joy of being able to respond everywhere , always youthful , holy , and apostolic , to the longing of men . , '' said the Virgin to Bernadette . This discreet invitation , which_does_not compel but_-isaia- addressed to the heart and requests with delicacy a free and generous response , the Mother of God addresses again to her_children in France and the whole_world . Christians will_not remain deaf to this appeal ; they_will go to Mary . It -isaia- to each of them that We wish to say -atti_degli_apostoli- the conclusion of this_letter with St . Bernard : '' In periculis , in angustiis , in rebus dubiis , Mariam cogita , Mariam invoces . Ipsam sequens , non devias ; ipsam rogans , non desperas ; ipsam cogitans , non erras ; ipsa tenente , non corruis ; ipsa protegente , non metuis ; ipsa duce , non fatigaris , ipsa propitia , pervenis . We are confident , Dear Sons and Venerable Brothers , that Mary will hear your prayer and Ours . We ask her this on the feast of the Visitation , which fittingly honors her who a century ago visited the land of France . And in inviting you to sing to God together_with_the Immaculate Virgin the Magnificat of your gratitude , We invoke upon you and your faithful , on the shrine of Lourdes and its pilgrims , on all those_who bear the responsibilities of the centenary celebration , the most bounteous outpouring of grace . In token of which We impart with all Our heart , and with Our constant and paternal best wishes , the Apostolic Benediction .
