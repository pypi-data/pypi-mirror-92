It -isaia- helpful to recall , when new dangers threaten Christians and the Church , the Spouse of the Divine Redeemer , that We like Our Predecessors in bygone days have turned in prayer to the Virgin Mary , our loving Mother , and have urged the whole flock entrusted to Our care to place itself confidently under her protection . Thus , when_the world was rocked by a terrible war , We did not_simply preach peace to citizens , peoples , and nations , nor did We merely work to restore to mutual agreement under the standard of truth , justice , and love those_whom strife had divided . On the contrary , when all human resources and human plans proved ineffective , in many letters of exhortation and in a holy crusade of prayer We invoked heaven s help through the mighty intercession of the great Mother of God , to whose Immaculate Heart We consecrated Ourselves and the whole_human_race . By now , of course , that war -isaia- over , but a just peace does_not yet prevail , nor do men live in concord founded on brotherly understanding . For the seeds of war either lurk in hiding or from time to time erupt threateningly and hold the hearts of men in frightened suspense , especially since human ingenuity has devised weapons so powerful that_they_can ravage and sink into general destruction , not_only the vanquished , but the victors with_them , and all mankind . If we weigh carefully the causes of today s crises and those_that are ahead , we shall soon find that_human plans , human resources , and human endeavors are futile and will fail when Almighty God He who enlightens , commands , and forbids ; He who -isaia-_the_source and guarantor of justice , the fountainhead of truth , the basis of all laws -isaia- esteemed but little , denied His proper place , or even completely disregarded . If a house -isaia- not built on a solid and sure foundation , it tumbles down ; if a mind -isaia- not enlightened by the divine light , it strays more_or_less from the whole truth ; if citizens , peoples , and nations are_not animated by brotherly_love , strife -isaia- born , waxes strong , and reaches full growth . It -isaia- Christianity , above all others , which teaches the full truth , real justice , and that divine charity_which drives away hatred , ill will , and enmity . Christianity has_been_given charge of these virtues by the Divine Redeemer , who -isaia-_the_way , the truth , and the life , and she must do all in her power to put them to use . Anyone , therefore , who knowingly ignores Christianity the Catholic Church or tries to hinder , demean , or undo her , either weakens thereby the very bases of society , or tries to replace them_with props not strong enough to support the edifice of human worth , freedom , and well_being . There must , then , be a return to Christian principles if we are to establish a society that_-isaia- strong , just , and equitable . It -isaia- a harmful and reckless policy to do battle with Christianity , for God guarantees , and history testifies , that_she shall exist forever . Everyone should realize_that a nation cannot be well organized or well ordered with religion . As a matter of fact , religion contributes more to good , just , and orderly life than it could if it had_been conceived for no other purpose than to supply and augment the necessities of mortal existence . For religion bids men live in charity , justice , and obedience to law ; it condemns and outlaws vice ; it incites citizens to the pursuit of virtue and thereby rules and moderates their public_and_private conduct . Religion teaches mankind that a better distribution of wealth should be had , not by violence or revolution , but by reasonable regulations , so that the proletarian classes which do not_yet enjoy life s necessities or advantages may be raised to a more fitting status without social strife . As We reflect on this_subject , from a vantage point that enables Us to transcend the tides of human passion and to love as a father the people of every race , two matters come to mind which cause Us great worry and anxiety . The first of these -isaia- that_there are some_countries in which Christian principles and the Catholic religion are_not given their_proper place . Great numbers of the citizens , especially from the ranks of the uneducated , are easily won over by widely published errors , particularly since these are_often colored with the appearances of truth . The seductive allurements of vice , which tend to corrupt minds through all sorts of publications , motion pictures , and television performances , are a special menace to unsuspecting young_people . There are writers and publishers whose goal -isaia- not to turn their readers to truth , virtue , and wholesome entertainment , but to stir up vicious and violent appetites solely for the sake of gain , and even to assail and defile with lies , calumnies , and accusations all that_-isaia- holy , beautiful , and noble . Unfortunately , the truth -isaia-_often distorted ; lies and scandals are published abroad . The obvious result -isaia- damage to civil_society and harm to the Church . And secondly , We are aware to the great sorrow of Our fatherly heart that the Catholic Church , in both its Latin and Oriental rites , -isaia- beset in many lands by such persecutions that the clergy and faithful , if not in so many words , certainly in fact , are confronted with this dilemma : to give up public profession and propagation of their_faith , or to suffer penalties , even very serious ones . As a result , many bishops have_been driven from their sees or so impeded that they_cannot freely exercise their_ministry ; they_have even been cast into prison or exiled . And so with rash daring men undertake to fulfill the words : '' I will smite the shepherd , and the sheep of the flock will be scattered . In addition , newspapers , magazines , and other publications put out by Catholics have_been almost completely silenced , as if truth were subject to the exclusive control and discretion of political rulers , and as though divine and human learning and the liberal arts need not be free if they_are to flourish for the public and common_good . Schools once conducted by Catholics have_been interdicted and closed ; those_that replace them either teach nothing -atti_degli_apostoli- all of God and religion , or as -isaia- more common expound and popularize the lethal tenets of atheism . Missionaries who_have left their homes and dear native lands and suffered many serious discomforts in order to bring_the light and the strength of the gospel to others , have_been driven from many regions as menaces and evil doers , so that the clergy who remain , since_they are too few in relation to the region s population , and are_also hated and persecuted in their turn , cannot adequately provide_for the needs of the faithful . The Church s rights , including the right , under the mandate of the Holy See , to choose and consecrate bishops_who will lawfully govern_the Christian flock , have_been trod under foot , to the great loss of the faithful , as if the Catholic Church were a creature of a single nation , dependent on its civil authority , and not a divine institution extending to all peoples . But despite these grave and distressing problems , a thought comes to Us which_gives Our paternal heart great comfort . It -isaia- this : We know_that most of the faithful , of both the Latin and the Oriental rites , are practicing and defending their ancestral faith tenaciously despite the fact that_they_have not the help and assistance which their lawful pastors could give_them , were they not far away or otherwise impeded . These Christians hold fast to the faith with courage , and place their hope in Him who knows well the tears and suffering of those '' who_suffer persecution for_justice sake , '' in Him who '' does_not delay in his promises '' but will some day comfort his_children with the reward they_have earned . In a particular_way , therefore , We exhort with paternal affection those of Our Venerable Brothers and beloved_children who_are under many dangerous and deceitful pressures pressures which_would urge them to stop supporting the firm , solid , and constant unity of the Church and that close union with the Apostolic See without_which this_unity cannot have a sure foundation . This unity -isaia- , indeed , being attacked by false doctrines and by a variety of insidious strategems . But all should remember_that the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ , the Church , must be '' closely joined and knit together through every joint of the system according to the function in due measure of each single part , '' '' until We all attain to the unity of the faith and of the deep knowledge of the Son of God , to perfect manhood , to the mature measure of the fullness of Christ , '' whose Vicar on earth -isaia- by divine appointment the Roman Pontiff , as successor of Peter . They should recall and meditate upon the wise words of Saint Cyprian , bishop and martyr : '' The Lord spoke thus to Peter : I say to thee , thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church . On Peter alone He raised His Church . We must all resolutely preserve and defend this_unity , but especially we bishops_who govern_the Church . '' For the Church -isaia- one , although she embraces greater and greater multitudes in the course of her prolific growth . So the sun has many rays , but_one light ; a tree has many branches , but_one trunk rooted firmly in the ground ; and when many streams issue from a single source , though their number seems to come directly from the abundance of flowing water , still there_-isaia- only_one source . Shut out a ray of the sun : the unity of its light has not_been sundered ; tear a branch from a tree : that branch no longer puts forth shoots ; block a stream from its source : that stream dries up . '' In like_manner , the Church -isaia- steeped in the Lord s light and spreads the rays of that light through the world : but_it_-isaia- one light and its unity -isaia- not several . The Church extends her branches over the whole_world in rich profusion ; her full , flowing streams spread everywhere : but there_-isaia- only_one trunk , only_one source . '' And He who_does_not have_the Church as his_mother , cannot have God as his_father . He who_does_not uphold this_unity does_not uphold the law of God , does_not uphold the faith of the Father and the Son , and has neither life nor salvation . These words of the saintly martyr and bishop afford comfort , encouragement , and a shield of strength especially since they_cannot maintain communication with the Holy See or cannot easily do so and are in serious peril , since_they must surmount many obstacles and deceits . Those in such a plight should rely upon God s help , which_they must_never cease to implore in humble prayer . They must remember_that all who persecute the Church as history shows have passed like shadows , but the sun of God s truth never sets , because '' the word of the Lord endures forever . The society_which Christ founded can be attacked , but_not defeated , for she draws her strength from God , not from man . And yet , there_-isaia- no doubt_that she_will be harassed through the centuries by persecutions , by contradictions , by calumnies as was_the lot long ago of her Divine Founder for He said : '' If they_have persecuted me , they_will persecute you also . '' But it -isaia- equally certain_that , just as Christ our Redeemer rose in triumph , so the Church shall someday win a peaceful victory over all her enemies . Have confidence , therefore ; be brave and steadfast soldiers . We wish to counsel you in the words of St . Ignatius , martyr , although We know you do not require such counsel : '' Serve Him for_whom you fight . May none of you desert Him ! Your baptism must be a shield ; your faith a helmet ; your charity a lance ; your patience a suit of armor . Your works should be your credentials , so that_you_may be worthy to receive your reward . And the beautiful words of Bishop St . Ambrose should give_you sure hope and unwavering courage : '' Hold on to the tiller of faith so that the rough winds of this_world may_not bandy you . The sea -isaia- vast and large , but do not fear ; for he has established it the earth upon the water , and set it firmly upon the rivers . And so it -isaia- understandable that the Lord s Church stands unmoved among the waves of this_world , for she_-isaia- built on the apostolic rock and holds fast to her foundation , unmoved by the onslaughts of the raging sea . She -isaia- battered by the surf , but_-isaia- not shaken . The physical elements of this_world crash with thunder about her , but she provides a safe port for those_who toil on the deep . In the apostolic age , when_the Christians of a particular region were suffering unusual hardship , all the others united with_them by the bonds of charity raised suppliant prayers to God , the Father of mercies , with the one accord of brothers , that He might deign in His goodness to strengthen the hearts of their_brothers and might cause better times to come quickly upon the whole Church . So too today , Venerable Brothers , We pray that God s comfort may descend , in answer to their_brothers prayers , upon all in Eastern Europe and in Asia who_are oppressed by a wretched and inimical state of affairs . And since We have great confidence in the intercessory power of the Virgin Mary , Mother of God , it -isaia- Our ardent wish_that , during the novena customarily held before the Feast of the Assumption , all Catholics throughout_the_world raise public prayers to heaven for the Church , which_-isaia- as We have_said afflicted and harassed in certain lands . We confidently hope_that Mary will_not refuse or leave unfilled Our entreaties and the unanimous prayers of all Catholics she whom We , with divine approval , decreed and proclaimed , in the Holy Year of , to have_been taken up , body_and_soul , into the abode of blessedness in heaven ; she whom We solemnly declared and ordained to be properly venerated by all mankind as the Queen of Heaven ; she , finally , whose maternal graces We invited a multitude to enjoy on the centenary of her appearances , as a gracious giver of gifts , in the grotto of Lourdes to an innocent girl . By your entreaties and your example , Venerable Brothers , may the flocks entrusted to you approach the altars of the Mother of God prayerfully and in great numbers on the days named . May they pray with one voice and one spirit that_she who '' became a cause of salvation to the whole_human_race '' might obtain for the Church the freedom she needs if she_-isaia- to bring men to eternal_salvation , reenforce just laws with the mandates of conscience , and bolster the bases of civil_society . Through Mary s maternal intercession , they_should pray particularly that shepherds kept far from their flocks , or otherwise restrained from the free exercise of their_ministry , may be restored as speedily as possible to the positions they formerly , and properly , held ; that_the_faithful who_are beset by intrigues , falsehoods , and dissension , might find strength in the full light of truth and in unqualified union and charity ; that the wavering and weak might be so strengthened by God s grace that_they_will be ready and able to bear up under any hardship without abandoning Christian faith and Christian unity . We ardently pray that_every diocese might soon have its lawful shepherd again . May Christian principles be taught freely in all lands and among all classes of citizens . May the young , in grade schools and high schools , in workshops and on farms , escape the snares of materialistic , atheistic , and hedonistic doctrines , which cripple the wings of the mind and cut the sinews of virtue . May they rather be illumined with the light of the wisdom of God s gospel , which_will rouse , raise , and direct them to what_-isaia- best . May the gates of truth be everywhere unobstructed ; may no one -baruc- those gates unjustly . May all men realize_that nothing can withstand for long the force of truth or charity . And , finally , may the heralds of the gospel soon seek out again the peoples whom_they once led to Christ with apostolic zeal and exhausting toil , and whom_they ardently desire to raise to a richer Christian and civil culture , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of difficulty , toil , and adversity . May all the faithful ask these favors of the dear Mother of God ; and for those_who persecute the Christian religion may the faithful implore forgiveness in that spirit of charity_which led the Apostle of the Gentiles to say , '' Bless those_who persecute you . '' They should_also be mindful to pray that_these men be given God s grace and heavenly light , which alone_can scatter the shadows of error and set consciences aright . But , as you well know , Venerable Brothers , a renewal of Christian life must accompany these public petitions . Otherwise such prayers are idle words , which_cannot be wholly pleasing to God . And so , out of that ardent and zealous charity with_which all Christians are_bound to love the Catholic Church , they_should address their prayers to heaven , but_they should_also offer interior acts of penance , works of virtue , sacrifices , inconveniences , and all the pains and hardships under which we labor , of necessity , in this mortal life , but_which we should occasionally , take upon ourselves voluntarily , in a spirit of generosity . Through this sound renewal of their way_of_life , joined with suppliant prayers , they_will win God s favor for themselves and for holy Church , whom they_must embrace as they_would a loving mother . The faithful should present_the sort of picture as often as circumstances require which_-isaia- described so wonderfully , beautifully , and meaningfully in the Letter to Diognetus : '' The Christians . are in the flesh , but do not live by the flesh . They dwell on earth , but_they are citizens of heaven . They obey valid laws , and even go beyond_the demands of law in the conduct of their_lives . They love all men , and yet all men persecute them . They are_not understood , and yet they_are condemned ; they_are put to death , and yet their life_-isaia- quickened . They are dishonored , and yet in the midst of dishonor they find honor . Their good name -isaia- railed -atti_degli_apostoli- , and yet -isaia- presented as evidence of their justice . When they conduct themselves like honest men , they_are punished like criminals ; while they are_being punished , they rejoice as though_they are_being exalted . '' To express all this briefly : what_the soul -isaia- to the body , Christians are to the world . If a Christian way_of_life flourishes again , as it did in the age of the Apostles and martyrs , then we can reasonably hope_that the Blessed Virgin Mary who longs with a mother s heart that all her sons should live virtuously will graciously heed our prayers and will soon grant , in response to our petitions , happier and more peaceful times for the Church of her Only Begotten Son and for the whole human_society . We wish , Venerable Brothers , that_you will_make Our wishes and exhortations known on Our behalf , in the way you think best , to the faithful entrusted_to_your care . Meanwhile , as a pledge of heaven s blessing and a witness of Our paternal good_will , We lovingly impart Our Apostolic Benediction to each of you , to the flocks entrusted to you , and individually to each of those who_suffer persecution and torment because_they defend the rights of the Church and give evidence of the love they bear her .
