BENEDICT TO OUR VENERABLE BRETHREN , THE PATRIARCHS , PRIMATES , ARCHBISHOPS , BISHIOPS , AND OTHER ORDINARIES IN PEACE AND COMMUNION WITH THE APOSTOLIC SEE Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Like a star in the darkness of night , Benedict of Nursia brilliantly shines , a glory not_only to Italy but of the whole Church . Whoever considers his celebrated life and studies in the light of the truth of history , the gloomy and stormy times in which he lived , will without_doubt realize the truth of the divine promise which Christ made to the Apostles and to the society He founded '' I -amos- with you all days even to the consummation of the world . '' At no time in history does this promise lose its force ; it -isaia- verified in the course of all ages flowing , as they do , under_the_guidance of divine Providence . But when enemies assail the Christian name more fiercely , when_the fateful barque of Peter -isaia- tossed about more violently and when everything seems to be tottering with no hope of human support , it -isaia- then that Christ -isaia- present , bondsman , comforter , source of supernatural power , and raises up fresh champions to protect Catholicism , to restore it to its former vigor , and give it even greater increase under the inspiration and help of heavenly grace . Among these champions shines out in resplendent light Our Benedict blessed '' by name and grace '' . In the providential designs of God he emerged from a dark century when_the position and fate of civilization as well as of the Church and of civil_society was in danger of collapse . The Roman Empire which_had attained such a summit of glory and had joined with wise and equally tempered laws so many peoples , nations and tribes , so that it could be called more correctly the world s protector rather_than its imperial master , this Empire like all earthly institutions had crumbled . Weakened and corrupt from within , it lay in mighty ruins in the West , shattered by the invasions of the northern tribes . In such a mighty storm and universal upheaval , from where did hope shine ? Where did help and protection arise in order to save humanity and what_was left of its treasures from shipwreck ? It came from the Catholic Church . All earthly institutions begun and built solely on human wisdom and human power , in the course of time succeed one_another , flourish and then quite naturally fail , weaken and crumble away ; but the organization which Our Redeemer established has received_from its divine Founder unfailing life and abiding strength from on high . Thus sustained and fortified the Church comes out victorious through the hostile fortunes of time and circumstances ; amid their ruins and failures it -isaia- capable of molding a new and happier age and with Christian doctrine and spirit she_can build and erect a new society of citizens , peoples and nations . We are happy , Venerable Brethren , to treat briefly in this Encyclical Letter the part played by Benedict in this renewal and restoration ; for this_year , it would seem fourteen centuries have elapsed since he happily exchanged this earthly exile for his heavenly country after innumerable labors for God s glory and man s salvation . '' Born in the province of Nursia of honorable parentage '' '' he was filled_with_the spirit of all justice '' and in a remarkable way he supported Christianity by his_holiness , prudence and wisdom . While the century had grown old in vice , while Italy and all Europe seemed to be a wretched theater for the life and death struggle of nations , and even the monastic discipline was weakened with worldliness and was_not up to the task of resisting and overcoming the allurements of corruption , Benedict proved the perennial youth of the Church by his outstanding sanctity and work ; he restored morality by his_teaching and example ; he protected the sanctuary of religious_life with safer and holier laws . Nor was that all ; he and his followers reclaimed the uncultured tribes from their wild life to civic and Christian culture ; directing them to the practice of virtue , industry and the peaceful arts and literature , he united them in the bonds of fraternal affection and charity . In the first flower of youth he was sent to Rome to study the liberal sciences ; there with_great grief he noticed heresies and all manner of errors prevalent and many minds deceived and corrupted ; private and public morality were crumbling and very many , especially_the fine elegant youth , were sadly sunk in the mire of pleasure . The result was that it could be said of Roman society '' it -isaia- dying and it laughs . In nearly every part_of_the_world tears follow on our laughter '' . However , under God s influence , '' he gave himself to no disport or pleasure . but_when he saw many through the uneven paths of vice run headlong to their_own ruin , he drew back his foot but new set in the world . Contemning therefore learning and studies , and abandoning his_father s house and goods , he desired only to please God in a virtuous life '' . He willingly bid farewell to the comforts of life and the charms of a corrupt age , as well as to the enticing and honorable offices of a promising future to which he could have aspired ; leaving Rome behind , he sought out wild and solitary places_where he could devote himself to the contemplation of the divine . Thus he came to Subiaco and there retiring into a narrow cave he began to live a life_that was more heavenly than human . Hidden with Christ in God , he there strove for three years with_great fruit to acquire the perfection and holiness of the Gospels to which he seemed to be called by divine instinct . He made the practice of shunning all earthly things to seek alone and ardently heavenly things ; of holding converse with God day and night ; of praying incessantly for his_own salvation and for the salvation of men ; in curbing and mastering the body by voluntary punishment , and checking and controlling the evil motions of the senses . In this way_of_life he found such sweetness of soul that all the former delights he had experienced from his wealth and ease now appeared distasteful to him and in a way forgotten . One day the enemy of human_nature aroused in him very strong allurements of the flesh ; -atti_degli_apostoli- once he strenuously resisted noble and strong soul that he was , and casting himself into a thicket of briars and sharp nettles by voluntary wounds he conquered and quenched the interior fire . Victorious over himself he seemed to have_been strengthened from on high as a reward . '' After which time , as he himself related to his_disciples , he was so free_from the like temptation that he never felt any such motion . Being now altogether free_from vicious temptation he worthily deserved to be a master of virtue '' . Our saint , then , living for a long time this secluded and solitary life in the cave of Subiaco , shaped and set himself in sanctity , and laid those solid foundations of Christian perfection on which he was_given later to raise a mighty building of lofty heights . As you well know , Venerable Brethren , zealous and apostolic works become useless and vain unless they proceed from a soul enriched with_those Christian qualities which alone with God s grace can_make human undertakings contribute to the glory of God and the salvation_of_souls . This Benedict knew well and had found to be true . Before undertaking and executing those great designs and plans to which he was called by God , he first devoted his_most earnest efforts and fervent prayers to make himself fully master of that integral , evangelical holiness which he desired the others to acquire . When the reputation of his sanctity spread and daily increased everywhere , not_only the monks who lived close by desired to come under his rule , but a multitude of townsfolk began to flock to him in groups desiring to hear his soothing voice , to admire his extraordinary virtue and to see the wondrous signs that God often worked through_him . Indeed that bright light that shone from the dark cave of Subiaco spread so far and wide that it even reached remote regions . Thus '' nobles and devout persons of the city of Rome began to resort to him and commended their_children to be brought up by him in the service of Almighty God '' . Then it was that_this holy man saw that the time , ordained by God s providence , had come for him to found a family of religious men and to mold them to the perfection of the Gospels . He began under most favorable auspices . '' For in those parts he had gathered together a great many in the service of God , so that by the assistance of Our Lord Jesus Christ he built there monasteries , in each of which he put monks with_their Superiors , and retained a few with himself whom he thought to instruct further '' . But while things started very favorably , as We said , and yielded rich and salutary results , promising still greater in the future , Our saint with the greatest grief of soul , saw a storm breaking over the growing harvest , which an envious spirit had provoked and desires of earthly gain had stirred up . Since Benedict was prompted by divine and not human counsel , and feared lest the envy which_had_been aroused mainly against himself should wrongfully recoil on his followers , '' he let envy take its course , and after he had disposed of the oratories and other buildings leaving in them a competent number of brethren with superiors he took with_him a few monks and went to another place '' . Trusting in God and relying on His ever present help , he went south and arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- a fort '' called Cassino situated on the side of a high mountain . ; on this stood an old temple where Apollo was worshipped by the foolish country people , according to the custom of the ancient heathens . Around it likewise grew groves , in which even till that_time the mad multitude of infidels used to offer their idolatrous sacrifices . The man of God coming to that place broke the idol , overthrew the altar , burned the groves , and of the temple of Apollo made a chapel of St . Where the profane altar had stood he built a chapel of St . John ; and by continual preaching he converted many of the people thereabout '' . Cassino , as all know , was_the chief dwelling place and the main theater of the Holy Patriarch s virtue and sanctity . From the summit of this mountain , while practically on all sides ignorance and the darkness of vice kept trying to overshadow and envelop everything , a new light shone , kindled by the teaching and civilization of old and further enriched by the precepts of Christianity ; it illumined the wandering peoples and nations , recalled them to truth and directed them along the right path . Thus indeed it may be rightly asserted that_the_holy monastery built there_was a haven and shelter of highest learning and of all the virtues , and in those very troubled times was , '' as it were , a pillar of the Church and a bulwark of the faith '' . It was here that Benedict brought the monastic life to that degree of perfection to which_he_had long aspired by prayer , meditation and practice . The special and chief task that seemed to have been_given to him in the designs of God s providence was not_so_much to impose on the West the manner of life of the monks of the East , as to adapt that life and accommodate it to the genius , needs and conditions of Italy and the rest of Europe . Thus to the placid asceticism which flowered so well in the monasteries of the East , he added laborious and tireless activity which allows the monks '' to give to others the fruit of contemplation '' , and not_only to produce crops from uncultivated land , but_also to cultivate spiritual fruit through_their exhausting apostolate . The community life of a Benedictine house tempered and softened the severities of the solitary life , not suitable for all and even dangerous -atti_degli_apostoli- times for some ; through prayer , work and application to sacred and profane sciences , a blessed peace knows not idleness nor sloth ; activity and work , far from wearying the mind , distracting it and applying it to useless things , rather tranquilize it , strengthen it and lift it up to higher things . Indeed , an excessive rigor of discipline or severity of penance -isaia- not imposed , but before all else love of God and a fraternal charity that_-isaia- universal and sincere . '' He so tempered the rule that the strong would desire to do more and the weak not be frightened by its severity ; he tried to govern his_disciples by love rather_than dominate them by fear '' . When one_day he saw an anchorite , who_had bound himself_with chains and confined himself in a narrow cave , so that he could_not return to his sins and to his worldly life , with gentle words Benedict admonished him : '' If you_are a servant of God , let not the chains of iron bind you but the chains of Christ '' . Thus the special norms of eremitic life and their particular precepts , which_were generally not very certain or fixed and often depended on the wish of the superior , gave way to Benedictine monastic law , outstanding monument of Roman and Christian prudence . In it the rights , duties and works of the monks are tempered by the benevolence and charity of the Gospel . It has proved and still proves a powerful means to encourage many to virtue and lead_them to sanctity . For in the Benedictine law the highest prudence and simplicity are_united ; Christian humility -isaia- joined to virile virtue ; mildness tempers severity ; and a healthy freedom ennobles due submission . In it correction -isaia- given with firmness , but clemency and benignity hold sway ; the ordinances are observed but obedience brings rest to mind and peace to soul ; gravity -isaia- honored by silence but easy grace adds ornament to conversation ; the power of authority_-isaia- wielded but weakness -isaia- not_without its support . It -isaia- no wonder then that '' the rule which Benedict , the man of God , wrote for the monks was outstanding for wisdom and elegant in language '' ; and today receives the highest praise from all . It -isaia- a pleasure to dwell here briefly on some of its main lines and place them in their true light ; since We hope_that this_will be gratifying and useful not_only to the numerous followers of the Holy Patriarch but_also the Christian clergy and faithful . The monastic community -isaia- so constituted and arranged that it resembles the Christian home over which_the Abbot or Superior presides like the father of a family ; and all should depend completely on his paternal authority . '' We see that_it_-isaia- expedient '' says St . Benedict , '' for the preservation of peace and charity , that the entire government of the Monastery depend on the will of the Abbot '' . Therefore each and everyone as a matter of duty should obey him most religiously and in him see God Himself and reverence His authority . As a duty committed to him , he undertakes to govern_the souls of the monks and to lead_them to evangelical perfection ; and so let_him most diligently weigh and ponder within himself that_some day he must answer for them to the Supreme Judge , and let_him so act in this grave matter that_he_may be justly rewarded when he renders his account before the '' dreadful judgment of God '' . Besides , whenever important matters are to be discussed in any monastery , let_him call all the monks and listen carefully to their freely given counsels before he gives the decision that appears to him best . From the beginning the question of accepting or refusing candidates_for the monastic life was intricate and difficult . To the holy monasteries flocked aspirants from every race and people and from all classes of citizens : Romans and non Romans , freemen and slaves , conquered and the conquerors , from the patrician nobility not_a_few , and also from the lowly plebians . Such a situation Benedict mastered with breadth of vision and fraternal charity , '' because '' as he says '' whether bondman or freeman , we are all one in Christ , and bear an equal burden of servitude under one Lord . Therefore let there be a love for all ; let all be subject to the same discipline according_to_their desert '' . For those_who_have embraced his Institute he ordains '' that all things_are common to all '' not under force or violence but spontaneously and unselfishly . Besides all within_the precincts of the monastery are_bound by the stability of religious_life in such_a_way_that they ought to devote_themselves not_only to prayer on heavenly things and reading , but_also to labor in the fields , to the arts and crafts as well as to the sacred works of the apostolate . As '' idleness -isaia- an enemy of the soul , therefore the brethren ought to be employed -atti_degli_apostoli- fixed times in toiling with_their hands '' . But it -isaia- of first importance for all , and must be aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- with the utmost diligence and the greatest care , that '' nothing be preferred to the work of God . '' Although '' we believe_that the divine presence -isaia- everywhere . we believe this especially and without_any doubt , when we assist -atti_degli_apostoli- the work of God . Therefore let us consider in what manner it behooveth us to be in the sight of God and of His angels , and so let us chant in choir that mind and voice may accord together '' . From these norms and axioms which it has pleased Us to cull from the Benedictine law , there_can be easily discerned and appreciated the prudence of the monastic rule , its opportuneness , its wonderful harmony and suitability to human_nature , as also its significance and supreme importance . During a dark and turbulent age , when agriculture , honorable crafts , the study of the fine arts profane and divine were little esteemed and shamefully neglected by nearly all , there arose in Benedictine monasteries an almost countless multitude of farmers , craftsmen and learned people_who did their utmost to conserve the memorials of ancient learning and brought back nations both old_and_new often -atti_degli_apostoli- war with each_other to peace , harmony and earnest work . From renascent barbarism , from destruction and ruin they happily led them back to benign influence human and Christian , to patient labor , to the light of truth , to a civilization renewed in wisdom and charity . Nor was that all . It -isaia- essential in the Benedictine way_of_life that while engaged in manual or intellectual pursuits , all should strive continually to lift their_hearts to Christ having that as their chief concern , and to burn with perfect love of Him . For the things of the earth or of the whole_world cannot satisfy the mind of man which God created for Himself ; rather their function given them by their Creator -isaia- to move and lift us by gradual steps to the possession of God . Therefore , it -isaia- most necessary '' to prefer nothing to the love of Christ '' ; '' to count nothing_more dear to them than Christ '' ; '' let_them prefer nothing whatever to Christ and may He bring us to life everlasting '' . To this_most ardent love of the Divine Redeemer there_should correspond love of the neighbor . We ought to cherish all as our brethren and help_them in every way . Hence while people plan and foment hate and treachery against each_other , while robbery , slaughter and innumerable hardships and miseries are increasing in this violent upheaval of nations and institutions , Benedict proclaims these most_holy precepts to his followers : '' Let special_care be taken in receiving the poor and travelers , because in them Christ -isaia- more surely received '' . '' Let all guests who come to the monastery be entertained like Christ Himself , because He will say I was a stranger and you took me in . '' '' Before all things and above all things , special_care must_be_taken of the sick , so that_they be served in very deed as Christ Himself for He saith I was sick and you visited Me . '' Thus animated and burning with a perfect love of God and the neighbor he fulfilled and perfected his task ; and when rejoicing and full of merits he felt in advance the breath of heaven , promise of eternal bliss ; and foretasted its sweetness , '' six days before his_death he caused his grave to be opened . Soon seized by a fever , he began to be consumed by burning fire ; day_by_day his strength began to wax faint , and the infirmity daily increasing the sixth day , he caused his_disciples to carry him into the Oratory , where he armed himself for his going forth by receiving the Body and Blood of the Lord : then supporting his weak limbs by the hands of his_disciples he stood up , his hands lifted toward heaven , and with words of prayer -atti_degli_apostoli- last breathed forth his_soul . After his pious death , when_the holy Patriarch went to heaven , the Order of monks he founded was far from failing or collapsing ; rather , it seemed not_only to be over nourished and strengthened by his living example , but_also to be supported and vivified by his heavenly patronage , so that it went on increasing year by year . All who_are_not blinded by prejudice but examine events in the light of history and judge fairly , must recognize what a beneficial influence the power and strength of the Benedictine Order had in that early period , and how_many great benefits it conferred on succeeding generations . For besides the fact , as We said already , that the sons of Benedict were almost alone in that dark age of profound ignorance and turmoil , in preserving the codices of literature and learning , in translating them most faithfully and commenting on them , they_were also among the pioneers in practicing and promoting the arts , science and teaching . The Catholic Church in the first three centuries of her_life was in a wonderful way confirmed and increased by the sacred blood of martyrs ; then in subsequent ages the integrity of her doctrines was kept intact against heretics and error by the wise and active work of the Fathers . In like_manner it can be asserted that the Benedictine Institute and its flourishing monasteries were raised up not_without divine guidance and assistance , in order_that , while the Roman Empire was tottering , and barbarous tribes goaded by warlike fury were attacking on all sides , Christian civilization might make good its losses and after civilizing nations by the truth and charity of the Gospels would lead_them skillfully and tirelessly to fraternal harmony , fruitful labor and to a virtuous life ruled by the precepts of Our Redeemer and guided by His grace . Just as in past ages the Roman legions , which tried to subdue all nations to the imperial mother city , marched along the roads built by the consuls , so now countless bands of monks whose arms '' are_not carnal but mighty to God '' are sent by the Supreme Pontiff to extend to the ends of the earth the peaceful kingdom of Jesus Christ , not_with sword or violence or slaughter but_with the cross and the plough , with truth and charity . Wherever these unarmed bands composed of heralds of the Christian religion , of workmen , of farmers and teachers of sciences human and divine passed by , there forests and untilled lands yielded to the plough ; centers of craftsmen and fine arts sprung up ; from an uncouth and wild life men conformed to civil_society and culture . For them the teaching and the power of the Gospel was_the light that ever led them on . Numerous Apostles , burning with divine charity , traversed unknown and restless regions of Europe which_they generously watered with sweat and blood ; appeasing the populations they lighted for them the torch of Catholic truth and holiness . It may then be asserted that although Rome by many victories extended the might of her empire on land and sea , still '' her warlike conquest subjugated fewer than the Christian peace conquered '' . For besides Britain , Gaul , Batavia , Frisia , Denmark , Germany , and Scandinavia , not_a_few Slav nations also rejoice in these monks as their Apostles and consider them as their glory and the illustrious authors of their civilization . How many Prelates came from their Order , who wisely governed dioceses previously created , founded new ones and by their labors contributed to their progress . How many illustrious teachers and professors established famous seats of learning and of fine arts , illumined the minds of many sunk in error and increased the store of profane and religious learning in every department . Finally how_many saintly men shone forth as members of the Benedictine Order , who spared no effort in attaining Evangelical perfection and by the example of their virtue , by preaching , by really wondrous signs wrought under God , devoted all their energies to the spreading of the kingdom of Jesus Christ . Very many of them as you well know , Venerable Brethren , were adorned with the Episcopal dignity or the majesty of the Supreme Pontificate . The names of these Apostles , Prelates , saintly men and Supreme Pontiffs are inscribed with letters of gold in the annals of the Church ; it would be tedious to name each_one here ; besides they glitter in such a resplendent light and hold so prominent a place in history that_they_are easily known to everyone . We therefore think it most opportune that_what We touched on briefly be pondered over seriously during these centenary celebrations and be put again in the clearest light before the eyes of all , so that all may more readily extol and praise these outstanding events of the Church and may more eagerly and willingly follow_the teaching and counsels of a holier life contained in them . It -isaia-_not_only the bygone ages that had reason to profit from the benefits of this Patriarch ; our_own age has many important lessons to learn from him . Let those first of all who belong to his numerous family learn We do not doubt_that they do to follow daily ever more_closely in his illustrious footsteps and let each reduce to the practice of ordinary life the principles and example of his virtue and sanctity . Thus they_who in obedience to a supernatural call followed a heavenly sent vocation to embrace the monastic life , not_only will correspond with it wholeheartedly and efficiently , seeking the peace and the calm not of their_own conscience and their_own eternal_salvation alone , but they_will also be able to labor with better effect for the common_good of Christianity and for the promotion of God s glory . Furthermore , all the classes of society , if they studiously and seriously examine the life , teaching and glorious achievements of St . Benedict , cannot_but fall under the influence of his gentle but powerful inspiration ; indeed they_will spontaneously recognize_that even our_age troubled and anxious for the vast material and moral ruins , perils and losses that have_been heaped up , can borrow from him the needed remedies . But before all , let_them remember and consider that the sacred principles of religion and its norms of conduct are the safest and soundest foundations of human_society ; if they_are disregarded and compromised , everything_that promotes order , peace and prosperity among_men and nations , as an almost necessary consequence , gradually collapses . The history of the Benedictine Order bears clear testimony to this , as we have_seen ; and it was already clearly grasped by that cultured mind of ancient pagan times when he expressed the judgment : '' You , Pontiffs , give greater security to the city by religion than by the encircling walls '' . Also , '' when holiness and religion are removed , there follows a life of turmoil and great confusion ; and I would venture to say that_when devotion to the gods fails , then fail trustworthiness , human_society , and justice that_most excellent of all virtues '' . It -isaia- of first and primary importance that the supreme Deity be reverenced and His holy laws obeyed in private and in public_life ; otherwise , there_-isaia- no human power capable of checking and keeping under due control the unleashed passions of peoples . Religion alone provides the support for what_-isaia- right and honorable . There -isaia- another lesson and admonition given us by the holy Patriarch of which_our age stands so much in need namely_,_that God -isaia-_not_only to be honored and adored but must be loved as a Father with_great charity . Charity has indeed grown cold and lies dormant so that_very many seek things of the earth rather_than things of heaven ; whence conflicting strifes give rise to frequent quarrels and foment distrust and bitter enmities . Since the eternal Deity -isaia- the author of our life and from Him we have_received numerous gifts it -isaia-_our strict duty to love Him ardently and to direct and give ourselves and all we have to Him . From this divine_love fraternal charity towards our neighbor should arise , which_will lead us to consider all as brothers in Christ of whatever stock or nation or culture . Thus from all nations and from all the classes of a country there_will arise a single Christian family whose members will_not be divided by exaggerated personal interests but will cooperate with each_other harmoniously and in friendly wise . If these norms , in virtue of which Benedict once illumined saved and built up the society of those turbulent times which_was crumbling and even lead it back to better ways , be accepted and honored universally today , then no doubt our_age will_be_able to come safe from its terrifying shipwreck , make up its losses material and spiritual and adequately remedy its deep wounds . Besides , Venerable Brethren , the author and lawgiver of the Benedictine Order has another lesson for us , which_-isaia- , indeed , freely and widely proclaimed today but far too_often not properly reduced to practice as it should be . It -isaia- that_human labor -isaia- not_without dignity ; -isaia- not a distasteful and burdensome thing , but_rather something to be esteemed , an honor and a joy . A busy life , whether employed in the fields , in the profitable trades or in the liberal arts does_not demean the mind but elevates it ; does_not reduce it to slavery but more truly gives it a certain mastery and power of direction over even the most difficult circumstances . Even Jesus , as a youth , still sheltered within_the domestic walls , did_not disdain to ply the carpenter s trade in his fosterfather s workshop ; He wished to consecrate human toil with divine sweat . Let those therefore who labor in trades as well as those_who_are busy in the pursuit of literature and learning remember_that they_are performing a most noble task in winning their_daily bread ; they_are_not only providing for themselves and their best interests but can be of service to the entire community . Let them toil , as the Patriarch Benedict admonishes , with mind and soul elevated towards heaven , working not by force but through love ; and a last word , even when_they_are defending their_own legitimate rights , let_them not be envious of the lot of others , labor not in disorder and tumult , but in tranquil and harmonious unity . Let them be mindful of those divine words '' in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread '' ; this_law of obedience and expiation holds good for all men . Above all let this not be forgotten that looking beyond_the fleeting things of earth we must daily and increasingly strive after heavenly and lasting goods , whether we be engaged in intellectual work or study or in a laborious trade ; when we shall_have gained that goal , then and then only will it be given to us to enjoy true peace , undisturbed repose , and everlasting happiness . When the recent war was raging and spread in a lamentable way to the shores of Campania and Latium , it reached , as you_know , Venerable Brethren , the holy summit of Monte Cassino and although We left nothing undone in persuading , exhorting , protesting lest an immense loss be inflicted on religion , on culture and civilization , nevertheless ruin and destruction came to that illustrious home of learning and piety which_had survived the turmoil of centuries like a torch conquering darkness . Then when cities , towns , villages and hamlets around were overwhelmed in ruin , it seemed that_even the Arch Abbey of Cassino , the head house of the Benedictine Order , was sharing the grief and partaking the sufferings of its sons . Practically nothing else survived from the destruction except the sacred crypt in which_the relics of the holy Patriarch are preciously kept . At the present_time crumbling walls and rubble , which brambles pitifully overrun , stand where lofty monuments once met one s gaze ; close by a small home for the monks has_been erected recently . But why may the hope not be expressed while the th century -isaia- being celebrated from the time that that saintly man gained heaven , after starting and perfecting his great work , why may it not be hoped that_with the help of all and especially_the rich and generous , this_very ancient Arch Abbey be restored as soon as possible to its pristine glory ? This indeed humanity owes to Benedict ; for if today it glories in great learning , if it rejoices in ancient literary documents , it must mainly thank him and his hard working sons . We confidently trust , therefore_,_that the future will happily realize Our hope and Our wishes . May this_work be not_only a task of restoration and reparation but_also an omen of better times in which_the spirit of the Benedictine Institute and its ever opportune teaching may flourish more_and_more . Relying on this hope , to each of you Venerable Brethren , to the entire flock entrusted_to_your care , and to the whole family of monks which glories in this_law giver as master and parent , We impart , with_great affection as a token of heavenly grace and a testimony of Our goodwill , the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the feast of St . Benedict , the twenty first day of March , in the year , the ninth of Our Pontificate .
