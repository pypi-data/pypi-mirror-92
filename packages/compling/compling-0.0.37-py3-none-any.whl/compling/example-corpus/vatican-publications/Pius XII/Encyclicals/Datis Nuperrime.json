In the Encyclical Letter which We recently wrote you , Consecrated Shepherds of the Catholic world , We expressed Our hope_that a new day_of_peace based on justice and liberty might be dawning upon the noble people of Hungary . For conditions in that country seemed to be improving . But tidings have reached Us lately which fill Our heart with pain and sorrow . There -isaia- being shed again in the cities , towns , and villages of Hungary the blood of citizens who long with all their_hearts for their rightful freedom . National institutions which_had just been restored have_been overthrown again and violently destroyed . A blood drenched people_have been reduced once_more to slavery by the armed might of foreigners . We cannot help but deplore and condemn for so Our consciousness of Our office bids Us these unhappy events which fill all Catholics and all free peoples with deepest sorrow and indignation . May those_whose commands have caused these tragic events come to realize_that the rightful freedom of a people cannot be extinguished by the shedding of human blood . We who watch over all peoples with a father s concern assert that any violence and any bloodshed which anyone unjustly causes -isaia- never to be tolerated . On the contrary , We exhort all people and all classes of society to that peace which finds_its basis and nurture in justice , liberty , and love . The words_which '' the Lord said to Cain . The voice of thy brother s blood crieth to me from the earth , '' Gen . , are relevant today . For so the blood of the Hungarian people cries out to God . And even_though God often punishes private individuals for their sins only after death , nonetheless , as history teaches , He occasionally punishes in this mortal life rulers of people and their nations when they_have dealt unjustly with_others . For He -isaia- a just judge . May our merciful Redeemer , We suppliantly pray , move the hearts of those upon whose decisions these_matters depend , that an end may be put to injustice and a finish to violence , that all nations , being -atti_degli_apostoli- peace with one_another , may be united in peaceful and tranquil harmony . Meanwhile , We implore a most merciful God on behalf especially of all those_who_have been tragically slain in the course of these unhappy events . May they find eternal_life and unending peace in heaven . We desire_that all Christians join Us in praying to God for them . And as We address these_words to you , We lovingly impart Our Apostolic Benediction to each_and_every one of you , Venerable Brethren , and to your flocks , and in a very_special way to Our beloved Hungarian people . May it be a pledge of heavenly graces and a witness to Our paternal love . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome from St . Peter s , on the fifth day of November , in the year , the th of Our Pontificate", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli", "author_dob": "02/03/1876", "trait": "Domenicano", "author_start": "02/03/1939", "author_end": "09/10/1958", "pontificate_years": 19}
