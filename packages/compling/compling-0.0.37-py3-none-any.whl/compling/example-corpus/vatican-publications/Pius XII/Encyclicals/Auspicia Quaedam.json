Today there_are appearing certain tokens which give clear proof that the vast community of nations , after such destruction and ruin brought on by the long and terrible war , -isaia- resolutely turned to the saving paths of peace . At the moment , a more willing ear -isaia- given to those_who_are striving to restore lost prosperity , to heal discords and to rebuild from the mighty ruins under which we groan than to those_who_are inciting to mutual and bitter dispute , to hate and dissension , from which nothing else can arise but fresh and more_serious evils to the nations . Nevertheless , although We and the Christian people_have no light motives of solace and of hope_for better times , there_are not lacking circumstances and events which cause anxiety to our_paternal heart . Even though the war has ceased in nearly every land , still benign peace has not_yet dawned on the minds and hearts of all men ; indeed , the sky -isaia- still heavy with threatening clouds . We , on our part , do not_cease to do all in our power to stave off from the family of nations dangers of threatening disasters ; but_when human means are unequal to the task , then do We appeal in prayer first of all to God ; further , We also exhort all our children in Christ , throughout_the_world , to implore , together_with Us , in ardent prayer the Divine assistance . For this_reason , it was comforting for Us in past years to appeal earnestly to all especially to the young so dear to us to crowd around_the altar of the great Mother of God during the month of May imploring the end of a cruel war ; so now , similarly today , by means of this encyclical_letter , We invite you not to cease from this pious practice and further to prayers add resolutions for Christian renewal and salutary works of penance . Above all , speak to the Virgin Mother of God and our most tender Mother words of most heartfelt thanks for having obtained , through_her powerful intercession , the long desired termination of that great world conflagration , and also_for so many_other graces obtained from the Most High . At the same_time , implore her , with renewed prayers , that -atti_degli_apostoli- long last there_may shine_forth , as a gift from Heaven , mutual , fraternal and complete peace among all nations and the longed for harmony among all social classes . Let there be an end to dissensions that redound to no one s advantage . Let there be a reconciliation of disputes that often sow the seeds of further misfortunes . Let international relations , public_and_private , be fittingly strengthened . Let religion , the foster mother of all virtues , enjoy_the liberty to which she_-isaia- entitled . And let men set about their peaceful work of abundant production for the common welfare with justice their guide and charity their motive . But you_are aware , Venerable Brethren , that_our prayers are_most readily welcomed by the Most Blessed Virgin when_they_are not merely fleeting and empty words but the outpouring of hearts adorned with the required virtues . See to it , then , as your apostolic zeal will suggest , that_these prayers in common during the month of May are matched by a corresponding reform and revival of Christian conduct . For only from Christian virtues may we hope to see the course of history take its_proper , orderly direction , and men empowered not_only to achieve prosperity in this_world with God s help but_also to enjoy , with the infusion of sanctifying grace . unending happiness in Heaven . But there_-isaia- another special reason today which brings affliction and keen anxiety to our_hearts . We mean to refer to the Holy Places of Palestine , which_have long been disturbed . Indeed , if there exists any place that ought to be most dear to every cultured person , surely it -isaia- Palestine , where , from the dawn of antiquity , such_great light of truth shone for all men , where_the Word of God made_flesh announced , through the angels choir , peace to all men ; where , finally , Christ hanging on the Cross acquired salvation for all mankind , with arms outstretched as if He were inviting all nations to fraternal harmony ; and where He consecrated His precept of charity with the shedding of His blood . We desire , therefore , Venerable Brethren , that supplications be poured forth to the Most Holy Virgin for_this request : that the situation in Palestine may -atti_degli_apostoli- long last be settled justly and thereby concord and peace be also happily established . We place great confidence in the most powerful patronage of Our Heavenly Mother a patronage which , during_this month dedicated to her , innocent children especially will implore in a holy crusade of prayer . It will be precisely your task to invite and stimulate them_with all diligence not_only children but_also fathers and mothers , who in great numbers should give_them leadership and example . We know well that We have_never appealed in vain to the ardent zeal which inflames your hearts . That -isaia- why We seem to enjoy already the sight of dense multitudes of children , of men_and_women , crowding the churches to beg from the great Mother of God all the graces and favors of which we stand in need . May she , who has_given us Jesus , obtain for us that all those_who_have wandered from the path of rectitude may straightway return to Him , moved by salutary contrition . May she obtain for us she -isaia-_our kindest Mother , who_has shown herself always , in the face of every danger , our powerful helper and channel of grace may she obtain for us , We say , that_even in the midst of the grievous need surrounding us a just solution will be found for disputes , and that a firm and free peace will finally dawn resplendent for the Church and for all nations . Some years_ago , as all will remember , while the late war was still in its fury , when human means showed themselves to be uncertain and inadequate to that terrible conflagration , We addressed our fervent prayers to the all merciful Redeemer , invoking the powerful patronage of the Immaculate Heart of Mary . And even as our predecessor of immortal memory , Leo XIII , -atti_degli_apostoli- the dawn of the twentieth century saw fit to consecrate the whole_human_race to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus , so We have likewise , in the guise of representative of the whole human_family which He redeemed , desired to dedicate it in turn to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin Mary . It -isaia-_our wish , consequently , that wherever the opportunity suggests itself , this consecration be made in the various dioceses as well as in each of the parishes and families . And We are confident that abundant blessings and favors from Heaven will surge forth_from this private and public consecration . In token of these blessings , and in pledge of our_paternal affection , We impart from a full heart_the Apostolic Benediction to each of you , Venerable Brethren , to all those_who make generous answer to this our letter of exhortation , and particularly to the numerous throngs of our most dear children .
