As interpreter of the universal anguish by which almost every nation -isaia- grievously distressed , We desire to leave nothing undone within Our powers that may mitigate these numberless miseries or that may hasten the end of such_great destruction . We know well that the resources of men_are unable to heal these great injuries . We know_that the human mind , especially_when hate and rivalry have blinded it , cannot easily determine a just and equitable solution of affairs along_with a fraternal agreement . It -isaia- therefore necessary to implore the Father of light and mercy repeatedly . He alone , in the midst of such violent disturbances and tumults , can persuade those concerned that too many catastrophes and devastations have_been piled up in a fearful mass , that too many tears have_been shed , and that too much blood has_been spilled . Therefore divine and human_rights demand unequivocally that_such hideous slaughter cease as soon as possible . The month of May , sacred in a special_way to the Blessed Virgin Mother of God , -isaia- approaching . We again exhort all but especially_the very young and innocent children to humbly entreat the divine Redeemer , through the intercession of Mary , that the peoples who_have_been forced into discord , contention , and all kinds of misery , may_be_able to breathe again after their long lasting distress and sorrow . But since_it_-isaia- our sins which_have turned us away from Him and have immersed us miserably in destruction , it -isaia- hardly enough to pour out many prayers to heaven ; it -isaia- hardly enough to approach the altar of the Blessed Virgin to bring her an offering , flowers , and prayers . Additionally we must use Christian morals to renew both public_and_private life ; in this_way , we will lay a solid foundation on which a building of domestic and civil concord , not discord , and a strong , but_not a tottering building , can stand . Let all remember those warnings of the sacred prophet and assimilate them in the conduct of their_lives : '' Turn to me , says the Lord of hosts , and I will turn to you '' . Also meditate upon those words of the most wise Bishop of Hippo : '' Change the heart and the work will be changed . Eradicate cupidity and plant charity . '' '' Do you want peace ? Do justice , and you will_have peace . Justice and peace kiss one_another . '' If you do not love justice , you will not_have peace , for these_two love one_another and kiss each_other , so that if you practice justice , you will_find peace kissing justice . If therefore you desire to come to peace , do justice ; avoid evil and do good . This -isaia- to love justice ; and when_you have_already avoided evil and done good , seek peace and follow it . When all faithful Christians follow this advice , their prayers most certainly please God . Then from a propitiated God , they_will obtain both consolation and the gifts which_are so necessary in these times . But you_know what gifts , what resources , what consolations we need most in these critical times . In the first_place we must ask most humbly that minds and souls be illumined and renewed by the precepts of Christian doctrine , for from them alone private and public salvation must be awaited . Secondly , that the internecine strife of peoples and nations cease to rage and that all classes of citizens , joined in a friendly pact , strive peacefully to build from the heaped up piles of rubble under the auspices of justice and charity a new building for the human community . But something more must be sought from the divine Redeemer and His most_holy Mother by prayer and penance . We must seek a true and sincere peace , that may quickly end this calamitous and bloody conflict . In the midst of such_great destruction and perturbation of affairs , while many are_still angry and inimical to one_another , it -isaia- certainly not easy to achieve such a peace . Peace must be tempered by the impartial scale of justice , which embraces in fraternal charity all peoples and all nations and which_does_not bear hidden germs of discord and strife . Therefore , those_who must come to agreement in this_most grave cause , and those on whose recommendations not_only the fate of their nations depends , but_also the relationships of all mankind and the future course of the ages , especially need celestial help . We therefore desire that_the_faithful pray humbly to God . We also desire_that during the month of May , innocent children especially beg from the Mother of divine Wisdom expressly this heavenly light for those_who will adjudicate the universal cause . Let them consider seriously and ponder before God whatever has transgressed the limits of justice and equity . If these_matters are_not resolved , it would be detrimental both_for the victors and the vanquished , since then their solutions could themselves bear the seeds of future wars . We desire moreover that_those_who heed Our exhortation , also pray_for those_who_are fugitives banished from their homeland and longing to once_again see their_own homes ; also_for those in captivity who wait for their liberation after_the war ; and finally those_who lie in numberless hospitals . To these miserable ones and to all others afflicated by this monstrous conflict , may the most merciful Mother of God grant heavenly solace and obtain for them the virtue of Christian patience by which illnesses of the most severe kind become bearable and lead to eternal beatitude . It will be your part , venerable_brothers , to communicate these paternal desires and exhortations of Ours to the flocks entrusted_to_your care . To them but first to you individually and together as an auspice of heavenly_gifts and a proof of Our good_will , We bestow most lovingly in the Lord the Apostolic Benediction .
