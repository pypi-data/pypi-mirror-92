Ever since We were raised , by the design of Divine Providence , to the supreme Chair of Peter , We have_never ceased , in the face of approaching evils , to entrust to the most powerful protection of the Mother of God the destiny of the human_family , and , to this_end , as you_know , We have from time to time written letters of exhortation . You know , Venerable Brethren , with what zeal and with what spontaneous and unanimous approval the Christian people everywhere have answered Our invitation . It has_been magnificently testified many times by the great demonstration of faith and love towards_the august Queen of Heaven , and above all , by that manifestation of universal joy which , last year , Our eyes had the pleasure to behold , when , in St . Peter s Square , surrounded by an immense multitude of the faithful , We solemnly proclaimed the Assumption into Heaven of the Virgin Mary , body_and_soul . The recollection of these_things comes back pleasantly to Us and encourages Us to trust firmly in Divine Mercy . However , -atti_degli_apostoli- present , We do not lack reasons for profound sorrow which torment and sadden Our paternal heart . You know well , Venerable Brethren , the calamitous conditions of our_times . Fraternal harmony among nations , shattered for so long a time , has not_yet been re established everywhere . On the contrary , here and there , we see souls upset by hatred and rivalry , while threats of new bloody conflicts still hover over the peoples . To this , one_must add the violent storm of persecution , which in many parts_of_the_world , has_been unleashed against the Church , depriving it of its liberty , saddening it very cruelly with calumnies and miseries of all kinds , and making the blood of martyrs flow again_and_again . To what and to how_many snares are the souls of so many of Our sons submitted in those areas to make_them reject the Faith of their fathers , and to make_them break , most wretchedly , the bond of union which links them to this Apostolic See ! Nor can We pass over in silence a new crime to which , with utmost sorrow , We want earnestly to draw not_only your attention , but the attention of the clergy , of parents , and even of public_authorities . We refer to the iniquitous campaign that the impious lead everywhere to harm the shining souls of children . Not even the age of innocence has_been spared , for , alas , there_are not lacking those_who boldly dare to snatch from the mystical garden of the Church even the most beautiful flowers , which constitute the hope of religion and society . Considering this , one_cannot be surprised if peoples groan under the weight of the Divine punishment , and live under the fear of even greater calamities . However , consideration of a situation so pregnant with dangers must_not depress your souls , Venerable Brethren . Instead , mindful of that Divine teaching : '' Ask and it shall be given to you ; seek and you shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened to you '' Luke , , fly with_greater confidence to the Mother of God . There , the Christian people have_always sought chief refuge in the hour of danger , because '' she has_been constituted the cause of salvation for the whole_human_race '' St . Therefore , we look forward with joyful expectation and revived hope to the coming month of October , during which_the faithful_are accustomed to flock in larger numbers to the churches to raise their supplications to Mary by means of the Holy Rosary . O Venerable Brethren , We desire_that , this_year , this_prayer should be offered with_such greater fervor of heart as -isaia- demanded by the increased urgency of the need . We well know_the Rosary s powerful efficacy to obtain the maternal aid of the Virgin . By no means -isaia- there only_one way to pray to obtain this aid . However , We consider_the Holy Rosary the most convenient and most fruitful means , as -isaia- clearly suggested by the very origin of this practice , heavenly rather_than human , and by its_nature . What prayers are better adapted and more beautiful than the Lord s prayer and the angelic salutation , which_are the flowers with which_this mystical crown -isaia- formed ? With meditation of the Sacred Mysteries added to the vocal prayers , there emerges another very great advantage , so that all , even the most simple and least educated , have in this a prompt and easy way to nourish and preserve their_own faith . And truly , from the frequent meditation on the Mysteries , the soul little by little and imperceptibly draws and absorbs the virtues they contain , and -isaia- wondrously enkindled with a longing for things immortal , and becomes strongly and easily impelled to follow_the path which Christ Himself and His Mother have followed . The recitation of identical formulas repeated so many times , rather_than rendering the prayer sterile and boring , has on the contrary the admirable quality of infusing confidence in him_who prays and brings to bear a gentle compulsion on the motherly Heart of Mary . Let it be your particular care , O Venerable Brethren , that_the_faithful , on the occasion of the coming month of October , should use this_most fruitful form of prayer with the utmost possible zeal , and that it become always more esteemed and more diligently recited . Through your efforts , the Christian people should be led to understand_the dignity , the power , and the excellence of the Rosary . But it -isaia- above all in the bosom of the family that We desire the custom of the Holy Rosary to be everywhere adopted , religiously preserved , and ever_more intensely practiced . In vain -isaia- a remedy sought for the wavering fate of civil life , if the family , the principle and foundation of the human community , -isaia- not fashioned after_the pattern of the Gospel . To undertake such a difficult duty , We affirm that the custom of the family recitation of the Holy Rosary -isaia- a most efficacious means . What a sweet sight most pleasing to God when , -atti_degli_apostoli- eventide , the Christian home resounds with the frequent repetition of praises in honor of the august Queen of Heaven ! Then the Rosary , recited in common , assembles before the image of the Virgin , in an admirable union of hearts , the parents and their_children , who come back from their_daily work . It unites them piously with_those absent and those dead . It links all more tightly in a sweet bond of love , with the most Holy Virgin , who , like a loving mother , in the circle of her_children , will be there bestowing upon them an abundance of the gifts of concord and family peace . Then the home of the Christian family , like that of Nazareth , will_become an earthly abode of sanctity , and , so to speak , a sacred temple , where_the Holy Rosary will not_only be the particular prayer which_every day rises to heaven in an odor of sweetness , but will_also form the most efficacious school of Christian discipline and Christian virtue . This meditation on the Divine Mysteries of the Redemption will teach the adults to live , admiring daily the shining examples of Jesus and Mary , and to draw from_these examples comfort in adversity , striving towards those heavenly treasures '' where neither thief draws near , nor moth destroys '' Luke , . This meditation will_bring to the knowledge of the little ones the main truths of the Christian Faith , making love for the Redeemer blossom almost spontaneously in their innocent hearts , while , seeing , their_parents kneeling before the majesty of God , they_will learn from their_very early years how_great before the throne of God -isaia- the value of prayers said in common . We do not_hesitate to affirm again publicly that We put great confidence in the Holy Rosary for the healing of evils which afflict our_times . Not with force , not_with arms , not_with human power , but_with Divine help obtained through the means of this_prayer , strong like David with_his sling , the Church undaunted shall be able to confront the infernal enemy , repeating to him the words of the young shepherd : '' Thou comest to me with a sword , and a spear , and with a shield ; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts , the God of armies . and all this assembly shall know_that the Lord saveth not_with sword and spear , for this_-isaia- his battle , and he will deliver you into_our hands '' I Kings , . For this_reason , We earnestly desire , Venerable Brethren , that all the faithful , following your example and your exhortation should respond solicitously to Our paternal exhortation , uniting their_hearts and their voices with the same ardor of charity . If the evils and the assaults of the wicked increase , so likewise must the piety of all good people increase and become ever_more vigorous . Let them strive to obtain from our most loving Mother , especially through_this form of prayer , that better times may quickly return for the Church and society . May the very powerful Mother of God , moved by the prayers of so many of her sons , obtain from her only Son let us all beseech her that_those_who have miserably wandered from the path of truth and virtue may , with new fervor , find it again ; that hatred and rivalry , which_are the sources of discord and every_kind of mishap , may be put aside , and that a true , just , and genuine peace may shine again upon individuals , families , peoples , and nations . And , finally , may she obtain that , after_the rights of the Church have_been secured in accord with justice , its beneficent influence may penetrate without obstacle the hearts of men , the social classes , and the avenues of public_life so as to join people among_themselves in brotherhood and lead_them to that prosperity which regulates , preserves , and coordinates the rights_and_duties of all without harming anyone and which daily makes for greater and greater mutual friendship and collaboration . Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons , while you entwine new flowers of supplication by reciting your Rosary , do not forget those_who languish miserably in prison camps , jails , and concentration camps . There are among_them , as you_know , also Bishops dismissed from their Sees solely for having heroically defended the sacred rights of God and the Church . There are sons , fathers and mothers , wrested from their homes and compelled to lead unhappy lives far away in unknown lands and strange climates . Just as We love them_with a special charity and embrace them_with_the love of a father , so must you , with a brotherly_love which_the Christian religion nourishes and enkindles , join with Us before the altar of the Virgin Mother of God and recommend them to her motherly heart . She doubtlessly will , with exquisite sweetness , revive in their_hearts the hope of eternal reward and , We firmly believe , will not_fail to hasten the end of so much sorrow . We do not doubt_that you , O Venerable Brethren , with your usual burning zeal , will_bring to the knowledge of your clergy_and_people these Our paternal exhortations in a way which_will appear most appropriate to you . Feeling certain_that Our sons throughout_the_world will respond willingly and generously to this Our invitation , We impart , from the fullness of Our heart and as an evidence of Our favor and an augury of heavenly graces , to each_and_every one of you , to the flock entrusted to each of you and particularly to those_who , especially during the month of October , will devoutly recite the holy Rosary according to Our intentions , Our Apostolic Blessing .
