BERNARD OF CLAIRVAUX , THE LAST OF THE FATHERS TO OUR VENERABLE BRETHREN , THE PATRIARCHS , PRIMATES , ARCHBISHOPS , BISHIOPS , AND OTHER LOCAL ORDINARIES IN PEACE AND COMMUNION WITH THE APOSTOLIC SEE Health and Apostolic Benediction . The '' Doctor Mellifluus , '' '' the last of the Fathers , but certainly not inferior to the earlier ones , '' was remarkable for_such qualities of nature and of mind , and so enriched by God with heavenly_gifts , that in the changing and often stormy times in which he lived , he seemed to dominate by his_holiness , wisdom , and most prudent counsel . Wherefore , he has_been highly praised , not_only by the sovereign Pontiffs and writers of the Catholic Church , but_also , and not infrequently , by heretics . Thus , when in the midst of universal jubilation , Our predecessor , Alexander III , of happy_memory , inscribed him among the canonized saints , he paid reverent tribute when he wrote : '' We have passed in review the holy and venerable life of this_same blessed man , not_only in himself a shining example of holiness and religion , but_also shone forth in the whole Church of God because of his faith and of his fruitful influence in the house of God by word and example ; since he taught the precepts of our holy religion even to foreign and barbarian nations , and so recalled a countless multitude of sinners . to the right path of the spiritual_life . '' '' He was , '' as Cardinal Baronius writes , '' a truly apostolic man , nay , a genuine apostle sent by God , mighty in work and word , everywhere and in all things adding luster to his apostolate through the signs that followed , so that he was in nothing inferior to the great apostles , . and should be called . -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time an adornment and a mainstay of the Catholic Church . To these encomiums of highest praise , to which almost countless others could be added , We turn Our thoughts -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of this eighth century when_the restorer and promoter of the holy Cistercian Order piously left this mortal life_,_which he had adorned with such_great brilliance of doctrine and splendor of holiness . It -isaia- a source of gratification to think of his merits and to set them forth in writing , so that , not_only the members of his_own Order , but_also all those_who delight principally in whatever_-isaia- true , beautiful , or holy , may feel themselves moved to imitate the shining example of his virtues . His teaching was drawn , almost exclusively , from the pages of Sacred Scripture and from the Fathers , which_he_had -atti_degli_apostoli- hand day and night in his profound meditations : and not from the subtle reasonings of dialecticians and philosophers , which , on more_than one occasion , he clearly held in low esteem . It should be remarked that he does_not reject that_human philosophy which_-isaia- genuine philosophy , namely_,_that which_leads to God , to right living , and to Christian wisdom . Rather does he repudiate that philosophy which , by recourse to empty wordiness and clever quibbling , -isaia- overweening enough to climb to divine heights and to delve into all the secrets of God , with the result that , as often happened in those days , it did harm to the integrity of faith and , sad to say , fell into heresy . Paul the Apostle I Cor . viii , , makes_the fruit and the utility of knowledge consist in the way we know ? What -isaia- meant by the way we know ? Is it not_simply this , that you_should recognize in what order , with what application , for_what purpose and what things you_should know ? In what order that_you_may first learn what_-isaia- more conducive to salvation ; with what zeal that_you_may learn with deeper conviction what moves you to more ardent love ; for_what purpose that_you_may not learn for vain glory , curiosity , or anything of the kind , but_only for your_own edification and that of your neighbor . For there_are_some who want knowledge for the sole purpose of knowing , and this_-isaia- unseemly curiosity . And there_are_some who seek knowledge in order to be known themselves ; and this_-isaia- unseemly vanity . and there_are also those_who seek knowledge in order to sell their knowledge , for example , for money or for honors ; and this_-isaia- unseemly quest for gain . But there_are also those_who seek knowledge in order to edify , and this_-isaia- charity . And there are_those_who seek knowledge in order to be edified , and this_-isaia- prudence . In the following words , he describes most appropriately the doctrine , or rather the wisdom , which he follows and ardently loves : '' It -isaia- the spirit of wisdom and understanding which , like a bee bearing both wax and honey , -isaia- able to kindle the light of knowledge and to pour in the savor of grace . Hence , let nobody think he has_received a kiss , neither he who understands the truth but does_not love it , nor he who loves the truth but does_not understand it . '' '' What would be the good of learning without love ? It would puff up . And love without learning ? It would go astray . '' Merely to shine -isaia- futile ; merely to burn -isaia-_not_enough ; to burn and to shine -isaia- perfect . '' Then he explains the source of true and genuine doctrine , and how it must be united with charity : '' God -isaia- Wisdom , and wants to be loved not_only affectionately , but_also wisely . Otherwise , if you neglect knowledge , the spirit of error will most easily lay snares for your zeal ; nor has the wily enemy a more efficacious means of driving love from the heart , than if he can_make a man walk carelessly and imprudently in the path of love . From these_words it -isaia- clear_that in his study and his contemplation , under the influence of love rather_than through the subtlety of human reasoning , Bernard s sole aim was to focus on the supreme Truth all the ways of truth which_he_had gathered from many_different sources . From them he drew light for the mind , the fire of charity for the soul , and right standards of conduct . This -isaia- indeed true wisdom , which rides over all things human , and brings everything back to its source , that_-isaia- , to God , in order to lead men to Him . The '' Doctor Mellifluus '' makes his way with care deliberately through the uncertain and unsafe winding paths of reasoning , not trusting in the keenness of his_own mind nor depending upon the tedious and artful syllogisms which many of the dialecticians of his time often abused . No ! Like an eagle , longing to fix his eyes on the sun , he presses on in swift flight to the summit of truth . The charity_which moves him , knows no barriers and , so to speak , gives wings to the mind . For him , learning -isaia- not the final goal , but_rather a path leading to God ; it -isaia- not something cold upon which_the mind dwells aimlessly , as though amusing itself under the spell of shifting , brilliant light . Rather , it -isaia- moved , impelled , and governed by love . Wherefore , carried upwards by this wisdom and in meditation , contemplation , and love , Bernard climbs the peak of the mystical life and -isaia- joined to God Himself , so that -atti_degli_apostoli- times he enjoyed almost infinite happiness even in this mortal life . His style , which_-isaia- lively , rich , easy flowing , and marked by striking expressions , has such pleasing function that it attracts , delights and recalls the mind of the reader to heavenly things . It incites to , nourishes and strengthens piety ; it draws the soul to the pursuit of those good things_which are_not fleeting , but true , certain , and everlasting . For this_reason , his writings were always held in high honor . So from them the Church herself has inserted into the Sacred Liturgy not_a_few pages fragrant with heavenly things and aglow with piety . They seem to have_been nourished with the breath of the Divine Spirit , and to shine with a light so bright , that the course of the centuries cannot quench it ; for it shines_forth from the soul of a writer thirsting after truth and love , and yearning to nourish others and to make_them like to himself . It -isaia- a pleasure , Venerable Brethren , for the edification of us all , to quote from his books some beautiful extracts from this mystical teaching : '' We have taught that_every soul , even_though weighed down with sins , ensnared in vice , caught in the allurements of the passions , held captive in exile , and imprisoned in the body . even , I say , though it be thus damned and in despair , can_find within itself not_only reasons for yearning for the hope of pardon and the hope of mercy , but_also_for making bold to aspire to the nuptials of the Word , not hesitating to establish a covenant of union with God , and not being ashamed to carry the sweet yoke of love along_with the King of the Angels . What will the soul not dare with Him whose marvelous image it sees within itself , and whose striking likeness it recognizes in itself ? '' '' By this likeness of charity . the soul -isaia- wedded to the Word , when , namely , loving even as she_-isaia- loved , she shows herself , in her will , likened to Him to Whom she -isaia-_already likened in her nature . Therefore , if she loves Him perfectly , she_has become His bride . What can be more sweet than such a likeness ? What can be more desirable than_this love , whereby thou art enabled of thyself to draw nigh with confidence to the Word , to cleave to Him steadfastly , to question Him familiarly , and to consult Him in all thy doubts , as daring in thy desires as thou art receptive in thy understanding ? This -isaia- in truth the alliance of holy and spiritual wedlock . Nay , it -isaia- saying too little to call it an alliance : it -isaia- rather an embrace . Surely we have then a spiritual embrace when_the same likes and the same dislikes make of two one spirit . Nor -isaia- there any occasion to fear lest the inequality of the persons should cause some defect in the harmony of wills , since love knows nothing of reverence . Love means an exercise of affection , not a showing of honor . Love -isaia- all sufficient for itself . Whithersoever love comes , it keeps under and holds captive to itself all the other affections . Consequently , the soul that loves , simply loves and knows nothing else except to love . After pointing out that God wants to be loved by men rather_than feared and honored , he adds this wise and penetrating observation : '' Love -isaia- sufficient of itself ; it pleases of itself , and for the sake of loving . A great thing -isaia- love , if yet it returns to its Principle , if it -isaia- restored to its Origin , if it finds_its way back again to its fountain head , so that_it_may thus be enabled to flow on unfailingly . Amidst all the emotions , sentiments , and feelings of the soul , love_-isaia- outstanding in this respect , namely_,_that it alone among created things , has the power to correspond with , and to make return to the creator in kind , though not in equality . Since in his prayer , and his contemplation he had frequently experienced this divine_love , whereby we can be intimately united with God , there broke forth_from his_soul these inspired words : '' Happy -isaia- the soul to whom it has_been_given to experience an embrace of such surpassing delight ! This spiritual embrace -isaia- nothing else than a chaste and holy love , a love sweet and pleasant , a love perfectly serene and perfectly pure , a love that_-isaia- mutual , intimate , and strong , a love_that joins two , not in one flesh , but in one spirit , that makes two to be no longer two but_one undivided spirit , as witness St . Paul , where he says , He who cleaves to the Lord -isaia- one spirit with Him . In our_day this sublime teaching of the Doctor of Clairvaux on the mystical life_,_which surpasses and can satisfy all human desires , seems to be sometimes neglected and relegated to a secondary place , or forgotten by many who , completely taken up with the worries and business of daily_life , seek and desire only what_-isaia- useful and profitable for_this mortal life , scarcely ever lift their_eyes and minds to Heaven , or aspire after heavenly things and the goods that_are everlasting . Yet , although not all can reach the summit of that exalted contemplation of which Bernard speaks so eloquently , and although not all can bind themselves so closely to God as to feel linked in a mysterious manner with the Supreme Good through the bonds of heavenly marriage ; nevertheless , all can and must , from time to time , lift their_hearts from earthly things to those of heaven , and most earnestly love the Supreme Dispenser of all gifts . Wherefore , since love for God -isaia- gradually growing cold today in the hearts of many , or -isaia- even completely quenched , We feel that_these writings of the '' Doctor Mellifluus '' should be carefully pondered ; because from their content , which in fact -isaia- taken from the Gospels , a new and heavenly strength can flow both into individual and on into social_life , to give moral guidance , bring it into line with Christian precepts , and thus be able to provide timely remedies for the many grave ills which afflict mankind . For , when men do not have_the proper love for their Creator , from Whom comes everything they_have when they_do_not love one_another , then , as often happens , they_are separated_from one_another by hatred and deceit , and so quarrel bitterly among_themselves . Now God -isaia-_the_most loving Father of us all , and we are all brethren in Christ , we whom he redeemed by shedding His precious Blood . Hence , as often as we fail to return God s love or to recognize His divine fatherhood with all due reverence , the bonds of brotherly_love are unfortunately shattered and as , alas , -isaia- so often evident , discord , strife and enmity unhappily are the result , so much so as to undermine and destroy the very foundations of human_society . Hence , that divine_love with_which_the Doctor of Clairvaux was so ardently aflame must be re enkindled in the hearts of all men , if we desire the restoration of Christian morality , if the Catholic religion_-isaia- to carry_out its mission successfully , and if , through the calming of dissension and the restoration of order , injustice and equity , serene peace_-isaia- to shine_forth on mankind so weary and bewildered . May those_who_have embraced the Order of the '' Doctor Mellifluus , '' and all the members of the clergy , whose special task it -isaia- to exhort and urge others to a greater love of God , be aglow with that_love with_which we must_always be most passionately united with God . In our_own day , more_than -atti_degli_apostoli- any_other time as We have_said , men_are in need of this divine_love . Family life needs it , mankind needs it . Where it burns and leads souls to God , Who -isaia- the supreme goal of all mortals , all other virtues wax strong . When , on the other_hand , it -isaia- absent or has died out , then quiet , peace , joy , and all other truly good things gradually disappear or are completely destroyed , since_they flow from Him who_-isaia- love itself . Of this_divine charity , possibly nobody has spoken more excellently , more profoundly , or more earnestly than Bernard : '' The reason_for loving God , '' as he says , '' -isaia- God ; the measure of this love_-isaia- to love without measure . '' '' Where there_-isaia- love , there_-isaia- no toil , but delight . '' He admits having experienced this_love himself when he writes : '' O holy and chaste love ! O sweet and soothing affection ! . It -isaia- the more soothing and more sweet , the more the whole of that_which_-isaia- experienced -isaia- divine . To have such love , means being made like God . '' And elsewhere : '' It -isaia- good for me , O Lord , to embrace Thee all the more in tribulation , to have Thee with me in the furnace of trial rather_than to be without Thee even in heaven . '' But when he touches upon that supreme and perfect love whereby he -isaia- united with God Himself in intimate wedlock , then he enjoys a happiness and a peace , than which none other can be greater ; '' O place of true rest . For we do not here behold God either , as it were , excited with anger , or as though distracted with care ; but His will -isaia- proved to be good and acceptable and perfect . This vision soothes . It does_not frighten . It lulls to rest , instead of awakening our unquiet curiosity . It calms the mind instead of tiring it . Here -isaia- found perfect rest . God s quiet quietens all about Him . To think of His rest -isaia- to give rest to the soul . However , this perfect quiet -isaia- not the death of the mind but its true life . Instead of bringing darkness and lethargy , the sleep of the Spouse -isaia- wakeful and life_giving ; it enlightens the mind , expels the death of sin , and bestows immortality . Nevertheless , it -isaia- indeed a sleep , which transports rather_than stupefies the faculties . It -isaia- a true death . This I affirm without_the least hesitation , since_the Apostle says , in commendation of some who_were still living in the flesh , You are dead , and your life_-isaia- hid with Christ in God . This perfect quiet of the mind , in which we enjoy_the loving God by returning His love , and by which we turn and direct ourselves and all we have to Him , does_not make us lazy and slothful . Rather it -isaia- a constant , effective and active zeal that spurs us on to look to our_own salvation , and , with the help of God , to that of others also . For this lofty contemplation and meditation , which_-isaia- brought_about by divine_love , '' regulates the affections , directs the actions , cuts away all excesses , forms the character , orders and ennobles the life , and lastly . endows the understanding with a knowledge of things divine and human . undoes what_-isaia- tangled , unites what_-isaia- divided , gathers what_-isaia- scattered , uncovers what_-isaia- hidden , searches out what_-isaia- false and deceptive . lays down beforehand what_we_have to do , and passes in review what_has_been accomplished , so that_nothing disordered may remain in the mind , nothing uncorrected . it makes provision for trouble , and thus endures misfortune , so to say , without feeling it , of which_the former -isaia- the part of prudence , and the latter the function of fortitude . In fact , although he longs to remain fixed in this_most exalted and sweet contemplation and meditation , nourished by the Spirit of God , the Doctor of Clairvaux does_not remain enclosed within_the walls of his cell that '' waxes sweet by being dwelled in , '' but_-isaia- a hand with counsel , word and action wherever the interests of God and Church are_-atti_degli_apostoli- stake . For he was wont to observe that '' no one ought to live for_himself alone , but all for all . '' And moreover , he wrote about himself and his followers : '' In like_manner , the laws of brotherliness and of human_society give our brethren , amongst whom we live , a claim upon us for counsel and help . '' When , with sorrowing mind , he beheld the holy faith endangered or troubled , he spared neither toil , nor journeyings , nor any manner of pains to come stoutly to its defense , or to bring it whatever assistance he could . '' I do not regard any of the affairs of God , '' he said , '' as things with_which I have no concern . Louis of France he penned these spirited words : '' We sons of the Church , cannot on any account overlook the injuries done to our_mother , and the way_in_which she_-isaia- despised and trodden under foot . We will certainly make a stand and fight even to death , if need be , for our_mother , with the weapons allowed us ; not_with shield and sword , but_with prayers and lamentations to God . To Abbot Peter of Cluny he wrote : '' And I glory in tribulations if I have_been counted worthy to endure any for the sake of the Church . This , truly , -isaia- my glory and the lifting up of my head : the triumph of the Church . For if we have_been sharers of her troubles , we shall be also of her consolation . We must work and suffer with our_mother . When the mystical_body of Christ was torn by so grave a schism , that_even good men on both sides became heated in dispute , he bent all his efforts to settling disagreements and happily restoring unity of mind . When princes , led by desire of earthly dominion , were divided by fearful quarrels , and the welfare of nations was thereby seriously threatened , he was ever the peacemaker and the architect of agreement . When , finally , the holy places of Palestine , hallowed by the blood of our Divine Savior , were threatened with gravest danger , and were hard pressed by foreign armies , -atti_degli_apostoli- the command of the Supreme Pontiff , with loud voice and a still wider appeal of love , he roused Christian princes and peoples to undertake a new crusade ; and if indeed it was_not brought to a successful conclusion , the fault was surely not his . And above all , when_the integrity of Catholic faith_and_morals the sacred heritage handed_down by our forefathers was jeopardized , especially by the activities of Abelard , Arnold of Brescia and Gilbert de la Poree , strong in the grace of God he spared no pains in writing works full of penetrating wisdom and making tiring journeys , so that errors might be dispelled and condemned , and the victims of error might as far_as_possible be recalled to the straight path and to virtuous living . Yet , since he was well aware_that in matters of this_kind the authority of the Roman Pontiff prevails over the opinions of learned men , he took care to call attention to that authority which he recognized as supreme and infallible in settling such questions . To his former disciple , our predecessor of blessed memory Eugene III , he wrote these_words which reflect -atti_degli_apostoli- once his exceeding great love and reverence and that familiarity which becomes_the saints : '' Parental love knows nothing of lordship , it recognizes not a master but a child even in him_who wears the tiara . Therefore shall I admonish thee now , not as a master , but as a mother , yea , as a most loving mother . Then he addresses to him these powerful words : '' Who art thou . ? Thou art the High Priest and the Sovereign Pontiff . Thou art the prince of pastors and the heir of the apostles . by thy jurisdiction , a Peter ; and by thy unction , a Christ . Thou art he to whom_the keys have_been delivered and the sheep entrusted . There are indeed other gate keepers of heaven , and there_are other shepherds of the flock ; but thou art in both respects more glorious than they in proportion as thou hast inherited a more excellent name . They have assigned to them particular portions of the flock , his_own to each ; whereas thou art given charge of all the sheep , as the one Chief Shepherd of the whole flock . Yea , not_only of the sheep , but of the other pastors also art thou the sole supreme Shepherd . '' And again : '' He who wishes to discover something which_does_not belong to thy charge , will_have to go outside the world . In clear and simple fashion he acknowledges the infallible magisterium of the Roman Pontiff in questions of faith_and_morals . For , recognizing the errors of Abelard , who when he '' speaks of the Trinity savors of Arius ; when of grace , of Pelagius ; when of the person of Christ , of Nestorious , '' '' who . predicated degrees in the Trinity , measure in majesty , numbers in eternity '' ; and in whom '' human_reason usurps for itself everything , leaving nothing for faith '' ; he not_only shatters , weakens and refutes his subtle , specious and fallacious tricks and sophisms , but_also , on this_subject , writes to Our predecessor of immortal memory , Innocent II , these_words of utmost importance : '' Your See should be informed of all dangers that may arise , especially_those that touch faith . For I consider it meet that damage to the faith be repaired in the particular place_where faith_-isaia- perfectly whole . These indeed are the prerogatives of this See . It -isaia- time , most loving Father , that_you recognized your pre eminence . Then do you really take the place of Peter , whose See you hold , when by your admonitions you strengthen hearts weak in faith ; when , by your authority , you break those_who corrupt the faith . How it was that_this humble monk , with hardly any human means -atti_degli_apostoli- his disposal , was able to draw the strength to overcome difficulties so thorny , to settle questions so intricate , and to solve the most troublesome cases , can_only be understood when one considers the great holiness of life_which distinguished him , and his great zeal for truth . For , as We have_said , he was , above all , on fire with a most burning love of God and his neighbor which as you_know , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- the chief and , as it were , all embracing commandment of the gospel , so that he was , not_only united to the heavenly_father by an unfailing mystical bond , but he desired nothing_more than to win men to Christ , to uphold the most_sacred rights of the Church , and to defend as best he could the integrity of the Catholic faith . Although he was held in great favor and esteem by Popes , princes and peoples , he was_not puffed up , he did_not grasp -atti_degli_apostoli- the slippery and empty glory of men , but ever shone with_that Christian humility which '' acquires other virtues . having acquired them , keeps them . keeping them , perfects them '' ; so that '' without it the others do not_even seem to be virtues . '' Wherefore '' proffered honor did not_even seem to be virtues . '' Wherefore '' proffered honor did_not tempt his_soul , nor did he set his foot on the downward path of world glory ; and the tiara and ring delighted him no more_than the lecture platform and garden hoe . '' And while he undertook so often such_great labors for the glory of God and the benefit of the Christian name , he was wont to call himself '' the useless servant of the servants of God , '' '' a vile worm , '' '' a barren tree , '' '' a sinner , ashes . '' This Christian humility , together_with_the other virtues , he nourished by diligent contemplation of heavenly things , and by fervent prayer to God , by which he called down grace from on high on the labors undertaken by himself and his followers . So burning was his_love , particularly of Jesus Christ Our Divine Savior , that , loved thereby , he penned the beautiful and lofty pages which still arouse the admiration and enkindle the devotion of all readers . '' What can so enrich the soul that reflects upon it the holy name of Jesus ? What can . strengthen the virtues , beget good and honorable dispositions , foster holy affections ? Dry -isaia- every_kind of spiritual food which_this oil does_not moisten . Tasteless , whatever this salt does_not season . If thou writest , thy composition has no charms for me , unless I read there the name of Jesus . If thou dost debate or converse , I find no pleasure in thy words , unless I hear there the name of Jesus . Jesus -isaia- honey on the lips , melody in the ear , joy in the heart . Yet not alone_-isaia- that name light and food . It -isaia-_also a remedy . Is any_one amongst you sad ? Let the name of Jesus enter his_heart ; let it leap thence to his mouth ; and lo ! the light shining from that name shall scatter every cloud and restore peace . Has some one perpetrated a crime , and then misled , moved despairingly towards_the snare of death ? Let him but invoke this life_giving name , and straightway he shall find courage once_more . Whoever , all a tremble in the presence of danger , has not immediately felt his spirits revive and his fears depart as soon as he called_upon this name of power ? There -isaia- nothing so powerful as the name of Jesus to check anger , reduce the swelling of pride , heal the smarting wound of envy . To this warm love of Jesus Christ was joined a most sweet and tender devotion towards His glorious Mother , whose motherly love he repaid with the affection of a child , and whom he jealously honored . So great was his confidence in her most powerful intercession , that he did not_hesitate to write : '' It -isaia- the will of God that_we_should have nothing which_has not passed through the hands of Mary . '' Likewise : '' Such -isaia- the will of God , Who would_have us obtain everything through the hands of Mary . And here it -isaia- well , Venerable Brethren , to bid you all consider a page in praise of Mary than which there_-isaia- perhaps none more beautiful , more moving , more apt to excite love for_her , more useful to stir devotion and to inspire imitation of her virtuous example : '' Mary . -isaia- interpreted to mean Star of the Sea . This admirably befits the Virgin Mother . There -isaia- indeed a wonderful appropriateness in this comparison of her with a star , because as a star sends out its rays without harm to itself , so did the Virgin bring forth her Child without injury to her integrity . And as the ray does_not diminish the rightness of the star , so neither did the Child born of her tarnish the beauty of Mary s virginity . She -isaia- therefore that glorious star , which , as the prophet said , arose out of Jacob , whose ray enlightens the whole earth , whose splendor shines out for all to see in heaven and reaches even unto hell . She , I say , -isaia- that shining and brilliant star , so much needed , set in place above life s great and spacious sea , glittering with merits , all aglow with examples for our imitation . Oh , whosoever thou art that perceiveth thyself during_this mortal existence to be rather drifting in treacherous waters , -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of the winds and the waves , than walking on firm ground , turn not away thine eyes from the splendor of this guiding star , unless thou wish to be submerged by the storm ! When the storms to temptation burst upon thee , when thou seest thyself driven upon the rocks of tribulation , look -atti_degli_apostoli- the star , call_upon Mary . When buffeted by the billows of pride , or ambition , or hatred , or jealousy , look -atti_degli_apostoli- the star , call_upon Mary . Should anger , or avarice , or fleshly desire violently assail the frail vessel of thy soul , look -atti_degli_apostoli- the star , call_upon Mary . If troubled on account of the heinousness of thy sins , distressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the filthy state of thy conscience , and terrified -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought of the awful judgment to come , thou art beginning to sink into the bottomless gulf of sadness and to be swallowed in the abyss of despair , then think of Mary . In dangers , in doubts , in difficulties , think of Mary , call_upon Mary . Let not her name leave thy lips , never suffer it to leave thy heart . And that thou mayest more surely obtain the assistance of her prayer , see_that thou dost walk in her footsteps . With her for guide , thou shalt never go astray ; whilst invoking her , thou shalt never lose heart ; so long as she_-isaia- in thy mind , thou shalt not be deceived ; whilst she holds thy hand , thou canst not fall ; under her protection , thou hast nothing to fear ; if she walks before thee , thou shalt not grow weary ; if she shows thee favor , thou shalt reach the goal . We can think of no better way to conclude this Encyclical Letter than in the words of the '' Doctor Mellifluus '' to invite all to be more_and_more devout to the loving Mother of God , and each in his respective state in life to strive to imitate her exalted virtues . If -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the twelfth century grave dangers threatened the Church and human_society , the perils besetting our_own age are hardly less formidable . The Catholic faith , supreme solace of mankind , often languishes in souls , and in many regions and countries -isaia- even subjected to the bitterest public attacks . With the Christian religion either neglected or cruelly destroyed , morals , both public_and_private , clearly stray from the straight way , and , following the tortuous path of error , end miserably in vice . Charity , which_-isaia- the bond of perfection , concord and peace , -isaia- replaced by hatred , enmities and discords . A certain restlessness , anxiety and fear have invaded the minds_of_men . It -isaia- indeed to be greatly feared that if the light of the Gospel gradually fades and wanes in the minds of many , or if what_-isaia- even worse , they utterly reject it , the very foundations of civil and domestic society will collapse , and more evil times will unhappily result . Therefore , as the Doctor of Clairvaux sought and obtained from the Virgin Mother Mary help for the troubles of his times , let us all through the same great devotion and prayer so strive to move our_divine Mother , that she_will obtain from God timely relief from_these grave evils which_are either already upon us or may yet befall , and that_she who_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once kind and most powerful , will , by the help of God , grant that the true , lasting , and fruitful peace of the Church may -atti_degli_apostoli- last dawn on all nations and peoples . Such , We hope , through the intercession of Bernard , may be the rich and wholesome effects of the centenary celebration of his most_holy death . Do you , all , join Us in prayer_for this intention , and as you study and ponder on the example of the '' Doctor Mellifluus , '' strive earnestly and eagerly to follow his footsteps . Now as a pledge of these benefits We bestow with heartfelt affection upon you , Venerable Brothers , upon the flocks entrusted to you , and particularly on those_who_have embraced the Institute of St . Bernard , the Apostolic Blessing . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , St . Peter s , on the th of May , on the feast of Pentecost , , in the th year_of_our_pontificate .
