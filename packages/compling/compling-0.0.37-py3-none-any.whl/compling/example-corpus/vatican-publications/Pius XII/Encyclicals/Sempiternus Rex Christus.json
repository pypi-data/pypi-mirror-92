Christ , the Eternal King , before he promised the headship of the Church to Peter , the son of John , called together his_disciples , and asking them what_they and other men believed about himself , praised the faith_which would conquer all the storms and attacks of the evil powers , and which Peter , enlightened by the Eternal Father , had declared in these_words : Thou art Christ , the Son of the Living God Matt . It -isaia- this faith which_-isaia- the strength of God for the salvation of every believer Rom . i , , and which brings forth the apostle s crown , the martyr s palm and the virgin s lily . This faith_has been defended and lucidly clarified especially by three oecumenical councils , those of Nicea , Ephesus and Chalcedon . It -isaia-_now fifteen hundred years since_the last of these was concluded . It -isaia- fitting , therefore_,_that both -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome and in the whole Catholic world , this_most happy event should be celebrated with due solemnity ; and so giving thanks to God the inspirer of all holy counsels , with deeply moved hearts , we institute those solemnities . As our predecessor Pope Pius XI of happy_memory solemnly commemorated the Nicene council in in the sacred city , and by his encyclical_letter Lux Veritatis recalled the sacred council of Ephesus in , so we by the present letter pay a tribute of equal honor to the council of Chalcedon . For inasmuch as both councils , Ephesus and Chalcedon , were concerned_with the hypostatic union of the Incarnate Word , they_are intimately connected_with one_another . From the earliest times both councils have enjoyed the highest honor , equally in the East , where_they are celebrated in the liturgy , and in the West . Gregory the Great bears_witness in the West to this_fact when he praises both councils together_with two of the preceding century , namely , those of Nicea and Constantinople , in the memorable sentence : On them , as a four cornered stone , the building of the holy faith stands erect , and whoever does_not hold their firm doctrine , whatever may be his_life or activity , even if he seems to be a rock , nevertheless lies outside the building Regist . From the consideration of this event and its attendant circumstances , two points arise and stand out , and these we wish , as far_as_possible , to make yet more clear . They are : the primacy of the Roman pontiff which shone forth clearly in this_very grave christological controversy and , secondly , the great_importance and weight of the dogmatic definition of Chalcedon . Let those_who , through the evils of the time , are separated_from the bosom and unity of the Church , especially_those who dwell in Eastern lands , not delay to follow_the example and the customs of their ancestors in paying due respect to the Roman primacy . And let those_who_are involved in the errors of Nestorius or Eutyches penetrate with clearer insight into the mystery of Christ and -atti_degli_apostoli- last accept this definition in its completeness . Those , also , who_are led by an excessive desire_for new things and , in their investigation of the mystery of our redemption boldly dare to go beyond_the sacred and inviolable limits of true doctrine , should ponder this definition more truly and more_deeply . Finally , let all those_who bear the Catholic name draw from it strong encouragement ; let_them hold fast this evangelical pearl of great price ; let_them profess and hold it with unadulterated faith ; let_them render it due honor inwardly and outwardly ; and what_-isaia- still more_important let_them pay it the tribute of lives in which , through God s mercy , they shun whatever_-isaia- unworthy , incongruous or blameable , and in which_they shine with the beauty of virtue , so that_they_may become sharers of this divinity , who deigned to be a partaker of our humanity . Now , to treat of things in due order , let us recall from the beginning the events which we commemorate . The originator of the whole controversy under discussion -atti_degli_apostoli- Chalcedon was Eutyches , a priest and archimandrite in a famous monastery of Constantinople . This man , in refuting the Nestorian heresy which maintained that_there were two persons in Christ , fell into the opposite error . A rash man and quite unskilled St . Leo the Great to Flavian , Ep . , with an extremely obstinate disposition , Eutyches asserted that two moments of time should be distinguished : thus before the Incarnation there_were two natures in Christ , the human and the divine ; after their union , however , only_one existed , since_the Word had absorbed the human_nature hominem ; the body of the Lord came from the Virgin Mary , but was_not of our substance and matter ; if , indeed , it was human , it was_not consubstantial with us , nor with_her who gave birth to Christ according to the flesh cf . Therefore , it was_not in true human_nature that Christ was_born , suffered , was fastened to the cross and rose from the tomb . Eutyches did_not grasp that before the union the human_nature of Christ did not_exist -atti_degli_apostoli- all , for it only began -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of his conception ; and it -isaia- absurd to suppose that after_the union one nature resulted from the coalescence of two ; for there_-isaia- no way_in_which two true and distinct natures can be reduced to one , and the more so in this case since_the divine nature_-isaia- infinite and unchangeable . Whoever judges wisely of these opinions will quickly conclude that by them the mystery of the divine dispensation -isaia- dissipated into shadowy absurdities and riddles . It was quite clear to those_who were of sound piety and theology that_this absurd novelty , so repugnant to the teachings of the prophets , to the words of the Gospel and to the dogma contained in the Apostles Creed and the Nicene profession_of_faith , had_been taken from the vaults of Apollinaris and Valentine . A special synod was called -atti_degli_apostoli- Constantinople ; St . Flavian , bishop of that city , presided ; Eutyches , who had_been vigorously spreading his errors throughout_the monasteries , was accused of heresy by Bishop Eusebius of Dorylaeum , and condemned . He considered that an injury had_been done to him_who had withstood the growth of the Nestorian heresy , and appealed to the judgment of some of the bishops placed in higher authority . Leo the Great , bishop of the Apostolic See , also received letters of appeal of this_kind . No one could have_been more suitable and capable for the refutation of Eutyches s error . His solid and shining virtues , his zealous watch equally over peace and religion , his strenuous defense of the dignity of the Roman see , his skill in the spoken word and equally in the management of affairs , have won for him the admiration of all succeeding ages . Moreover , he was accustomed in his allocutions and letters to maintain with_great piety and pious greatness that the mystery of the one person and the two natures in Christ could never be preached sufficiently . The Catholic Church lives by this faith , and -isaia- nourished by it , that in Jesus Christ neither -isaia- the humanity believed with the true Divinity , nor the divinity without true humanity St . Leo the Great , Ep . The Archimandrite Eutyches , however , was_not confident of the patronage of the Roman pontiff So he craftily made use of his friend Chrysaphius , who_was a favorite of the emperor , to persuade Theodosius II to take his part and to summon another council -atti_degli_apostoli- Ephesus under the presidency of Dioscorus , bishop of Alexandria . This man_,_who as both a friend to himself and an enemy to Flavian , bishop of Constantinople , deceived by a similarity of terms , gave it out that , like his predecessor Cyril , he was determined to defend with all his_power that , as there_was one person in Christ , so after_the unification , there_was also one nature in Christ . For the sake of peace St . Leo the Great sent delegates to the council . Among other letters , they brought to the council two epistles , one addressed to the synod , and the other containing a perfect and full developed doctrine in which_the errors of Eutyches were refuted , addressed to Flavian . But -atti_degli_apostoli- this synod of Ephesus , which St . Leo rightly called a Robbers council , Dioscorus and Eutyches carried off everything with a high hand . The first places in the council were denied to the apostolic delegates ; the letters of the pope were_not allowed to be read , the votes of the bishops were extorted by threats and stratagems ; among others Flavian was accused of heresy , deprived of his pastoral_ministry and thrown into prison , where he died . The rash fury of Dioscorus even went to the length of criminally hurling an excommunication -atti_degli_apostoli- the Apostolic See itself . Leo learnt from the deacon Hilary of the evil deeds of this council , he condemned and annulled all the decrees and decisions made by it . His grief -atti_degli_apostoli- these crimes was greatly increased by the frequent appeals to his authority made by the numerous bishops_who had_been deposed . Worthy of mention are the lines written by Flavian and by Theodoret of Cyrus to the chief pastor of the Church . These are Flavian s words : After the unjust sentence which it pleased Dioscorus to pronounce against me , everything , as if by some prearranged pact , turned against me ; when I appealed to the throne of the prince of the apostles , the Apostolic See , and to the holy synod which_-isaia- under the authority of your Holiness , a large number of soldiers surrounded me , prevented my taking refuge -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar , and tried to drag me from the church Schwartz . Theodoret wrote as follows : If Paul , the preacher of truth . betook himself to the great Peter , much_more do we who_are weak and lowly turn to the Apostolic See , that_we_may obtain from you a remedy for the ulcers of the Church . For it -isaia- your part to direct us in all things . I await the decision of the Apostolic See . above all that I may learn whether I ought to accept this unjust decision or not : for it -isaia- your decision that I await Theodoret to Leo the Great , Ep . Leo then urged Theodosius and Pulcheria in many letters to wipe out this stain . He proposed that_they_should remedy this sad state of affairs by summoning a council in Italy to reverse the decrees made -atti_degli_apostoli- Ephesus . When the Emperor Valentine III , his_mother Galla and his wife Eudoxia were entering St . Peter s Basilica , he received them accompanied by an assembly of bishops , and besought them_with sighs and tears to do all they could to remedy the evil condition of the Church . The emperor wrote to his_brother emperor in the East , and the royal ladies joined their entreaties to his . But it was all to no purpose . Theodosius was in the hands of evil counselors and did nothing to amend the evil . However , he died suddenly ; his sister Pulcheria succeeded him and took as her consort on the throne and in marriage one Marcian . Both of these persons were distinguished by their renown for wisdom and true religion . Then Anatolius , who had_been illegally raised by Dioscorus to the see of Constantinople , accepted the letter which St . Leo wrote to Flavian on the Incarnation of our Lord . The remains of Flavian were brought back to Constantinople with_great solemnity . The exiled bishops were restored to their sees , and the general hostility to the heresy of Eutyches grew so strong that_there scarcely seemed to be any further need_for a council . To this result the invasions of the barbarians , which_were jeopardizing the safety of the Roman empire , also contributed . Nevertheless , -atti_degli_apostoli- the emperor s wish and with the pope s approval , a council was held . Chalcedon was a city of Bithynia near the Thracian Bosphorus , within sight of Constantinople , which_was situated on the opposite bank . Here , in the vast suburban basilica of St . Euphemia , virgin and martyr , on the th of October , assembled the fathers , who_had previously met for this_purpose in the city of Nicea . They were about in number , all of the East , except for two exiles from Africa . The book of the gospels was placed in the middle ; nineteen representatives of the emperor and the senate took their places before the altar rails . The role of apostolic delegates had_been entrusted to the devout Bishops Paschasinus of Lilybaeum in Sicily and Lucentius of Ascoli , and to the priests Boniface and Basil . To these was added Julian bishop of Cos , to aid them by his diligent labors . The delegates of the Roman pontiff took the first places among the bishops ; they_were named first , they spoke first , they signed the Acts first , and by virtue of their delegated authority , they confirmed or rejected the decisions of the others . For example , in the case of the condemnation of Dioscorus , the delegates ratified it in these_words : The holy and blessed archbishop of great and ancient Rome , Leo , through us and through_this holy synod , together_with_the blessed and praiseworthy Apostle Peter who_-isaia- the rock and foundation of the Orthodox Faith , has deprived him Dioscorus of all episcopal dignity and removed him from every priestly office Mansi , Conc . Act III ; Schwartz II , Vol . Furthermore , the papal delegates not_only exercised the authority of presidents , but their right to this honor of presiding was recognized by all the fathers of the council , as was shown clearly by the letter sent by the synod to St . Leo For you , they wrote , showed us benevolence in presiding over us in the persons of those_who held your place , as the head over the members synod of Chalcedon to St . It -isaia- not necessary_for us to relate the whole history of the synod , but we will touch only on the principal points which served to place the truth in full light and to foster the cause of religion . Therefore , since it concerns the dignity of the Apostolic See , we must mention canon XXVIII of this council , by which_the next place of honor after_the Roman see was granted to Constantinople , as the imperial city . Although there_was nothing in this against the divine primacy of jurisdiction of the see of Peter , which indeed was taken for granted , nevertheless , this canon was passed in the absence of the papal legates , and they subsequently objected to it . It was therefore clandestine , surreptitious and lacking in all force of law and , as such , condemned by St . Leo in many letters . Marcian and Pulcheria accepted this rescissory sentence , and even Anatolius wrote to St . Leo excusing his blameworthy boldness : With regard to the decree laid_down by the recent synod of Chalcedon on behalf of the see of Constantinople , let your Beatitude rest assured that_this was_not my fault . But it was_the desire of the reverend clergy of Constantinople . the validity and confirmation of this action being reserved to the authority of your Beatitude Anatolius to St . Leo the Great . Let us come now to the central point of the whole question , i . to the solemn definition of the Catholic faith , by which_the pernicious error of Eutyches was rejected and condemned . In the fourth session of the sacred synod the representatives of the emperor asked that a new formula of the faith should be composed . But the papal legate , Paschasinus , expressed the feeling of all when he replied that_it_was not necessary ; the ground , he said was sufficiently covered by the creeds already in use , and the canonical documents approved by the Church ; among_these the letter of St . Leo to Flavin was_the most important . , after_the creeds of Nicea and Constantinople and their explanations by St . Cyril -atti_degli_apostoli- the council of Ephesus the writings composed by the holy and apostolic Leo , pope of the universal Church , against the heresies of Nestorius and Eutyches , have_already shown what_the true faith_-isaia- . This holy synod likewise holds and follows this_same faith Mansi , vii , Act . It -isaia- useful to note here that_this very_important letter of St . Leo to Flavian concerning the Incarnation of the Word was read in the third session of the council , and hardly had the voice of the reader ceased , when there went up a unanimous cry : This -isaia- the faith of the Fathers , this_-isaia- the faith of the Apostles . So we all believe , and so believe all orthodox Christians . Let him be anathema who_does_not believe this . Peter has spoken through Leo Schwartz , II , Vol . After this all unanimously agreed that the document of the bishop of Rome fully and perfectly concorded with the creeds of Nicea and Constantinople . Nevertheless , in the fifth session -atti_degli_apostoli- the requests of the representatives of the Emperor Marcian and the senate , a new definition of the faith was worked out by a select committee of the bishops congregated from diverse lands in the basilica of St . k was_made up of a prologue , of the creeds of Nicea and Constantinople which_was promulgated for the first time and of a condemnation of the doctrine of Eutyches . This rule of faith was approved by the unanimous consent of the council . We think it of importance , Venerable Brethren , to delay a little in elucidating this document of the Roman pontiff , which_was such an outstanding vindication of the Catholic faith . Firstly , against the assertion of Eutyches : I confess that_our Lord was of two natures before their union ; after their union I confess that he had only_one nature St . liv , , the holy bishop , not_without a certain indignation , opposed the following clear statement of the luminous truth : I -amos- surprised that_this absurd and perverse statement should_have escaped the severe reprimand of those_who gave judgment . the Only Begotten Son of God -isaia- impiously described as being of two natures before the Incarnation and , equally wickedly to the Word made Flesh -isaia- attributed only_one nature Ibid . He attacked with equal force and directness the opposite errors of Nestorius . It -isaia- because there_was only_one person in both natures , that the Son of God took flesh from the Virgin from whom he was_born . And again the Son of God -isaia- said to have_been crucified and been buried , because he suffered these_things in the weakness of his human_nature , not in the divinity itself , for through the divinity the only Begotten -isaia- co eternal and consubstantial with the Father . Wherefore in the Creed we all confess '' the only Begotten Son of God to have_been crucified and buried '' Ep . Augustinus , Contra Serm . In addition to the distinction of natures in Christ , there_-isaia- clearly shown here_the distinction of the properties and activities , which arise from his double nature , Since the properties of each nature remain intact , and they_are joined together in one person , majesty accepts lowliness , strength accepts weakness and the Eternal becomes mortal Ep . And again : Each nature possesses its properties without defect Ep . But both sets of properties and activities are attributed to the One Person of the Word , because One and the same Person -isaia- . truly the Son of God and truly the Son of Man Ep . Whence In his actions either nature with the co operation of the other performs what_-isaia- proper to it ; thus_the Word performs the part of the Word , and the humanity the part of the humanity Ibid . In these expressions appears the use of what_-isaia- called the Common Application of Terms Communicatio Idiomatum , which Cyril vindicated against Nestorius . It depends on the firm foundation that both natures subsist by the One Person of the Word begotten before all ages of the Father and born of Mary according to the flesh in the course of time . This sublime doctrine , which_-isaia- drawn_from the gospels and differs in no way from that of the council of Ephesus refutes Eutyches as well as Nestorius . The dogmatic definition of the council of Chalcedon concords with it absolutely and perfectly , for_this definition likewise defines two distinct natures and one person in Christ in the following clear and precise words : This great and holy oecumenical council condemns those_who pretend that_there were two natures in the Lord before the union , and imagine that_there was only_one after_the union . Following , therefore , in the traditions of the holy Fathers we teach that all with one voice confess that the Son of God and our Lord Jesus Christ are one_and_the_same , and that_he_-isaia- perfect in his divinity , perfect in his humanity , true God and true man , made of a rational soul and a body , consubstantial with the Father in his divinity , and the same also in his humanity received_from_the Virgin Mary in recent_times for our sake and for our_salvation , one_and_the_same Christ , the Son , the Lord , the Only Begotten , having two natures without confusion , change , division or separation ; the distinction between_the natures was_not removed by the union , but the properties of each remain inviolate and are joined together in one person . He -isaia- not sundered or divided into two persons , but_-isaia- one_and_the_same Son and only Begotten God the Word , the Lord , Jesus Christ Mansi . If anyone asks how it -isaia- that the statements of the council of Chalcedon are of such outstanding excellence in their clarity and their efficiency in the refutation of error , we reply that_this arises from the fact_that ambiguities had_been removed and a most exact terminology was used . For in the Chalcedonian definition of the faith and the same concept underlies the terms Person Pr\u00f3sopon and Hypostasis Up\u00f3stasis ; the term Nature has a totally different sense , and its meaning -isaia- never given to the other_words . So that the Nestorians and Eutychians of old and certain modern writers err when_they maintain that the council of Chalcedon corrected the decision of the council of Ephesus . Rather the one perfected the other , so that a synthesis or composition of the main Christological doctrine was available in fuller form for the second and third oecumenical councils of Constantinople . It -isaia- indeed sad that the ancient adversaries of the council of Chalcedon also called Monophysites should_have rejected this_doctrine , so lucid , so coherent and so complete , on the strength of certain badly understood expressions of ancient writers . While they rejected the absurd teaching of Eutyches about the mixture of natures in Christ , they obstinately clung to the well_known expression : One Incarnate nature of the Word God . This expression had_been used by Cyril of Alexandria who took it from St . Athanasius with a perfectly correct meaning , since he used the term nature to signify person . The Fathers of Chalcedon , therefore , totally removed what_was ambiguous or liable to cause error in these expressions . For they applied the same terms as are used in the theology of the Trinity , to the exposition of our Lord s Incarnation . Thus they made nature and essence essentia the same , and likewise Person and Hypostasis , and they treated the latter two names as totally different in meaning , from the former two . Their approach , on the other_hand , had made nature the equivalent of Person not of essence essentia . For the reason just given there_are today some separated bodies in Egypt , Ethiopia , Syria , Armenia and elsewhere , who go wrong mainly in their use of words in defining the doctrine of the Incarnation . This may be demonstrated from their liturgical and theological books . Moreover , in the twelfth century , a writer of the highest repute , among the Armenians , clearly expounded his views of this_matter in these_words : We speak of Christ as one nature , not to imply confusion as does Eutyches , nor diminution , as does Apollinaris , but in the sense of Cyril of Alexandria , who in his book Scholiorum Adversus Nestorium says , '' There -isaia- one nature of the Incarnate Word as the Fathers taught '' . And we also teach this according to the tradition of the saints , but_not according to the opinion of heretics . For they introduce confusion and change and alterations into the union in Christ . We say there_-isaia-_one nature referring to the hypostasis , which_you also speak of in Christ ; and this_-isaia- correct and granted by us , and equally valid -isaia-_our own expression : '' One Nature . '' Nor do we refuse to say '' two Natures '' , provided there_-isaia- no implication of the division maintained by Nestorius , but the expression -isaia- used against the confusion introduced by Eutyches and Apollinaris Nerses iv , in his Libellum Confessionis Fidei to the Emperor Manuel Comnenus cf . Narsetis Claiensis Armenorum Catholici , Opera . If then it -isaia- the climax of gladness and the consummation of holy joy , when that comes to pass which_the Psalmist said : Behold how good and how pleasant it -isaia- for brethren to live together in unity Ps . , I ; if then the glory of God combined with the greatest profit for all -isaia- apparent when_the sheep of Christ are joined together in the fullness of truth and the fullness of charity , let those_whom with sorrow and love we have mentioned above , consider whether it -isaia- right and expedient that , principally on account of the original ambiguity of certain words , they_should still hold apart_from the one Holy Church , founded on sapphires cf . liv , , that_-isaia- to say , on the Prophets and Apostles , on the supreme corner stone itself , Christ Jesus cf . There -isaia- another enemy of the faith of Chalcedon , widely diffused outside the fold of the Catholic religion . This -isaia- an opinion for_which a rashly and falsely understood sentence of St . Paul s Epistle to the Philippians ii , , supplies a basis and a shape . This -isaia- called the kenotic doctrine , and according to it , they imagine that the divinity was taken away from the Word in Christ . It -isaia- a wicked invention , equally to be condemned with the Docetism opposed to it . It reduces the whole mystery of the Incarnation and Redemption to empty the bloodless imaginations . With the entire and perfect nature of man thus grandly St . Leo the Great He Who was true God was_born , complete in his_own nature , complete in ours Ep . While there_-isaia- no reason_why the humanity of Christ should_not be studied more_deeply also from a psychological point_of_view , there_are , nevertheless , some who , in their arduous pursuit , desert the ancient teachings more_than -isaia- right , and make an erroneous use of the authority of the definition of Chalcedon to support their new ideas . These emphasize the state and condition of Christ s human_nature to such an extent as to make it seem something existing in its_own right subjectum quoddam sui juris , and not as subsisting in the Word itself . But the council of Chalcedon in full accord with_that of Ephesus , clearly asserts that both natures are_united in One Person and subsistence , and rules out the placing of two individuals in Christ , as if some one man , completely autonomous in himself , had_been taken up and placed by the side of the Word . Leo not_only adheres to this opinion i . that of Chalcedon , but he also indicates the source whence he derives his sound doctrine . Whatever , he says , we have written has manifestly clearly been taken from the doctrine of the Apostles and of the Gospels Ep . It -isaia- indeed the truth_that from the earliest times and in the most ancient writings , sermons and liturgical prayers , the Church openly and without qualification professes that_our Lord Jesus Christ , the only Begotten Son of the Eternal Father , was_born on earth , suffered , was nailed to the cross , rose from the sepulcher and ascended into_heaven . And , further , the words of sacred Scripture give to the one Christ , the Son of God , human attributes , and to the same Christ the Son of Man , divine attributes . John the Evangelist declares : The Word was made_flesh John i , . Paul writes of him : When he was in the form of God . he humbled himself and became obedient even unto death Phil . ii , ; or again : But when_the fullness_of_time was come , God sent his Son , made from a woman Gal . iv , , and our Divine Redeemer himself put the matter beyond doubt when he says : I and the Father are One John x , ; and again , I went out from the Father and I came into_the_world John xvi , . The divine origin of our Redeemer -isaia-_also manifest from this passage of the Gospel : I came down from heaven , not_that I should do my own will , but the will of him_that sent me John vi , . And again : He who descended , this_-isaia- he who ascended above all the heavens Eph . Thomas Aquinas explains this last sentence thus : He who descended , this -isaia-_the_same as he who ascended . By these_words -isaia- signified the unity of the person of God and man . For the Son of God came down by taking human_nature , but the Son of Man ascended according_to_his human_nature to the sublimity of eternal_life . And so he -isaia-_the_same Son of God who came down and Son of Man who went up St . iii circa finem . This same doctrine was set_forth by our predecessor Leo the Great in these_words : What principally contributed to the justification of mankind was that the only Begotten Son of God deigned to become the Son of Man , so that being God smo\u00fasios to the Father , that_-isaia- of the same substance , the same person should exist as true man consubstantial with his_mother in the flesh ; we rejoice over both these_things , since only by both are we saved ; we admit no division of the visible from the invisible , the corporeal from the incorporeal , the passible from the impassible , the palpable from the impalpable , the form of the servant from the form of God . For although he remains the one from eternity , he began to be the other in time ; these_two have met in unity and can have neither separation nor end St . Only , therefore , if we adhere to the holy inviolate faith , that_there_-isaia- one Person in Christ , that of the Word , in which two natures entirely distinct from each_other , the divine and the human , distinct also in their properties and activities , converge only if we adhere to this_doctrine does the magnificence and the fatherly mercy of our ineffable redemption shine_forth . O height of the mercy and justice of God , who came to the rescue of guilty creatures and made them sons unto Himself ! How the heavens bent down towards us , the wintry frosts vanished , the flowers appeared in our land , and we became new men , a new creation , a new structure , a holy people , a heavenly offspring . Truly the Word suffered in his flesh and shed his_blood on the cross and paid for us sinners to the Eternal Father the superabounding price of our satisfaction . Hence it -isaia- that the certain hope of salvation sheds its light on those_who in genuine faith and ardent charity adhere to him , and with the help of the graces that flow from him , produce the fruits of justice . The very recalling of the memory of these distinguished and glorious events in the history of the Church naturally leads us to turn our_thoughts to the Orientals with a yet more loving warmth of paternal affection . For the oecumenical council of Chalcedon -isaia- a monument of their outstanding glory , and one_which , without_doubt , will live throughout_the ages . For in this council under the leadership of the Apostolic See , an assembly of Oriental bishops vigilantly defended and wonderfully expounded against the rashness of the innovator , the doctrine of the unity of Christ , in whose person meet without confusion two distinct natures , the divine and the human . But alas ! for long centuries many of those_who dwell in the East have unhappily fallen away from the unity of the Mystical Body of Christ , of which_the hypostatic union -isaia-_the_most luminous prototype . Would it not be holy , salutary and in accordance_with_the will of God that -atti_degli_apostoli- last all these should return to the one sheepfold of Christ ? . For our part we desire that_they_should always bear in mind_that Our thoughts are thoughts of peace and not of affliction cf . It -isaia- well_known , moreover , that_we_have demonstrated this by our actions . If , under the pressure we boast of this , then we boast in the Lord , who_-isaia- the giver of every goodwill . For we have followed in the path of our_predecessors and worked diligently to facilitate the return of the Oriental peoples to the Catholic Church . We have guarded their legitimate rites . We have promoted the study of their affairs . We have promulgated beneficent laws for them . We have shown deep solicitude in our dealings with the sacred council of the Roman curia for oriental affairs . We have bestowed the Roman purple on the patriarch of the Armenians . When the recent war was waging and producing its fruits of famine , want and disease , we made no distinction between_them and those_who_are accustomed to call us Father , but sought everywhere to relieve the increasing misery ; we strove to help widows , children , old people and the sick . We would_have been happier truly had our means been equal to our desires ! Let those then who , through the calamities of time , have_been cut off , not be slow to pay due respect to this divinely erected and unbroken rock , this Apostolic See for_whom to rule -isaia- to serve . Let them bear in mind and imitate Flavian , that second John Chrysostom , in his sufferings for_justice ; and the fathers of Chalcedon , those most worthy members of the Mystical Body of Christ ; and Marcian , that strong , gentle and wise ruler ; and Pulcheria , that resplendent lily of inviolate royal beauty . From such a return to the unity of the Church we foresee that there_would flow a rich fountain of blessings unto the common_good of the whole Christian world . Truly we are aware of the accumulation of prejudice that tenaciously prevents the happy fulfillment of the prayer offered by Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the last Supper to his Eternal Father for the followers of the Gospel : That they_may be one John xvii , . But we know also_that such_-isaia- the strength of prayer , when those_who pray are joined together in a common fervor , a strong faith , and a clear conscience , that it can lift up a mountain and cast it headlong into the sea cf . We desire then and we wish_that all those_who_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart an earnest invitation to Christian unity and surely no one_who belongs to Christ would belittle the importance of this_matter should pour forth their united prayers and supplications to God , from whom comes all unity , order and beauty , that the praiseworthy desires of every right thinking person may soon be brought to fulfillment . Let research be made without jealousy or anger to straighten out the path by which_this good may be reached ; let us bear in mind_that today we are accustomed to retrace and weigh the events of bygone ages more calmly than in the past . Furthermore , there_-isaia- another reason which demands the immediate coalition of all ranks under the single sign of the cross in order to oppose the turbulent attacks of the infernal enemy . Who -isaia- not horror struck -atti_degli_apostoli- the ferocity and hatred with_which_the enemies of God , in many parts_of_the_world , threaten to eradicate and wipe out everything divine and Christian ? All those_who_are signed with the sacred character of baptism and are deputed by their state to fight the good fight of Christ , cannot remain disunited and dispersed against the confederated ranks of their enemies . The chains , the agonies , the tortures , the groans , the blood of the innumerable multitude of persons , known and unknown , who recently and even today , have suffered and still suffer on account of their courage and constancy in the profession of their_faith , cry out to all with louder and louder voice as the days go by , to embrace the unity of the Church . Our hope_for the return of these brothers and sons separated_from the Apostolic See -isaia- made stronger by this harsh crucifixion and these bloody martyrdoms of so many_other brothers and sons . Let no one neglect or impede the saving work of God . To the blessings and joys of this return we exhort and urge all those_who follow_the erroneous doctrines of the Nestorians and the Monophysites . Let them be sure that_we_should think it the brightest gem in the crown of our apostolate if the opportunity were given us of treating with honor and charity those_who_are the more dear to us because the long period of their withdrawal has excited in us the greater desire_for their return . This -isaia-_our final wish , venerable_brethren_,_that when through your diligence the memory of the sacred council of Chalcedon -isaia- celebrated , all should be urged to adhere with a most firm faith to Christ our Redeemer and our King . Let no one be deceived by the fallacies of human philosophy or led astray by the quibbles of human speech ; let no one corrupt by perverse innovation or weaken by doubt the dogma confirmed -atti_degli_apostoli- Chalcedon , namely_,_that there_are in Christ two true and perfect natures , the divine and the human , not confused one_with another , but joined together and subsisting in the one person of the Word . Let all then be joined in a close bond with the author of our_salvation , who -isaia-_the_way of holy life , the truth of divine doctrine , and the life of eternal happiness St . Let all love our restored nature in him , let_them cultivate the liberty bought by him ; let_them cast out the folly of the aged world ; let_them turn with_joy to the wisdom that_-isaia- ignorant of old age , the wisdom of spiritual infancy . May God Who -isaia- One in Three , whose nature_-isaia- goodness , whose will -isaia- power , receive these burning desires , through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of God , the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul , and Euphemia the Virgin Martyr , who triumphed -atti_degli_apostoli- Chalcedon . Do you_,_venerable_brethren , add your prayers to ours for_this cause , and see_that what_we_have written to you -isaia- made_known as widely as possible . Giving you now our thanks for_this , to you and to all priests and to all Christ s faithful , whose spiritual advancement lies in your_care , lovingly we bestow the apostolic_blessing . May it enable you to take with_greater readiness Christ s yoke upon you , a yoke that_-isaia- neither heavy nor harsh , and may you become more_and_more like to him in humility , of whose glory you hope to be sharers .
