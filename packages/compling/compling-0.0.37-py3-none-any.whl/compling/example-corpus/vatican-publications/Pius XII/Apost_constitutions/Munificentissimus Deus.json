{"title": "Munificentissimus Deus", "author": "Pius XII", "type_of_text": "Apost_constitutions", "pub_date": "01/11/1950", "text": "APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTION OF POPE PIUS XII MUNIFICENTISSIMUS DEUS DEFINING THE DOGMA OF THE ASSUMPTION November , . The most bountiful God , who_-isaia- almighty , the plan of whose providence rests upon wisdom and love , tempers , in the secret purpose of his_own mind , the sorrows of peoples and of individual men by means of joys that he interposes in their_lives from time to time , in such_a_way_that , under different conditions and in different_ways , all things may work together unto good for those_who love him . Now , just like the present age , our_pontificate -isaia- weighed down by ever so many cares , anxieties , and troubles , by reason of very severe calamities that_have taken_place and by reason of the fact_that many have strayed away from truth and virtue . Nevertheless , we are greatly consoled to see_that , while the Catholic faith_-isaia- being professed publicly and vigorously , piety toward_the Virgin Mother of God -isaia- flourishing and daily growing more fervent , and that almost everywhere on earth it -isaia- showing indications of a better and holier life . Thus , while the Blessed Virgin -isaia- fulfilling in the most affectionate manner her_maternal duties on behalf of those redeemed by the blood of Christ , the minds and the hearts of her_children are_being vigorously aroused to a more assiduous consideration of her prerogatives . Actually God , who from all eternity regards Mary with a most favorable and unique affection , has '' when_the fullness_of_time came '' put the plan of his providence into_effect in such_a_way_that all the privileges and prerogatives he had granted to her in his sovereign generosity were to shine_forth in her in a kind of perfect harmony . And , although the Church has_always recognized this supreme generosity and the perfect harmony of graces and has daily studied them more_and_more throughout_the course of the centuries , still it -isaia- in our_own age that the privilege of the bodily Assumption into_heaven of Mary , the Virgin Mother of God , has certainly shone forth more_clearly . That privilege has shone forth in new radiance since our predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , solemnly proclaimed the dogma of the loving Mother of God s Immaculate Conception . These two privileges are_most closely bound to one_another . Christ overcame sin and death by his_own death , and one_who through Baptism has_been born again in a supernatural way has conquered sin and death through the same Christ . Yet , according to the general rule , God does_not will to grant to the just the full effect of the victory over death until the end of time has come . And so it -isaia- that the bodies of even the just are corrupted after death , and only on the last day will they be joined , each to its_own glorious soul . Now God has willed that the Blessed Virgin Mary should be exempted from this general rule . She , by an entirely unique privilege , completely overcame sin by her Immaculate Conception , and as a result she_was not subject to the law of remaining in the corruption of the grave , and she did not_have to wait until the end of time for the redemption of her body . Thus , when it was solemnly proclaimed that Mary , the Virgin Mother of God , was from the very_beginning free_from the taint of original_sin , the minds of the faithful were filled_with a stronger hope_that the day might soon come when_the dogma of the Virgin Mary s bodily Assumption into_heaven would also be defined by the Church s supreme teaching_authority . Actually it was seen that not_only individual Catholics , but_also those_who could speak for nations or ecclesiastical provinces , and even a considerable number of the Fathers of the Vatican Council , urgently petitioned the Apostolic See to this effect . During the course of time such postulations and petitions did_not decrease but_rather grew continually in number and in urgency . In this cause there_were pious crusades of prayer . Many outstanding theologians eagerly and zealously carried_out investigations on this_subject either privately or in public ecclesiastical institutions and in other schools where_the sacred disciplines are taught . Marian Congresses , both national and international in scope , have_been held in many_parts of the Catholic world . These studies and investigations have brought out into even clearer light the fact_that the dogma of the Virgin Mary s Assumption into_heaven -isaia- contained in the deposit of Christian faith entrusted to the Church . They have resulted in many more petitions , begging and urging the Apostolic See that this_truth be solemnly defined . In this pious striving , the faithful have_been associated in a wonderful way with_their own holy bishops , who_have sent petitions of this_kind , truly remarkable in number , to this See of the Blessed Peter . Consequently , when we were elevated to the throne of the supreme pontificate , petitions of this_sort had already_been addressed by the thousands from every part_of_the_world and from every class of people , from our beloved_sons the Cardinals of the Sacred College , from our_venerable_brethren , archbishops and bishops , from dioceses and from parishes . Consequently , while we sent up earnest prayers to God that_he_might grant to our_mind the light of the Holy Spirit , to enable us to make a decision on this_most serious subject , we issued special orders in which we commanded that , by corporate effort , more advanced inquiries into this_matter should be begun and that , in the meantime , all the petitions about the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into_heaven which_had_been sent to this Apostolic See from the time of Pius IX , our predecessor_of_happy_memory , down to our_own days should be gathered together and carefully evaluated . And , since we were dealing_with a matter of such_great moment and of such importance , we considered it opportune to ask all our_venerable_brethren in the episcopate directly and authoritatively that_each of them should make known to us his mind in a formal statement . Hence , on May , , we gave them our letter '' Deiparae Virginis Mariae , '' a letter in which these_words are contained : '' Do you_,_venerable_brethren , in your outstanding wisdom and prudence , judge that the bodily Assumption of the Blessed Virgin can be proposed and defined as a dogma of faith ? Do you , with your clergy_and_people , desire it ? '' . But those_whom '' the Holy Spirit has placed as bishops to rule_the Church of God '' gave an almost unanimous affirmative response to both these questions . This '' outstanding agreement of the Catholic prelates and the faithful , '' affirming that the bodily Assumption of God s Mother into_heaven can be defined as a dogma of faith , since it shows us the concordant teaching of the Church s ordinary doctrinal authority and the concordant faith of the Christian people which_the same doctrinal authority sustains and directs , thus by itself and in an entirely certain and infallible way , manifests this privilege as a truth revealed by God and contained in that divine deposit which Christ has delivered to his Spouse to be guarded faithfully and to be taught infallibly . Certainly this teaching_authority of the Church , not by any merely human effort but under the protection of the Spirit of Truth , and therefore absolutely without error , carries out the commission entrusted to it , that of preserving the revealed truths pure and entire throughout every_age , in such_a_way_that it presents them undefiled , adding nothing to them and taking nothing away from them . For , as the Vatican Council teaches , '' the Holy Spirit was_not promised to the successors of Peter in such_a_way_that , by his revelation , they_might manifest new doctrine , but so that , by his assistance , they_might guard as sacred and might faithfully propose the revelation delivered through the apostles , or the deposit of faith . '' Thus , from the universal agreement of the Church s ordinary teaching_authority we have a certain and firm proof , demonstrating that the Blessed Virgin Mary s bodily Assumption into_heaven which surely no faculty of the human mind could know by its_own natural powers , as far as the heavenly glorification of the virginal body of the loving Mother of God -isaia- concerned -isaia- a truth that_has_been revealed by God and consequently something_that must be firmly and faithfully believed by all children of the Church . For , as the Vatican Council asserts , '' all those_things are to be believed by divine and Catholic faith_which are contained in the written Word of God or in Tradition , and which_are proposed by the Church , either in solemn judgment or in its ordinary and universal teaching office , as divinely revealed truths_which must be believed . Various testimonies , indications and signs of this common belief of the Church are evident from remote times down through the course of the centuries ; and this_same belief becomes more_clearly manifest from day to day . Christ s faithful , through the teaching and the leadership of their pastors , have learned from the sacred_books that the Virgin Mary , throughout_the course of her earthly pilgrimage , led a life troubled by cares , hardships , and sorrows , and that , moreover , what_the holy old man Simeon had foretold actually came to pass , that_-isaia- , that a terribly sharp sword pierced her_heart as she stood under the cross of her_divine Son , our Redeemer . In the same_way , it was_not difficult for them to admit that the great Mother of God , like her only_begotten Son , had actually passed from this_life . But this in no way prevented them_from believing and from professing openly that her sacred body had never been subject to the corruption of the tomb , and that the august tabernacle of the Divine Word had never been reduced to dust and ashes . Actually , enlightened by divine_grace and moved by affection for_her , God s Mother and our_own dearest Mother , they_have contemplated in an ever clearer light the wonderful harmony and order of those privileges which_the most provident God has lavished upon this loving associate of our Redeemer , privileges which reach such an exalted plane that , except for_her , nothing created by God other_than the human_nature of Jesus Christ has_ever reached this level . The innumerable temples which_have_been dedicated to the Virgin Mary assumed into_heaven clearly attest this faith . So do those sacred images , exposed therein for the veneration of the faithful , which bring this unique triumph of the Blessed Virgin before the eyes of all men . Moreover , cities , dioceses , and individual regions have_been placed under the special patronage and guardianship of the Virgin Mother of God assumed into_heaven . In the same_way , religious institutes , with the approval of the Church , have_been founded and have_taken their name from this privilege . Nor can we pass over in silence the fact_that in the Rosary of Mary , the recitation of which_this Apostolic See so urgently recommends , there_-isaia-_one mystery proposed for pious meditation which , as all know , deals with the Blessed Virgin s Assumption into_heaven . This belief of the sacred pastors and of Christ s faithful -isaia- universally manifested still_more splendidly by the fact_that , since ancient times , there have_been both in the East and in the West solemn liturgical offices commemorating this privilege . The holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church have_never failed to draw enlightenment from this_fact since , as everyone knows , the sacred_liturgy , '' because_it_-isaia- the profession , subject to the supreme teaching_authority within_the Church , of heavenly truths , can supply proofs and testimonies of no small value for deciding a particular point of Christian doctrine . In the liturgical books which deal_with the feast either of the dormition or of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin there_are expressions that agree in testifying that , when_the Virgin Mother of God passed from this earthly exile to heaven , what happened to her sacred body was , by the decree of divine Providence , in keeping_with_the dignity of the Mother of the Word Incarnate , and with the other privileges she had_been accorded . Thus , to cite an illustrious example , this_-isaia- set_forth in that sacramentary which Adrian I , our predecessor of immortal memory , sent to the Emperor Charlemagne . These words are_found in this volume : '' Venerable to us , O Lord , -isaia- the festivity of this_day on which_the holy Mother of God suffered temporal death , but still could_not be kept down by the bonds of death , who_has begotten your Son our Lord incarnate from herself . What -isaia- here indicated in that sobriety characteristic of the Roman liturgy -isaia- presented more_clearly and completely in other ancient liturgical books . To take one as an example , the Gallican sacramentary designates this privilege of Mary s as '' an ineffable mystery all the more worthy of praise as the Virgin s Assumption -isaia- something unique among_men . '' And , in the Byzantine liturgy , not_only -isaia- the Virgin Mary s bodily Assumption connected time and time again with the dignity of the Mother of God , but also_with the other privileges , and in particular with the virginal motherhood granted her by a singular decree of God s Providence . '' God , the King of the universe , has granted you favors that surpass nature . As he kept you a virgin in childbirth , thus he has kept your body incorrupt in the tomb and has glorified it by his_divine act of transferring it from the tomb . The fact_that the Apostolic See , which_has inherited the function entrusted to the Prince of the Apostles , the function of confirming the brethren in the faith , has by its_own authority , made the celebration of this feast ever_more solemn , has certainly and effectively moved the attentive minds of the faithful to appreciate always more completely the magnitude of the mystery it commemorates . So it was that the Feast of the Assumption was elevated from the rank which it had occupied from the beginning among the other Marian feasts to be classed among the more solemn celebrations of the entire liturgical cycle . And , when our predecessor St . Sergius I prescribed what_-isaia- known as the litany , or the stational procession , to be held on four Marian feasts , he specified together the Feasts of the Nativity , the Annunciation , the Purification , and the Dormition of the Virgin Mary . Leo IV saw to it that the feast , which_was already being celebrated under the title of the Assumption of the Blessed Mother of God , should be observed in even a more solemn way when he ordered a vigil to be held on the day before it and prescribed prayers to be recited after it until the octave day . When this had_been done , he decided to take_part himself in the celebration , in the midst of a great multitude of the faithful . Moreover , the fact_that a holy fast had_been ordered from ancient times for the day prior to the feast -isaia- made very evident by what our predecessor St . Nicholas I testifies in treating of the principal fasts which '' the Holy Roman Church has observed for a long time , and still observes . However , since_the liturgy of the Church does_not engender the Catholic faith , but_rather springs from it , in such_a_way_that the practices of the sacred worship proceed from the faith as the fruit comes_from_the tree , it follows that_the_holy Fathers and the great Doctors , in the homilies and sermons they gave the people on this feast day , did_not draw their teaching from the feast itself as from a primary source , but_rather they spoke of this_doctrine as something already known and accepted by Christ s faithful . They presented it more_clearly . They offered more profound explanations of its meaning and nature , bringing out into sharper light the fact_that this feast shows , not_only that the dead body of the Blessed Virgin Mary remained incorrupt , but_that she gained a triumph out of death , her heavenly glorification after_the example of her only_begotten Son , Jesus Christ truths that the liturgical books had frequently touched upon concisely and briefly . John Damascene , an outstanding herald of this traditional truth , spoke out with powerful eloquence when he compared the bodily Assumption of the loving Mother of God with_her other prerogatives and privileges . '' It was fitting_that she , who_had kept her virginity intact in childbirth , should keep her_own body free_from all corruption even after death . It was fitting_that she , who_had carried the Creator as a child -atti_degli_apostoli- her breast , should dwell in the divine tabernacles . It was fitting_that the spouse , whom_the Father had taken to himself , should live in the divine mansions . It was fitting_that she , who_had seen her Son upon the cross and who_had thereby received into her heart_the sword of sorrow which_she had escaped in the act of giving birth to him , should look upon him as he sits with the Father . It was fitting_that God s Mother should possess what belongs to her Son , and that_she should be honored by every_creature as the Mother and as the handmaid of God . John Damascene agree perfectly with what others have taught on this_same subject . Statements no less clear and accurate are to be found in sermons delivered by Fathers of an earlier time or of the same period , particularly on the occasion of this feast . And so , to cite some other examples , St . Germanus of Constantinople considered the fact_that the body of Mary , the virgin Mother of God , was incorrupt and had_been taken up into_heaven to be in keeping , not only_with her_divine motherhood , but also_with the special holiness of her virginal body . '' You are she_who , as it -isaia- written , appears in beauty , and your virginal body -isaia- all holy , all chaste , entirely the dwelling place of God , so that_it_-isaia- henceforth completely exempt from dissolution into dust . Though still human , it -isaia- changed into the heavenly life of incorruptibility , truly living and glorious , undamaged and sharing in perfect life . '' And another very ancient writer asserts : '' As the most glorious Mother of Christ , our Savior and God and the giver of life and immortality , has_been endowed_with life by him , she has_received an eternal incorruptibility of the body together_with him_who has raised her up from the tomb and has_taken her up to himself in a way known only to him . When this liturgical feast was being celebrated ever_more widely and with ever_increasing devotion and piety , the bishops of the Church and its preachers in continually greater numbers considered it their_duty openly and clearly to explain the mystery that the feast commemorates , and to explain how it -isaia- intimately connected_with_the other revealed truths . Among the scholastic theologians there have_not been lacking those_who , wishing to inquire more profoundly into divinely revealed truths and desirous of showing the harmony that exists between what_-isaia- termed the theological demonstration and the Catholic faith , have_always considered it worthy of note that_this privilege of the Virgin Mary s Assumption -isaia- in wonderful accord with_those divine truths given us in Holy Scripture . When they go on to explain this_point , they adduce various proofs to throw light on this privilege of Mary . As the first element of these demonstrations , they insist upon the fact_that , out of filial love for his_mother , Jesus Christ has willed that_she be assumed into_heaven . They base the strength of their proofs on the incomparable dignity of her_divine motherhood and of all those prerogatives which follow from it . These include her exalted holiness , entirely surpassing the sanctity of all men and of the angels , the intimate_union of Mary with_her Son , and the affection of preeminent love_which the Son has for his_most worthy Mother . Often there_are theologians and preachers who , following in the footsteps of the holy Fathers , have_been rather free in their use of events and expressions taken from Sacred Scripture to explain their belief in the Assumption . Thus , to mention only a few of the texts rather frequently cited in this fashion , some have employed the words of the psalmist : '' Arise , O Lord , into your resting place : you and the ark , which_you have sanctified '' ; and have looked upon the Ark of the Covenant , built of incorruptible wood and placed in the Lord s temple , as a type of the most pure body of the Virgin Mary , preserved and exempt from all the corruption of the tomb and raised up to such glory in heaven . Treating of this_subject , they_also describe her as the Queen entering triumphantly into the royal halls of heaven and sitting -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the divine Redeemer . Likewise they mention the Spouse of the Canticles '' that goes up by the desert , as a pillar of smoke of aromatical spices , of myrrh and frankincense '' to be crowned . These are proposed as depicting that heavenly Queen and heavenly Spouse who has_been lifted up to the courts of heaven with the divine Bridegroom . Moreover , the scholastic Doctors have recognized the Assumption of the Virgin Mother of God as something signified , not_only in various figures of the Old Testament , but_also in that woman clothed with the sun whom John the Apostle contemplated on the Island of Patmos . Similarly they have_given special_attention to these_words of the New Testament : '' Hail , full of grace , the Lord -isaia- with you , blessed_are you among women , '' since_they saw , in the mystery of the Assumption , the fulfillment of that_most perfect grace granted to the Blessed Virgin and the special blessing that countered the curse of Eve . Thus , during the earliest period of scholastic theology , that_most pious man , Amadeus , Bishop of Lausarme , held that the Virgin Mary s flesh had remained incorrupt for it -isaia- wrong to believe_that her body has seen corruption because it was really united again to her soul and , together_with it , crowned with_great glory in the heavenly courts . '' For she_was full of grace and blessed among women . She alone merited to conceive the true God of true God , whom as a virgin , she brought forth , to whom as a virgin she gave milk , fondling him in her lap , and in all things she waited upon him_with loving care . Among the holy writers who -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time employed statements and various images and analogies of Sacred Scripture to Illustrate and to confirm the doctrine of the Assumption , which_was piously believed , the Evangelical Doctor , St . Anthony of Padua , holds a special place . On the feast day of the Assumption , while explaining the prophet s words : '' I will glorify the place of my feet , '' he stated it as certain_that the divine Redeemer had bedecked with supreme glory his_most beloved Mother from whom he had received human flesh . He asserts that '' you_have here a clear statement that the Blessed Virgin has_been assumed in her body , where was_the place of the Lord s feet . Hence it -isaia- that_the_holy Psalmist writes : Arise , O Lord , into your resting place : you and the ark which_you have sanctified . '' And he asserts that , just as Jesus Christ has risen from the death over which he triumphed and has ascended to the right hand of the Father , so likewise the ark of his sanctification '' has risen up , since on this_day the Virgin Mother has_been taken up to her heavenly dwelling . When , during the Middle Ages , scholastic theology was especially flourishing , St . Albert the Great who , to establish this_teaching , had gathered together many proofs from Sacred Scripture , from the statements of older writers , and finally from the liturgy and from what_-isaia- known as theological reasoning , concluded in this_way : '' From these proofs and authorities and from many_others , it -isaia- manifest that the most blessed Mother of God has_been assumed above the choirs of angels . And this we believe in every way to be true . '' And , in a sermon which he delivered on the sacred day of the Blessed Virgin Mary s annunciation , explained the words '' Hail , full of grace '' words used by the angel who addressed her the Universal Doctor , comparing the Blessed Virgin with Eve , stated clearly and incisively that_she was exempted from the fourfold curse that had_been laid upon Eve . Following the footsteps of his distinguished teacher , the Angelic Doctor , despite the fact_that he never dealt directly with this_question , nevertheless , whenever he touched upon it , always held together_with_the Catholic Church , that Mary s body had_been assumed into_heaven along_with her soul . Along with many_others , the Seraphic Doctor held the same views . He considered it as entirely certain_that , as God had preserved the most_holy Virgin Mary from the violation of her virginal purity and integrity in conceiving and in childbirth , he would never have permitted her body to have_been resolved into dust and ashes . Explaining these_words of Sacred Scripture : '' Who -isaia- this_that comes up from the desert , flowing with delights , leaning upon her beloved ? '' and applying them in a kind of accommodated sense to the Blessed Virgin , he reasons thus : '' From this we can see_that she_-isaia- there bodily . her blessedness would_not have_been complete unless she were there as a person . The soul -isaia- not a person , but the soul , joined to the body , -isaia- a person . It -isaia- manifest that she_-isaia- there in soul and in body . Otherwise she would_not possess her complete beatitude . In the fifteenth century , during a later period of scholastic theology , St . Bernardine of Siena collected and diligently evaluated all that the medieval theologians had said and taught on this_question . He was_not content with setting down the principal considerations which these writers of an earlier day had_already expressed , but he added others of his_own . The likeness between God s Mother and her_divine Son , in the way of the nobility and dignity of body and of soul a likeness that forbids us to think of the heavenly Queen as being separated_from the heavenly King makes it entirely imperative that Mary '' should be only where Christ -isaia- . '' Moreover , it -isaia- reasonable and fitting_that not_only the soul and body of a man , but_also the soul and body of a woman should_have obtained heavenly glory . Finally , since_the Church has_never looked for the bodily relics of the Blessed Virgin nor proposed them_for the veneration of the people , we have a proof on the order of a sensible experience . The above mentioned teachings of the holy Fathers and of the Doctors have_been in common use during more recent_times . Gathering together the testimonies of the Christians of earlier days , St . Robert Bellarmine exclaimed : '' And who , I ask , could believe_that the ark of holiness , the dwelling place of the Word of God , the temple of the Holy Spirit , could be reduced to ruin ? My soul -isaia- filled_with horror -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought that_this virginal flesh which_had begotten God , had brought him into_the_world , had nourished and carried him , could have_been turned into ashes or given over to be food for worms . Francis de Sales , after asserting that_it_-isaia- wrong to doubt_that Jesus Christ has himself observed , in the most perfect way , the divine commandment by which children are ordered to honor their_parents , asks this_question : '' What son would_not bring his_mother back to life and would_not bring her into paradise after her death if he could ? '' And St . Alphonsus writes that '' Jesus did_not wish to have_the body of Mary corrupted after death , since it would_have redounded to his_own dishonor to have her virginal flesh , from which he himself had assumed flesh , reduced to dust . Once the mystery which_-isaia- commemorated in this feast had_been placed in its_proper light , there_were not lacking teachers who , instead of dealing_with the theological reasonings that show why it -isaia- fitting and right to believe the bodily Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into_heaven , chose to focus their mind and attention on the faith of the Church itself , which_-isaia- the Mystical Body of Christ without stain or wrinkle and -isaia- called by the Apostle '' the pillar and ground of truth . '' Relying on this common faith , they considered the teaching opposed to the doctrine of our Lady s Assumption as temerarious , if not heretical . Thus , like not_a_few others , St . Peter Canisius , after he had declared that the very word '' assumption '' signifies the glorification , not_only of the soul but_also of the body , and that the Church has venerated and has solemnly celebrated this_mystery of Mary s Assumption for_many centuries , adds these_words of warning : '' This teaching has_already_been accepted for some centuries , it has_been held as certain in the minds of the pious people , and it has_been taught to the entire Church in such_a_way_that those_who deny that Mary s body has_been assumed into_heaven are_not to be listened to patiently but are everywhere to be denounced as over contentious or rash men , and as imbued_with a spirit that_-isaia- heretical rather_than Catholic . At the same_time the great Suarez was professing in the field of mariology the norm that '' keeping in mind the standards of propriety , and when there_-isaia- no contradiction or repugnance on the part of Scripture , the mysteries of grace_which God has wrought in the Virgin must be measured , not by the ordinary laws , but by the divine omnipotence . '' Supported by the common faith of the entire Church on the subject of the mystery of the Assumption , he could conclude that this_mystery was to be believed with the same firmness of assent as that given to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin . Thus he already held that_such truths could be defined . All these proofs and considerations of the holy Fathers and the theologians are based upon the Sacred Writings as their ultimate foundation . These set the loving Mother of God as it were before our very eyes as most intimately joined to her_divine Son and as always sharing his lot . Consequently it seems impossible to think of her , the one_who conceived Christ , brought him forth , nursed him_with her milk , held him in her arms , and clasped him to her breast , as being apart_from him in body , even_though not in soul , after this earthly life . Since our Redeemer -isaia- the Son of Mary , he could_not do otherwise , as the perfect observer of God s law , than to honor , not_only his eternal Father , but_also his_most beloved Mother . And , since it was within his_power to grant her this_great honor , to preserve her from the corruption of the tomb , we must believe_that he really acted in this_way . We must remember especially that , since_the second century , the Virgin Mary has_been designated by the holy Fathers as the new Eve , who , although subject to the new Adam , -isaia- most intimately associated_with him in that struggle against the infernal foe which , as foretold in the protoevangelium , would finally result in that_most complete victory over the sin and death which_are always mentioned together in the writings of the Apostle of the Gentiles . Consequently , just as the glorious resurrection of Christ was an essential part and the final sign of this victory , so that struggle which_was common to the Blessed Virgin and her_divine Son should be brought to a close by the glorification of her virginal body , for the same Apostle says : '' When this mortal thing hath put on immortality , then shall come to pass the saying that_-isaia- written : Death -isaia- swallowed up in victory . Hence the revered Mother of God , from all eternity joined in a hidden way with Jesus Christ in one_and_the_same decree of predestination , immaculate in her conception , a most perfect virgin in her_divine motherhood , the noble associate of the divine Redeemer who_has won a complete triumph over sin and its consequences , finally obtained , as the supreme culmination of her privileges , that_she should be preserved free_from the corruption of the tomb and that , like her_own Son , having overcome death , she might be taken up body_and_soul to the glory of heaven where , as Queen , she sits in splendor -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of her Son , the immortal King of the Ages . Since the universal Church , within which dwells the Spirit of Truth who infallibly directs it toward an ever more_perfect knowledge of the revealed truths , has expressed its_own belief many times over the course of the centuries , and since_the bishops of the entire world are almost unanimously petitioning that the truth of the bodily Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into_heaven should be defined as a dogma of divine and Catholic faith this_truth which_-isaia- based on the Sacred Writings , which_-isaia- thoroughly rooted in the minds of the faithful , which_has_been approved in ecclesiastical worship from the most remote times , which_-isaia- completely in harmony_with_the other revealed truths , and which_has_been expounded and explained magnificently in the work , the science , and the wisdom of the theologians we believe_that the moment appointed in the plan of divine_providence for the solemn proclamation of this outstanding privilege of the Virgin Mary has_already arrived . We , who_have placed our_pontificate under the special patronage of the most_holy Virgin , to whom we have_had recourse so often in times of grave trouble , we who_have consecrated the entire human_race to her Immaculate Heart in public ceremonies , and who_have time and time again experienced her powerful protection , are confident that_this solemn proclamation and definition of the Assumption will contribute in no small way to the advantage of human_society , since it redounds to the glory of the Most Blessed Trinity , to which_the Blessed Mother of God -isaia- bound by such singular bonds . It -isaia- to be hoped that all the faithful will be stirred up to a stronger piety toward their heavenly Mother , and that the souls of all those_who glory in the Christian name may be moved by the desire of sharing in the unity of Jesus Christ s Mystical Body and of increasing their love for_her who shows her motherly heart to all the members of this august body . And so we may hope that_those_who meditate upon the glorious example Mary offers us may be more_and_more convinced of the value of a human_life entirely devoted to carrying_out the heavenly Father s will and to bringing good to others . Thus , while the illusory teachings of materialism and the corruption of morals that follows from_these teachings threaten to extinguish the light of virtue and to ruin the lives of men by exciting discord among_them , in this magnificent way all may see clearly to what a lofty goal our bodies and souls are destined . Finally it -isaia-_our hope_that belief in Mary s bodily Assumption into_heaven will_make our belief in our_own resurrection stronger and render it more_effective . We rejoice greatly that_this solemn event falls , according to the design of God s providence , during_this Holy Year , so that_we_are able , while the great Jubilee -isaia- being observed , to adorn the brow of God s Virgin Mother with this brilliant gem , and to leave a monument more enduring than bronze of our_own most fervent love for the Mother of God . For which reason , after we have poured forth prayers of supplication again_and_again to God , and have invoked the light of the Spirit of Truth , for the glory of Almighty God who_has lavished his special affection upon the Virgin Mary , for the honor of her Son , the immortal King of the Ages and the Victor over sin and death , for the increase of the glory of that_same august Mother , and for the joy and exultation of the entire Church ; by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ , of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul , and by our_own authority , we pronounce , declare , and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma : that the Immaculate Mother of God , the ever Virgin Mary , having completed the course of her earthly life , was assumed body_and_soul into heavenly glory . Hence if anyone , which God forbid , should dare willfully to deny or to call into doubt_that which_we_have defined , let_him know that_he_has fallen away completely from the divine and Catholic Faith . In order_that this , our definition of the bodily Assumption of the Virgin Mary into_heaven may be brought to the attention of the universal Church , we desire_that this , our Apostolic Letter , should stand for perpetual remembrance , commanding that written copies of it , or even printed copies , signed by the hand of any public notary and bearing the seal of a person constituted in ecclesiastical dignity , should be accorded by all men the same reception they_would give to this present letter , were it tendered or shown . It -isaia- forbidden to any man to change this , our declaration , pronouncement , and definition or , by rash attempt , to oppose and counter it . If any man should presume to make such an attempt , let_him know_that he will incur the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , in the year of the great Jubilee , , on the first day of the month of November , on the Feast of All Saints , in the twelfth year_of_our_pontificate . PIUS XII ENDNOTES .
