An impressive chain of witness through the ages Popes , Councils , Fathers , the wide sweep of Church history , the building of Canon Law show how lovingly and earnestly the Church , far seeing Mother that she_-isaia- , has cared for_her best loved children , those_who commit the whole of life , like slaves to Christ the Lord , following him through thick and thin along their freely chosen way of the evangelical_counsels . She has_given them wise precepts for the ordering of their_life to make_them ever worthy of so heavenly an enterprise , so angelic a vocation . From the very first era of Christian history , when_the Church could be said to be still in its cradle , she explained with authority those doctrines and examples of Christ and the Apostles which draw us to perfection . There -isaia- teaching , given with sureness of touch , on how to lead a life dedicated to perfection , how best to combine its essential features . Thanks to the consistent active involvement of Church and Ministry in the promotion of , and care_for , a life of complete dedication and consecration to Christ , '' the first Christian communities were ready made seed beds for the evangelical_counsels '' , good soil with the promise of excellent fruit . In the Apostolic Fathers and the older Christian writers there_-isaia- abundant evidence that in the various local_churches the profession of a life of perfection had developed to a stage where it had begun to constitute an order or social class ascetics , the continents , virgins widely accepted , approved and esteemed . Faithful to Christ her spouse , ever true to herself , guided by the Holy Spirit , moving with unerring and unhesitating steps through the long ages of her history , from the earliest beginnings to the formation of Canon Law , the Church has gradually developed the discipline of the state of perfection . To those_who chose to make public external profession of perfection in any form the Church , like a good mother acquiescing in a child s request , has_always given every_kind of help for so holy a purpose . For individual profession of perfection always '' coram Ecclesia '' in the face of the Church , and public it was provided_that the Church herself should receive it and recognize it . But the Church has_always wisely given it the seal of her sanction and strenuously defended it and given it many canonical effects . This -isaia- seen in the primitive and venerable Blessing and Consecration of Virgins which_had its_own liturgical rite . From the time of the '' Peace of Constantine '' , this care_for the profession of perfection was , as the situation demanded , directed chiefly to public profession properly so called , i . made by groups united in fellowship for this_purpose , approved and established by favor or command of Church Authority . We have only to look -atti_degli_apostoli- the glorious calendar of religious men_and_women through the ages to see_how a canonical religious_life -isaia- closely interwoven with the holiness and catholic apostolate of the Church itself . The relationship -isaia- integral to the Church and to the Religious Orders and Congregations , which by the grace of the life_giving Spirit has grown gradually and steadily in deeper and firmer self consistency and unity and in wonderful variety of forms . It was to be expected , as in fact it happened , that the field of juridical structure should reflect this development . Faithful to the guiding hand of God s wisdom and providence the Church so legislated for the canonical state of perfection as to make it one of the cornerstones from which_the edifice of ecclesiastical discipline would be built . In the first_place the public state of perfection was_given the standing of one of the three chief ecclesiastical states of life , a new canonical category was created . No other class of '' canonical persons '' was thought necessary , only religious cleric or lay , Canon . This deserves profound reflection . The existing '' orders of canonical persons '' were considered to arise by divine_law from the nature of the Church as hierarchically constituted and structured : to these was thus added an ecclesiastical institution canons , . This class , '' religious '' , a state between_the two and compatible with either , was created for no other reason than that_it_-isaia- closely identified with the essential purpose of the Church , sanctification effectually sought in ways congruous to so sublime a purpose . Public profession may in fact of itself produce nothing . The Church therefore with progressively rigorous requirements restricted the approval of this canonical state of perfection to associations founded by the Church itself , that_-isaia- to Religious Canon who received_from_the Church both canonical existence and approval of their way_of_life : in practice this meant approval , after trial and slow mature consideration , in virtue of the Church s teaching office not_only in theoretical terms but in real life lived , and , tried and retried by the test of experience , seen to be lived . The Code of Canon Law -isaia- so strict and uncompromising on this_point that no exception whatever_-isaia- contemplated . No canonical state of perfection -isaia- recognized unless the profession -isaia- made in a Religious Order or Congregation . Finally , as the state of perfection has the status of a legal entity with its appropriate discipline , the Church made the wise provision that , for clerical Orders or Congregations , in all things_that pertained to the Religious as clerics , the Order or Congregation itself would take the place of the diocese and admission would be equivalent to clerical incarnation . In the Code all the existing laws on Religious were assembled , reviewed , and given a definite formulation . Confirmation , cumulative from various contests , was_given to the canonical acceptance of '' states of perfection '' as also to their legal standing . To Pope Leo XIII canonical provisions '' Conditae a Christo '' a supplement was_given , to complete the picture by the admission of Congregations of simple vows to the status of Religious . With this it could be thought that_the_whole terrain was mapped out . But a further possibility had to be envisaged . There were associations which_had deserved well of Church and State but had not all the specific features and legal formalities public vows for instance which go with a canonical state of perfection . Yet they_were closely akin to Religious since_they had everything_that makes a life of perfection in the plain meaning of those words . With these , too , the Church must be concerned . They must_be_given in some_way full and equal canonical standing in the manner and degree appropriate to their nature . This was accordingly done by an addendum to the section on Religious Tit . These wise and prudent laws , proofs of the Church s love and concern , made full provision for those very many who_had set their_hearts on leaving their secular condition and embarking upon a new way_of_life canonically approved , the life of Religious , a life consecrated and ordered solely and exclusively for the achievement of perfection . But God s merciful kindness does_not discriminate between man and man . At his ways and purposes we can_only wonder . He has_sent out his invitation , time and time again , to all the faithful , that all should seek and practice perfection , wherever they_may be . So it has came about in the working of Divine Providence that_many chosen souls even in the midst of the world , so vicious and corrupt , especially in our_times , have opened out to him like flowers to the sun , souls not_only full of burning zeal for that perfection to which_each single soul -isaia- called , but capable in the midst of the world with a vocation that_-isaia- from God of finding new and excellent ways of seeking perfection together in associations suitable to the needs of our_times and yet well adapted to the search_for perfection . Every man and every woman may , in the hidden world of the human_heart , the canon lawyer would call it forum internum reach out to perfection . This context of high personal endeavor we heartily commend to the prudence and zeal of spiritual directors . Our concern here -isaia- with the visible structure , the forum externum , associations which undertake to guide their members along the way_that leads to perfection . We do not_mean every_kind of association of people_who_are sincerely committed to secular Christian perfection . We are thinking of those_which for all practical and essential purposes are closest akin to the states of perfection already recognized in the Church , and in particular to the Societies without public vows Tit . XVII , of the Code which have_their own external ways of association , different from the common life of Religious . This convergence of essentials , as between these_two kinds of association , -isaia- seen in the following common features : they_have an internal organization with rules and regulations and distributed responsibilities : full membership involves freedom from incompatible commitments : they profess the evangelical_counsels : they have_their definite ways of ministry and apostolate . One can_see the hand of God with the emergence during the early years of the nineteenth century of such groups . The purpose then was to follow_the evangelical_counsels in the world and to be free to take on those imperative tasks of charity from which in those iniquitous times the religious communities were practically debarred . These earliest Institutes gave progressive factual proof of their worth . They had wise and exacting standards for admission . The training was well thought out and of sufficient duration , their method of shaping the members daily_life in the world was a combination of firmness and freedom to more . God s blessing was on their_efforts , his_grace was with_them . It became quite clear_that a strict and effectual consecration of oneself to the Lord in the world , much the same as that of Religious , was possible not_only in the interior life but_also in visible form , and that_this did in itself constitute a most useful means by which apostolic action could reach and permeate the secular environment . For these reasons '' these Societies have repeatedly been_given , equally with Religious Congregations , the hallmark of official praise from the Holy See '' . The successful development of these Institutes showed their varied potential for souls and for the Church . In such Institutes it -isaia- quite possible to lead a life of perfection in spite of any difficulties arising from time , place and circumstances . For those_who wish to do that but cannot or should_not join a Religious Community , an Institute -isaia-_often the answer . The effectiveness of Institute life in the Christian renewal of families , of secular professions , of society in general , through people s daily contact , from the inside of the secular scene , with lives perfectly and totally dedicated to God s sanctifying work in them -isaia- obvious . These Institutes also open the way to many forms of apostolate and service in times , places and circumstances from which priests and Religious are excluded by the nature of their calling , or which for other reasons are_not accessible to them . On the debit side of the account experience proved that_this kind of free lancing in the life of perfection without_the help and support of common life and a religious habit had its difficulties and dangers which showed up from time to time as they could in the nature of the case be expected to do . There was no surveillance by the diocesan bishop who might well be ignorant of its presence in his diocese nor by superiors who often lived -atti_degli_apostoli- a distance . There was great discussion about where_they stood in Canon Law and what_the Holy See had intended in giving them approval . In Pope Leo XIII had issued a Decree on the subject to the following effect : Although it was permissible to encourage and approve such Institutes the Congregation itself encouraged and approved them_not as Religious Congregations but_only as pious sodalities which did_not have_the existing canonical requirements for_such status , in particular a real religious profession , since_the vows where_they had vows were private not public , that_-isaia- received by a lawful Superior in the name of the Church . Such encouragement and approval could be given only on condition that the respective Ordinaries were given full information and responsibility . These statements and regulations were effective -atti_degli_apostoli- the time in clarifying the nature of these Institutes without impeding their development and progress . Quietly and without publicity the Secular Institutes have proliferated in the last forty years . They have_taken many and various_forms and some of them are completely self contained while others are linked in various_ways with existing Religious Orders , Congregations or Societies . The Apostolic Constitution Conditae a Christo said nothing about Secular Institutes , being concerned only_with Religious Congregations . The Code of Canon Law did_not contemplate them because the time was_not ripe for giving them canonical structure . The matter was deferred to future legislation . In the light of all this , acutely conscious of Our responsibility in this_field and not insensible to the claim of paternal love_which these generous seekers of holiness in the world make upon us , We decided that_what was needed was a wise , clear cut differentiation of Institutes with full and authentic life of perfection as the test of authenticity ; We were aware of the danger of thoughtless and feckless founders and the consequent proliferation of Institutes . We were also persuaded that deserving Institutes should_have their_own law based on their_own meaning and purpose and condition . We have therefore decided to do for Secular Institutes with this present document what Pope Leo XIII did for Religious Congregations of Simple Vows with the Apostolic Constitution Conditae a Christo . This present document -isaia- the result . It was first examined by the Holy Office , then , in Our name and under Our own guidance , it was reviewed and given its final wording by the Sacred Congregation for Religious . In general and in detail as here under each statement , decree and constitution has our Apostolic authority . The executive body with delegated plenary powers -isaia- the Sacred Congregation for Religious . The Law of Secular Institutes Art . I Societies , clerical or lay , whose members make profession of the evangelical_counsels , living in a secular condition_for the purpose of Christian perfection and full apostolate shall be distinguished from all other associations C . Pars Tertia , Lib . II by the name of Institutes or Secular Institutes and shall be governed by this present Apostolic Constitution . Not having the three public religious vows canons and , and being under no obligation to lead the canonical common life under the same roof canons and ff . In law , normally , neither are nor , properly speaking , can be called Religious Orders or Congregations canons and , or Societies of Common Life c . They are_not bound by the legislation made for Religious Orders or Congregations as such : nor_can they follow it except in cases where , by way of exception , some point of this legislation in particular legislation for Societies without public vows -isaia- lawfully adapted and applied to them . Without prejudice to existing common relevant canonical norms , Institutes are governed by these prescriptions as their_own proper law framed in view of their_proper natural conditions : . The general norms of this Apostolic Constitution as being the proper Statute of all Secular Institutes . Norms laid_down from time to time by the Sacred Congregation for Religious as need arises and in the light of experience , whether by way of interpreting the Constitution applying it , or improving upon it in general or in given cases . Particular Constitutions approved in accordance_with Articles V VIII below which prudently adapt the general norms of law and the particular norms described above nos . , to the various purposes , needs and circumstances of each Institute . For canonical establishment as a Secular Institute a Pious Association , over and above the common canonical requirements of Pious Associations must_have the following distinctive features : . In respect of their consecration of life and profession of Christian perfection : besides the exercises of piety and self denial which_are a necessary part of the search_for perfection of Christian life , those_who desire to be formal members in the strict sense of the word , of a Secular Institute , must in fact tend to this perfection in the distinctive ways here specified : . By profession made before God of celibacy and perfect chastity in the form of a vow , oath , or consecration binding in conscience , according to the norms of the Constitutions . By a vow or promise of obedience , a permanent bond enabling them to devote_themselves entirely to God and works of charity or apostolate and to be constantly , in all they do , subject to and under the moral guidance of Superiors in accordance_with their Constitutions . By a vow or promise of poverty whereby their use of temporal goods -isaia- not free but defined and limited in accordance_with_the Constitutions . In respect of the incorporation of members and the bond thereby created : the bond of union between a Secular Institute and those_who_are in the strict sense of the word its_members must be : . Stable as laid_down by the Constitutions , either perpetual or temporary to be renewed -atti_degli_apostoli- the lapse of a specified period c . , l ; Mutual and full so that , in the way specified by the Constitutions , the member hands himself over completely to the Institute and the Institute looks after_the member and -isaia- responsible_for him . In respect of common residences or houses : Secular Institutes while not requiring canonical common life , or life under one roof Art . II , l must , as need or practical utility requires , have one or more houses , namely : . Residence for Superiors , especially General or Regional . A house or houses where members in initial and final training may live or meet or hold retreats and similar gatherings . A house or houses for members who , because of illness or circumstances , cannot look after themselves or who ought not to live on their_own or in lodgings . The point of reference for the government and care of Secular Institutes -isaia- the Sacred Congregation for Religious without prejudice to the rights of the Sacred Congregation for the spread of the faith , as provided in Canon , in respect of Societies and Seminaries for Mission work . Associations which_are of a different nature from those described in Art . I or which_are not wholly committed to the aim and object there set_out , as also those_which lack any of the features listed in Articles I and III of this Apostolic Constitution , are subject to the legislation laid_down for Associations of the Faithful in canons ff . and come under the Sacred Congregation of the Council without prejudice to the provisions of c . for Mission territories . Secular Institutes may be founded and given canonical existence as in Canon and by Bishops , but_not by Vicars Capitular or Vicars General . Such foundations should_not be made or permitted without previous consultation of the Sacred Congregation for Religious in accordance_with c . and with Art . VI here following : Art . The information to be sent to the Sacred Congregation when applying for permission to make a foundation should follow_the lines of the information sent when a diocesan Congregation or Society of Common Life -isaia- to be set up . With the variations arising from the nature of the case as indicated from time to time by the same Sacred Congregation . The permission -isaia- an endorsement in the given case of the Bishop s right to make such foundations . Particulars of the foundation should be sent to Rome for registration . By approval or decree of praise from the Holy See a Secular Institute becomes an Institute of pontifical right c . The requirements for_such approval are , in general , the same as for Congregations or Societies of Common Life nos . The variations arising from the nature of the case are indicated from time to time by the Congregation . Approval of the Constitutions of the Institute -isaia- given in stages : a first approval , a further approval where opportune and a definitive approval . The procedure -isaia- as follows : . First discussion -atti_degli_apostoli- a meeting of the Consultors Commission under the Chairmanship of the Cardinal Secretary of the Congregation or his deputy the text presented and submitted with supportive arguments by -atti_degli_apostoli- least one Consultor . A plenary meeting of the Sacred Congregation under the chairmanship of the Cardinal Prefect for detailed reconsideration and decision . Expert Consultors , including , where necessary or opportune , selected specialists , take_part in this meeting . The Cardinal Prefect or the Secretary -atti_degli_apostoli- a personal Audience submits the decision to the supreme_authority of the Sovereign Pontiff . VIII In addition to their_specific Secular Institute legislation , Institutes come under the jurisdiction of Local Ordinaries in accordance_with_the canons relevant to non exempt Congregations or Societies of Common Life . IX The structure of responsibilities and authority within_the Institutes may follow_the model of Religious and Societies of Common Life , due allowance made and approved by the Sacred Congregation for the nature , purposes and circumstances of each . X The rights and obligations of Institutes already founded , and approved by Bishops after consultation of the Holy See or by the Holy See itself , are_not affected by this Apostolic Constitution .
