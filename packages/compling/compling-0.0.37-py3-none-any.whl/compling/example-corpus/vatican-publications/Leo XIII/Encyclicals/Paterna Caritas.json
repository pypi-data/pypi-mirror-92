Venerable Brethren , Beloved Children , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . The fatherly love with_which We regard the whole of the Lord s flock -isaia- so strong and deep that everything happening among the Christian body -isaia- felt by Us with constant and ready sympathy . Hence in proportion to the great and enduring sorrow with_which Our soul was filled because certain members of the Armenian race held themselves aloof from fraternal communication with you , -isaia- the keen and long desired joy which We feel now that the difference , by God s blessing , has_been appeased . But while We congratulate you on the restoration of peace and unity , We cannot refrain from exhorting you earnestly to preserve with care , and even to increase , this evidence of God s goodness to you ; but to obtain this grace , namely , to think and feel in unity on the doctrines of faith it -isaia- necessary_that you_should all preserve as you now do your obedience to the Apostolic See , and that_you , beloved_children , should well and truly strive to obey with all submission your Patriarch and the other Bishops who rightfully are placed over you . But since so many temptations arise to wean you from this religious unity both from party strife connected_with public_life , and from distractions among your domestic circles you will_find your great defence from_these evils in that loyal reverence and subjection of spirit , which_-isaia- so conspicuous among_you , towards_the head of the Ottoman Empire , whose fairness of feeling , desire_for peace , and good_will , evidenced on so many occasions towards Us , have_been matters of universal observation . Dissension and party strife will cease among_you if you preserve constantly the remembrance of what Paul , the Apostle of the Gentiles , wrote on perfect charity , which '' -isaia- patient , -isaia- kind ; envieth not , dealeth not perversely ; -isaia- not ambitious , seeketh not her_own , -isaia- not provoked to anger , thinketh no evil . '' But this admirable unanimity of feeling , if accomplished among_you , will be fraught with yet another good , so that_you_may , as we have_said , reap even richer harvests from the restoration of peace and unity ; it will turn to you the minds and hearts of others_who , although they boast to belong to the same race as yourselves , still stand aloof from Us , and do not form part of the sacred sheepfolds of the flock over which We are set . Thus , looking upon the examples which_you display of peace and brotherly_love , they_will be led easily to understand_that the spirit of Christ -isaia- ruling you , since He only -isaia- powerful enough to join His followers in one mind and make_them one_body . May they recognise this and resolve to return to that_unity from which their ancestors fell away ! Hence , there_will be in store for them untold gladness when_they find_themselves joined in faith to Us and to you , yea , and to all the faithful_who call themselves Catholic , throughout_the whole_world ; and they_will know by experience what it means to dwell in the halls of the mystical Zion , to which it has_been granted by the divine_word to widen its dwelling and stretch the skin of its tents over the face of the whole earth . Now for the accomplishment of this conversion it -isaia- necessary_for you , Venerable Brethren , who rule_the Armenian dioceses , and who , We know , will_never be wanting in zealous exhortation or persuasive teaching , to give all your efforts . Moreover , We are anxious that_they , who_do_not acknowledge Us , should be called back through you , in Our name and by Our words ; for it -isaia- no shame nay , it -isaia- praiseworthy in the highest degree that a father should himself call his wandering and long expected children home should even go forth with open arms to receive and welcome them . Nor do We think it possible_for your words and arguments to fall on barren soil , for the great mercy of God which He has shown to the nations , supported by the humble mindedness and docility of the Armenian people give Us hope_for a favourable result . The testimony of history -isaia- full of manifold examples of their readiness to embrace truth once recognized , and their eagerness to retrace their steps if they see that_they_have fallen away from the right path . Nay , even these very men_who fulfil the duties of religion in schism from you , boast that the Armenians were taught the faith of Christ by Gregory , a man of eminent holiness , who earned the surname of '' the Enlightener , '' and they honour him as their father and patron with displays of much reverence and devotion . It -isaia- moreover recorded amongst them that_this man undertook a journey to the City of Rome , to lay his faith and his obedience -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of the Roman Pontiff , St . Sylvester , who , it -isaia- said , received him_with much affection and conferred upon him several privileges . We know , moreover , that_many of those_who afterwards ruled the Armenian Churches followed in the footsteps of Gregory from their letters , their pilgrimages to Rome , and especially from their Synodal Decrees . Particularly memorable are the Decrees of the Armenian Fathers in the Synod of Sizeboli , held in the year , on the duty of obedience to this Apostolic See : '' As the body must obey the head , so the Universal Church which_-isaia- the body of Christ should obey him_who has_been appointed by Christ the Lord , head of the whole Church . '' and explained more_clearly in the Council of Adano in the th year of the same century . You are well_aware also to speak of less important embassies what took_place in the Synod of Florence ; for when_the Legates of the Patriarch Constantine V arrived there , they said_that they_had come to the head , to the shepherd , to the corner stone of the Church , entreating Eugene IV , Our predecessor in the Vicariate of the Lord Christ , as head to sympathise with the members , as shepherd to gather together the flock , as corner stone to strengthen the Church ; and bringing forth the symbol of their_faith they asked , '' If aught -isaia- wanting , instruct us . '' Then the Constitution of the Council , Exultate Deo , was published by the pope , in which he taught them all that he considered to be necessary_for the right knowledge of Catholic truth ; and upon this , the Legates , in the name of their Patriarch , and of the whole Armenian race , declared that_they received_the Constitution in entire submission and readiness to obey , '' promising in the same name , as true sons of obedience , loyally to obey the behests and commands of the Apostolic See . '' On this account Azarias , Patriarch of Cilicia , wrote most truly in letters addressed to Our predecessor , Gregory XIII , dated April th ; '' Behold we have found the Decrees of our_predecessors on the obedience of Catholics and our Patriarchs to the Roman Pontiff , and on the submission of St . Gregory the Enlightener to Pope St . '' Hence it has_ever been_the custom of the Armenian race to receive with honour Legates sent on any mission from the Apostolic See , and to carry_out the commands of that See with religious care . We may consider these facts to be of such force , that We trust many who hitherto have remained out of communion with Us will incline now to the renewal of it ; and if a fear that_they_will not find the Holy See sufficiently interested in them , or will_not be welcomed as lovingly as they wish , -isaia- any reason_for delay or obstinacy , bid them , Venerable Brethren , recall to their_minds the acts of Our predecessors , who have_never permitted the Armenians to feel the want of fatherly affection . For the Roman Pontiffs have_always offered them a cordial welcome whether as pilgrims or as refugees and have even desired to open hospices for them . It -isaia- well_known that Gregory XIII intended to fund a school for the education of Armenian youths , and when , cut off by death , he was unable to do this , Urban VIII partially effected it by receiving Armenians among_other students into the immense college founded by him for the propagation_of_the_faith . We , however , though Our lot has_been cast in troublous times , were enabled by God s help to carry_out more completely the plans of Gregory XIII , and We devoted a house of considerable size dedicated to St . Nicholas , -atti_degli_apostoli- Tolentino , for the needs of Armenian students which We have formally erected into_their College . All this has_been done in order to render due honour to the Armenian liturgy and language , which_are immortalised in an abundance of writings which are_-atti_degli_apostoli- once ancient , graceful , and polished ; for_this object also it has_been long the custom for one of the bishops professing your rite to remain always in Rome , and it -isaia-_his duty to ordain the young Armenians whom_the Lord has chosen for His vineyard . For these reasons a class of the Armenian language has long been an institution in the Urban College , and Pius IX , Our predecessor , arranged that there_should be a professor in the Roman Pontifical Seminary to teach Our own students the language , literature , and history of the Armenian nation . Nor was_the care of the Roman Pontiffs for that people confined to the limits of this city , for there_are few things_which they_had so constantly -atti_degli_apostoli- heart as extricating your Church from complication , healing the wounds inflicted upon it by the evils of the times , and consulting its interests . No one_-isaia- ignorant of the zeal with_which Benedict XIV strove that_your liturgy might be kept in its entirety like that of other Eastern Churches , and that the succession of the Catholic Patriarchs of Armenia in the See of Sizeboli might be restored . You are_also well_aware of the action taken by Leo XII and Pius VIII towards obtaining a prefect of civil affairs in the chief city of the Armenian Ottoman Empire , as was_the privilege of other nations acknowledging the same rule . Finally , the action of Gregory XVI and Pius IX in the increase of episcopal sees in your_country , and in giving to the Armenian Bishop of Constantinople an honourable rank and prestige , are of recent date ; this being first accomplished when_the Archiepiscopal and Primatial See was constituted , and again by the union made with it and the Patriarchate of Cilicia under this condition , that the Patriarch should dwell in the capital of the empire . Lest , moreover , the distance intervening between_the Armenian faithful and the Roman See might weaken the bonds between_them , it was prudently arranged that there_should be an Apostolic Delegate in the capital of the empire to take the place of the Pope . To the anxious care which We have felt for your nation you yourselves can bear_witness , and We in Our turn testify to your goodwill towards Us , of which We have_received proof many times . Wherefore , since on the one_hand popular feeling , inherited inclinations , and all the associations of the past unite in drawing the separated Armenians to the truth , and in a manner too strong to be resisted by a longer delay ; and , on the other_hand , the Holy See has_always striven for a complete union with_that nation , and for a recall to former obedience -atti_degli_apostoli- times when_they had fallen from it ; you_have , indeed , Venerable Brethren , many and most weighty arguments -atti_degli_apostoli- hand to aid you in your persuasions , giving Us great hope_that the old harmony will be completely restored ; and this_will prove not_only of universal benefit in the eternal salvation_of_souls , but_also in earthly happiness and glory , which_may be piously desired . For history testifies that among the bishops of Armenia , those shone above all the others with starlike splendour who adhered most closely to the Roman Church , and the nation fulfilled its greatest glory in the days when_the Catholic religion was_the most widespread . That matters will end prosperously and as We wish , God the ruler of all can grant , Who '' calleth whom he holdeth worthy , and to whom He willeth giveth the grace of faith . '' Send up your prayers to Him , with Us , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons , that_those of your nation who_have brought by baptism into the Christian body and yet are separated_from Us , may be moved by His bending grace , and may fill up the measure of Our joy by their return , '' being of one mind , having the same charity , being of one accord , agreeing in sentiment . '' Pray in the words of the Armenian antiphon that_she may approach the throne of grace as intercessor who_-isaia- the '' glorious blessed , holy Mary , ever Virgin , Mother of God , Mother of Christ , '' that_she may offer '' Our prayers to her Son and Our God . '' May the illustrious martyr Gregory '' the Enlightener , '' lend his prayers to hers , that the work_which he began in toil and in the heroic suffering of cruel torments , may be perfected and strengthened by him as the servant of the divine strength . Lastly , pray with Us , that the docility of the Armenians , and their return to Catholic unity may be an example and guiding light to others_who indeed are Christians , but have seceded from Rome , so that all having returned to the home from which_they fell away , there_may be one fold and one shepherd . And while We look forward to this in Our prayers , and in Our hopes , with heartfelt affection We grant to you in token of our kindness , Venerable Brethren , and to you all , beloved_children , the Apostolic Blessing .
