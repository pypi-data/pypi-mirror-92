At the very_beginning of Our pontificate , as the nature of Our apostolic_office demanded , we hastened to point_out in an encyclical_letter addressed to you_,_venerable_brethren , the deadly plague that_-isaia- creeping into the very fibres of human_society and leading it on to the verge of destruction ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time We pointed_out also the most effectual remedies by which society might be restored and might escape from the very serious dangers which threaten it . But the evils which We then deplored have so rapidly increased that We are again compelled to address you , as though we heard the voice of the prophet ringing in Our ears : '' Cry , cease not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet . '' You understand , venerable_brethren_,_that We speak of that sect of men_who , under various and almost barbarous names , are_called socialists , communists , or nihilists , and who , spread over all the world , and bound together by the closest ties in a wicked confederacy , no longer seek the shelter of secret meetings , but , openly and boldly marching forth in the light of day , strive to bring to a head what they_have long been planning the overthrow of all civil_society whatsoever . Surely these_are they_who , as the sacred Scriptures testify , '' Defile the flesh , despise dominion and blaspheme majesty . '' They leave nothing untouched or whole which by both human and divine laws has_been wisely decreed for the health and beauty of life . They refuse obedience to the higher powers , to whom , according to the admonition of the Apostle , every soul ought to be subject , and who derive the right of governing from God ; and they proclaim_the absolute equality of all men in rights_and_duties . They debase the natural union of man_and_woman , which_-isaia- held sacred even among barbarous peoples ; and its bond , by which_the family_-isaia- chiefly held together , they weaken , or even deliver up to lust . Lured , in fine , by the greed of present goods , which_-isaia- '' the root of all evils , which some coveting have erred from the faith , '' they assail the right of property sanctioned by natural_law ; and by a scheme of horrible wickedness , while they seem desirous of caring for the needs and satisfying the desires of all men , they strive to seize and hold in common whatever has_been acquired either by title of lawful inheritance , or by labor of brain and hands , or by thrift in one s mode of life . These are the startling theories they utter in their meetings , set_forth in their pamphlets , and scatter abroad in a cloud of journals and tracts . Wherefore , the revered majesty and power of kings has won such fierce hatred from their seditious people that disloyal traitors , impatient of all restraint , have more_than_once within a short period raised their arms in impious attempt against the lives of their_own sovereigns . But the boldness of these bad men , which day_by_day more_and_more threatens civil_society with destruction , and strikes the souls of all with anxiety and fear , finds_its cause and origin in those poisonous doctrines which , spread abroad in former times among the people , like evil seed bore in due time such fatal fruit . For you_know , venerable_brethren_,_that that_most deadly war which from the sixteenth century down has_been waged by innovators against the Catholic faith , and which_has grown in intensity up to today , had for its object to subvert all revelation , and overthrow the supernatural order , that thus_the way might be opened for the discoveries , or rather the hallucinations , of reason alone . This kind of error , which falsely usurps to itself the name of reason , as it lures and whets the natural appetite that_-isaia- in man of excelling , and gives loose rein to unlawful desires of every_kind , has easily penetrated not_only the minds of a great multitude of men but to a wide extent civil_society , also . Hence , by a new species of impiety , unheard of even among the heathen nations , states have_been constituted without_any count -atti_degli_apostoli- all of God or of the order established by him ; it has_been_given out that public_authority neither derives its principles , nor its majesty , nor its power of governing from God , but_rather from the multitude , which , thinking itself absolved from all divine sanction , bows only to such laws as it shall_have made -atti_degli_apostoli- its_own will . The supernatural truths of faith having_been assailed and cast out as though hostile to reason , the very Author and Redeemer of the human_race has_been slowly and little by little banished from the universities , the lyceums and gymnasia in a word , from every public institution . In fine , the rewards and punishments of a future and eternal_life having_been handed over to oblivion , the ardent desire of happiness has_been limited to the bounds of the present . Such doctrines as these having_been scattered far and wide , so great a license of thought and action having sprung up on all sides , it -isaia- no matter for surprise that_men of the lowest class , weary of their wretched home or workshop , are eager to attack the homes and fortunes of the rich ; it -isaia- no matter for surprise that already there exists no sense of security either in public or private life , and that the human_race should_have advanced to the very verge of final dissolution . But the supreme pastors of the Church , on whom_the duty falls of guarding the Lord s flock from the snares of the enemy , have striven in time to ward off the danger and provide_for the safety of the faithful . For , as soon as the secret societies began to be formed , in whose bosom the seeds of the errors which_we_have already mentioned were even then being nourished , the Roman Pontiffs Clement XII and Benedict XIV did not_fail to unmask the evil counsels of the sects , and to warn the faithful of the whole globe against the ruin which_would be wrought . Later on again , when a licentious sort of liberty was attributed to man by a set of men_who gloried in the name of philosophers , and a new right , as they call it , against the natural and divine_law began to be framed and sanctioned , Pope Pius VI , of happy_memory , -atti_degli_apostoli- once exposed in public documents the guile and falsehood of their doctrines , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time foretold with apostolic foresight the ruin into which_the people so miserably deceived would be dragged . But , as no adequate precaution was taken to prevent their evil teachings from leading the people more_and_more astray , and lest they_should be allowed to escape in the public statutes of States , Popes Pius VII and Leo XII condemned by anathema the secret sects , and again warned society of the danger which threatened them . Finally , all have witnessed with what solemn words and great firmness and constancy of soul our glorious predecessor , Pius IX , of happy_memory , both in his allocutions and in his encyclical letters addressed to the bishops of all the world , fought now against the wicked attempts of the sects , now openly by name against the pest of socialism , which_was already making headway . But it -isaia- to be lamented that those_to_whom has_been committed the guardianship of the public weal , deceived by the wiles of wicked men and terrified by their threats , have looked upon the Church with a suspicious and even hostile eye , not perceiving that the attempts of the sects would be vain if the doctrine of the Catholic Church and the authority of the Roman Pontiffs had always survived , with the honor that belongs to them , among princes and peoples . For , '' the church of the living God , which_-isaia- the pillar and ground of truth , '' hands down those doctrines and precepts whose special object -isaia- the safety and peace of society and the uprooting of the evil growth of socialism . For , indeed , although the socialists , stealing the very Gospel itself with_a_view to deceive more_easily the unwary , have_been accustomed to distort it so as to suit their_own purposes , nevertheless so great -isaia- the difference between their depraved teachings and the most pure doctrine of Christ that none greater could exist : '' for_what participation hath justice with injustice or what fellowship hath light with darkness ? '' Their habit , as we have intimated , -isaia- always to maintain that nature has made all men equal , and that , therefore , neither honor nor respect -isaia- due to majesty , nor obedience to laws , unless , perhaps , to those sanctioned by their_own good pleasure . But , on the contrary , in accordance_with_the teachings of the Gospel , the equality of men consists in this : that all , having inherited the same nature , are_called to the same most_high dignity of the sons of God , and that , as one_and_the_same end -isaia- set before all , each one_-isaia- to be judged by the same law and will receive punishment or reward according_to_his deserts . The inequality of rights and of power proceeds from the very Author of nature , '' from whom all paternity in heaven and earth -isaia- named . '' But the minds of princes and their subjects are , according to Catholic doctrine and precepts , bound up one_with the other in such a manner , by mutual duties and rights , that the thirst_for power -isaia- restrained and the rational ground of obedience made easy , firm , and noble . Assuredly , the Church wisely inculcates the apostolic precept on the mass of men : '' There -isaia- no power but_from God ; and those_that are , are ordained of God . Therefore he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God . And they that resist purchase to themselves damnation . '' And again she admonishes those '' subject by necessity '' to be so '' not_only_for wrath but_also_for conscience sake , '' and to render '' to all men their dues ; tribute to whom tribute -isaia- due , custom to whom custom , fear to whom fear , honor to whom honor . '' For , He who created and governs all things has , in His wise providence , appointed that the things_which are lowest should attain their ends by those_which are intermediate , and these again by the highest . Thus , as even in the kingdom_of_heaven He hath willed that the choirs of angels be distinct and some subject to others , and also in the Church has instituted various orders and a diversity of offices , so that all are_not apostles or doctors or pastors , so also_has He appointed that there_should be various orders in civil_society , differing in dignity , rights , and power , whereby_the State , like the Church , should be one_body , consisting of many members , some nobler than others , but all necessary to each_other and solicitous for the common_good . But that rulers may use the power conceded to them to save and not to destroy , the Church of Christ seasonably warns even princes that the sentence of the Supreme Judge overhangs them , and , adopting the words of divine wisdom , calls upon all in the name of God : '' Give ear , you that rule_the people , and that please yourselves in multitudes of nations ; for power -isaia- given you by the Lord , and strength by the Most High , who_will examine your works , and search out your thoughts . For a most severe judgment shall be for them that bear rule . For God will_not except any man s person , neither will he stand in awe of any man s greatness , for he hath made the little and the great ; and he hath equally care of all . But a greater punishment -isaia- ready for the more mighty . '' And if -atti_degli_apostoli- any time it happen that the power of the State -isaia- rashly and tyrannically wielded by princes , the teaching of the Catholic church_does not_allow an insurrection on private authority against them , lest public order be only the more disturbed , and lest society take greater hurt therefrom . And when affairs come to such a pass that_there_-isaia- no other hope of safety , she teaches_that relief may be hastened by the merits of Christian patience and by earnest prayers to God . But , if the will of legislators and princes shall_have sanctioned or commanded anything repugnant to the divine or natural_law , the dignity and duty of the Christian name , as well as the judgment of the Apostle , urge that '' God -isaia- to be obeyed rather_than man . Even family_life itself , which_-isaia- the cornerstone of all society and government , necessarily feels and experiences the salutary power of the Church , which redounds to the right ordering and preservation of every State and kingdom . For you_know , venerable_brethren_,_that the foundation of this society rests first of all in the indissoluble union of man and wife according to the necessity of natural_law , and -isaia- completed in the mutual rights_and_duties of parents and children , masters and servants . You know also_that the doctrines of socialism strive almost completely to dissolve this union ; since , that stability which_-isaia- imparted to it by religious wedlock being lost , it follows_that the power of the father over his_own children , and the duties of the children toward their_parents , must be greatly weakened . But the Church , on the contrary , teaches_that '' marriage , honorable in all , '' which God himself instituted in the very_beginning of the world , and made indissoluble for the propagation and preservation of the human species , has become still_more binding and more holy through Christ , who raised it to the dignity of a sacrament , and chose to use it as the figure of His own union with the Church . Wherefore , as the Apostle has it , as Christ -isaia- the head of the Church , so -isaia- the man the head of the woman ; and as the Church -isaia- subject to Christ , who embraces her with a most chaste and undying love , so also should wives be subject to their husbands , and be loved by them in turn with a faithful and constant affection . In like_manner does the Church temper the use of parental and domestic authority , that_it_may tend to hold children and servants to their_duty , without going beyond bounds . For , according to Catholic teaching , the authority of our heavenly Father and Lord -isaia- imparted to parents and masters , whose authority , therefore , not_only takes its origin and force from Him , but_also borrows its_nature and character . Hence , the Apostle exhorts children to '' obey their_parents in the Lord , and honor their father and mother , which -isaia-_the_first commandment with promise '' ; and he admonishes parents : '' And you , fathers , provoke not your children to anger , but bring them up in the discipline and correction of the Lord . '' Again , the apostle enjoins the divine precept on servants and masters , exhorting the former to be '' obedient to their lords according to the flesh of Christ . with a good_will serving , as to the Lord '' ; and the latter , to '' forbear threatenings , knowing that the Lord of all -isaia- in heaven , and there_-isaia- no respect of persons with God . '' If only all these_matters were faithfully observed according to the divine will by all on whom_they are enjoined , most assuredly every family would be a figure of the heavenly home , and the wonderful blessings there begotten would_not confine themselves to the households alone , but would scatter their riches abroad through the nations . But Catholic wisdom , sustained by the precepts of natural and divine_law , provides with especial care_for public_and_private tranquility in its doctrines and teachings regarding the duty of government and the distribution of the goods which_are necessary_for life and use . For , while the socialists would destroy the '' right '' of property , alleging it to be a human invention altogether opposed to the inborn equality of man , and , claiming a community of goods , argue that poverty should_not be peaceably endured , and that the property and privileges of the rich may be rightly invaded , the Church , with much greater wisdom and good sense , recognizes the inequality among_men , who_are born with different powers of body and mind , inequality in actual possession , also , and holds that the right of property and of ownership , which springs from nature itself , must_not be touched and stands inviolate . For she knows that stealing and robbery were forbidden in so special a manner by God , the Author and Defender of right , that He would not_allow man even to desire what belonged to another , and that thieves and despoilers , no less_than adulterers and idolaters , are shut out from the Kingdom of Heaven . But not the less on this account does our holy Mother not neglect the care of the poor or omit to provide_for their necessities ; but , rather , drawing them to her with a mother s embrace , and knowing that_they bear the person of Christ Himself , who regards the smallest gift to the poor as a benefit conferred on Himself , holds them in great honor . She does all she_can to help_them ; she provides homes and hospitals where_they may be received , nourished , and cared for all the world over and watches over these . She -isaia- constantly pressing on the rich that_most grave precept to give what remains to the poor ; and she holds over their heads the divine sentence that unless they succor the needy they_will be repaid by eternal torments . In fine , she_does all she_can to relieve and comfort the poor , either by holding up to them the example of Christ , '' who being rich became poor for our sake , or by reminding them of his_own words , wherein he pronounced the poor blessed and bade them hope_for the reward of eternal bliss . But who_does_not see that_this_-isaia- the best method of arranging the old struggle between_the rich and poor ? For , as the very evidence of facts and events shows , if this method -isaia- rejected or disregarded , one of two things must occur : either the greater portion of the human_race will fall back into the vile condition of slavery which so long prevailed among the pagan nations , or human_society must continue to be disturbed by constant eruptions , to be disgraced by rapine and strife , as we have_had sad witness even in recent_times . These things being so , then , venerable_brethren , as -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Our pontificate We , on whom_the guidance of the whole Church now lies , pointed_out a place of refuge to the peoples and the princes tossed about by the fury of the tempest , so now , moved by the extreme peril that_-isaia- on them , We again lift up Our voice , and beseech them again_and_again for their_own safety s sake as well as that of their_people to welcome and give ear to the Church which_has had such wonderful influence on the public prosperity of kingdoms , and to recognize_that political and religious affairs are so closely united that what_-isaia- taken from the spiritual weakens the loyalty of subjects and the majesty of the government . And since_they know_that the Church of Christ has such power to ward off the plague of socialism as cannot be found in human laws , in the mandates of magistrates , or in the force of armies , let_them restore that Church to the condition and liberty in which_she may exert her healing force for the benefit of all society . But you_,_venerable_brethren , who know_the origin and the drift of these gathering evils , strive with all your force of soul to implant the Catholic teaching deep in the minds of all . Strive that all may have_the habit of clinging to God with filial love and revering His divinity from their tenderest years ; that_they_may respect the majesty of princes and of laws ; that_they_may restrain their passions and stand fast by the order which God has established in civil and domestic society . Moreover , labor hard that the children of the Catholic Church neither join nor favor in any_way whatsoever this abominable sect ; let_them show , on the contrary , by noble deeds and right dealing in all things , how well and happily human_society would hold together were each member to shine as an example of right doing and of virtue . In fine , as the recruits of socialism are especially sought among artisans and workmen , who , tired , perhaps , of labor , are more_easily allured by the hope of riches and the promise of wealth , it -isaia- well to encourage societies of artisans and workmen which , constituted under the guardianship of religion , may tend to make all associates contented with_their lot and move them to a quiet and peaceful life . Venerable brethren , may He who_-isaia- the beginning and end of every good work inspire your and Our endeavors . And , indeed , the very thought of these_days , in which_the anniversary of our Lord s birth -isaia- solemnly observed , moves us to hope_for speedy help . For the new life_which Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- His birth brought to a world already aging and steeped in the very depths of wickedness He bids us also to hope_for , and the peace which He then announced by the angels to men He has promised to us also . For the Lord s '' hand -isaia- not shortened that he cannot save , neither -isaia-_his ear heavy that he cannot hear . '' In these most auspicious days , then , venerable_brethren , wishing all joy and happiness to you and to the faithful of your churches , We earnestly pray the Giver of all good that again '' there_may appear unto men the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour , '' who brought us out of the power of our most deadly enemy into the most noble dignity of the sons of God . And that We may the sooner and more_fully gain our wish , do you_,_venerable_brethren , join with Us in lifting up your fervent prayers to God and beg the intercession of the Blessed and Immaculate Virgin Mary , and of Joseph her spouse , and of the blessed Apostles Peter and Paul , in whose prayers We have_the greatest confidence . And in the meanwhile We impart to you , with the inmost affection of the heart , and to your_clergy and faithful people , the apostolic_benediction as an augury of the divine gifts . Peter s , in Rome , on the twenty eighth day of December , , in the first year of Our pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : . On Freemasonry , Humanum genus .
