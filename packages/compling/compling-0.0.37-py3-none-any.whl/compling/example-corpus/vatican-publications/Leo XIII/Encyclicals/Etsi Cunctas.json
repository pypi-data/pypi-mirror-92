Although all and every_part of the Lord s flock entrusted to our care we embracewith deep affection and love , nevertheless , our concern and thoughts go outabove all to those we see suffering misfortune . Truly , we experience the naturalfeeling of parents who_suffer greater anxiety for and are_more protective ofthose of their_children who_have_been struck by adversity . We , accordingly , havealways been moved with exceptional sympathy and the most kindly considerationfor the Catholics of Ireland so violently and constantly tried by long andlasting hardships . Their remarkable steadfastness in patient endurance hasalways aroused our deepest esteem , for no tribulation has_ever been_able todestroy or diminish the faith that_-isaia- the gift of their fathers . We have admonished them repeatedly and finally sent our decree because we saw that_our advice and our decree were consonant with truth and justice , on the one_hand , and would benefit your affairs , on the other . We could never intend to harm in any_way the cause of Ireland with interference that rightfully could be censured . Indeed , as a testimony of our good_will towards_the Irish , we are sending yougifts of vestments , vessels and ornaments that_are a partof sacred furnishings . These we assign to the Cathedral Churches of Ireland to enhance the beauty of the House of God and divine_worship . Other gifts , less precious , that we purified with_our blessing , are for the sake of personal piety and are to be given to private persons whom we shall clearly and carefully designate . We are in no doubt that_it_-isaia- more_and_more evident_that our fatherly lovefor the Irish has_never changed . They , to be sure , will_become more deserving ofthis love if they continue obedient to and trusting in us , heedfully guardingagainst the treacherous who do not_hesitate to distort our counsel by falseinterpretation and , if it were possible , destroy their glorious allegiance tothe Catholic Church , which_they_have received as their greatest and most nobleheritage . We pray for_every best gift of heavenly grace for you_,_venerable brother , clergy and the faithful whom_you serve and the whole of Ireland , and lovingly impart our Apostolic Blessing . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , December , , in the eleventh year of Ourpontificate .
