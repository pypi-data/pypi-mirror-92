The long continued and most bitter war waged against the divine authority of the Church has reached the culmination to which it was tending , the common danger , namely , of human_society , and especially of the civil_power on which_the public safety chiefly reposes . In our_own times most particularly this result -isaia- apparent . For popular passions now reject , with more boldness than formerly , every restraint of authority . So great -isaia- the license on all sides , so frequent are seditious and tumults , that not_only -isaia- obedience often refused to those_who rule states , but a sufficiently safe guarantee of security does_not seem to have_been left to them . For a long time , indeed , pains have_been taken to render rulers the object of contempt and hatred to the multitude . The flames of envy thus excited have -atti_degli_apostoli- last burst forth , and attempts have_been several times made , -atti_degli_apostoli- very short intervals , on the life of sovereign princes , either by secret plots or by open attacks . The whole of Europe was lately filled_with horror -atti_degli_apostoli- the horrible murder of a most powerful emperor . Whilst the minds_of_men are_still filled_with astonishment -atti_degli_apostoli- the magnitude of the crime , abandoned men do not fear publicly to utter threats and intimidations against other European princes . These perils to commonwealth , which_are before Our eyes , fill Us with grave anxiety , when We behold the security of rulers and the tranquility of empires , together_with_the safety of nations , put in peril almost from hour to hour . Nevertheless , the divine power of the Christian religion has_given birth to excellent principles of stability and order for the State , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it has penetrated into the customs and institutions of States . And of this_power not the least nor last fruit -isaia- a just and wise proportion of mutual rights_and_duties in both princes and peoples . For in the precepts and example of Christ our Lord there_-isaia- a wonderful force for restraining in their_duty as much those_who obey as those_who rule ; and for keeping between_them that agreement which_-isaia- most according to nature , and that concord of wills , so to speak , from which arises a course of administration tranquil and free_from all disturbance . Wherefore , being , by the favor of God , entrusted with the government of the Catholic Church , and made guardian and interpreter of the doctrines of Christ , We judge that it belongs to Our jurisdiction , venerable_brethren , publicly to set_forth what Catholic truth demands of every_one in this sphere of duty ; thus making clear also by what way and by what means measures may be taken for the public safety in so critical a state of affairs . Although man , when excited by a certain arrogance and contumacy , has often striven to cast aside the reins of authority , he has_never yet been_able to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the state of obeying no one . In every association and community of men , necessity itself compels that_some should hold pre eminence , lest society , deprived of a prince or head by which_it_-isaia- ruled should come to dissolution and be prevented from attaining the end for_which it was created and instituted . But , if it was not_possible that political power should be removed from the midst of states , it -isaia- certain_that men_have used every art to take away its influence and to lessen its majesty , as was especially_the case in the sixteenth century , when a fatal novelty of opinions infatuated many . Since that epoch , not_only has the multitude striven after a liberty greater_than -isaia- just , but it has seen fit to fashion the origin and construction of the civil_society of men in accordance_with its_own will . Indeed , very many men of more recent_times , walking in the footsteps of those_who in a former age assumed to themselves the name of philosophers , say that all power comes_from_the people ; so that_those_who exercise it in the State do so not as their_own , but as delegated to them by the people , and that , by this rule , it can be revoked by the will of the very people by whom it was delegated . But from_these , Catholics dissent , who affirm that the right to rule -isaia- from God , as from a natural and necessary principle . It -isaia- of importance , however , to remark in this place that_those_who may be placed over the State may in certain cases be chosen by the will and decision of the multitude , without opposition to or impugning of the Catholic doctrine . And by this choice , in truth , the ruler -isaia- designated , but the rights of ruling are_not thereby conferred . Nor -isaia- the authority delegated to him , but the person by whom it -isaia- to be exercised -isaia- determined upon . There -isaia- no question here respecting forms of government , for there_-isaia- no reason_why the Church should_not approve of the chief power being held by one man or by more , provided only it be just , and that it tend to the common advantage . Wherefore , so long as justice be respected , the people_are not hindered from choosing for themselves that form of government which suits best either their_own disposition , or the institutions and customs of their ancestors . But , as regards political power , the Church rightly teaches_that it comes_from God , for it finds this clearly testified in the sacred Scriptures and in the monuments of antiquity ; besides , no other doctrine can be conceived which_-isaia- more agreeable to reason , or more in accord with the safety of both princes and peoples . In truth , that the source of human power -isaia- in God the books of the Old Testament in very many places clearly establish . by me princes rule , and the mighty decree justice . '' And in another place : '' Give ear you that rule_the people . for power -isaia- given you of the Lord and strength by the Most High . '' The same thing -isaia- contained in the Book of Ecclesiasticus : '' Over every nation he bath set a ruler . '' These things , however , which_they had learned of God , men were little by little untaught through heathen superstition , which even as it has corrupted the true aspect and often the very concept of things , so also it has corrupted the natural form and beauty of the chief power . Afterwards , when_the Christian Gospel shed its light , vanity yielded to truth , and that noble and divine principle whence all authority flows began to shine_forth . To the Roman governor , ostentatiously pretending that he had the power of releasing and of condemning , our Lord Jesus Christ answered : '' Thou shouldst not_have any power against me unless it were given thee from above . Augustine , in explaining this passage , says : '' Let us learn what He said , which also He taught by His Apostle , that_there_-isaia- no power but_from God . '' The faithful voice of the Apostles , as an echo , repeats the doctrine and precepts of Jesus Christ . The teaching of Paul to the Romans , when subject to the authority of heathen princes , -isaia- lofty and full of gravity : '' There -isaia- not power but_from God , '' from which , as from its cause , he draws this conclusion : '' The prince -isaia- the minister of God . The Fathers of the Church have_taken great care to proclaim and propagate this_very doctrine in which_they had_been instructed . '' We do not attribute , '' says St . Augustine , '' the power of giving government and empires to any but the true God . '' On the same passage St . John Chrysostom says : '' That there_are kingdoms , and that_some rule , while others are subject , and that none of these_things -isaia- brought_about by accident or rashly . -isaia- , I say , a work of divine wisdom . '' The same truth_-isaia- testified by St . Gregory the Great , saying : '' We confess that power -isaia- given from above to emperors and kings . '' Verily the holy doctors have undertaken to illustrate also the same precepts by the natural light of reason in such_a_way_that they_must appear to be altogether right and true , even to those_who follow reason_for their sole guide . And , indeed , nature , or rather God who_-isaia- the Author of nature , wills that_man should live in a civil_society ; and this_-isaia- clearly shown both by the faculty of language , the greatest medium of intercourse , and by numerous innate desires of the mind , and the many necessary things , and things of great_importance , which men isolated cannot procure , but which_they can procure when joined and associated_with others . But now , a society can neither exist nor be conceived in which there_-isaia- no one to govern_the wills of individuals , in such_a_way as to make , as it were , one will out of many , and to impel them rightly and orderly to the common_good ; therefore , God has willed that in a civil_society there_should be some to rule_the multitude . And this also -isaia- a powerful argument , that_those by whose authority the State -isaia- administered must be able so to compel the citizens to obedience that_it_-isaia- clearly a sin in the latter not to obey . But no man_has in himself or of himself_the power of constraining the free will of others by fetters of authority of this_kind . This power resides solely in God , the Creator and Legislator of all things ; and it -isaia- necessary_that those_who exercise it should do it as having received it from God . '' There -isaia- one lawgiver and judge , who_-isaia- able to destroy and deliver . '' And this_-isaia- clearly seen in every_kind of power . That that_which resides in priests comes_from God -isaia- so acknowledged that among all nations they_are recognized as , and called , the ministers of God . In like_manner , the authority of fathers of families preserves a certain impressed image and form of the authority which_-isaia- in God , '' of whom all paternity in heaven and earth -isaia- named . '' But in this_way different kinds of authority have between_them wonderful resemblances , since , whatever there_-isaia- of government and authority , its origin -isaia- derived_from one_and_the_same Creator and Lord of the world , who_-isaia- God . Those who_believe civil_society to have risen from the free consent of men , looking for the origin of its authority from the same source , say that each_individual has_given up something of his right , and that voluntarily every_person has put himself into the power of the one man in whose person the whole of those rights has_been centered . But it -isaia- a great error not to see , what_-isaia- manifest , that_men , as they_are_not a nomad race , have_been created , without their_own free will , for a natural community of life . It -isaia- plain , moreover , that the pact which_they allege -isaia- openly a falsehood and a fiction , and that it has no authority to confer on political power such_great force , dignity , and firmness as the safety of the State and the common_good of the citizens require . Then only will the government have all those ornaments and guarantees , when_it_-isaia- understood to emanate from God as its august and most_sacred source . And it -isaia- impossible that any should be found not_only more true but even_more advantageous than_this opinion . For the authority of the rulers of a State , if it be a certain communication of divine power , will by that_very reason immediately acquire a dignity greater_than human not , indeed , that impious and most absurd dignity sometimes desired by heathen emperors when affecting divine honors , but a true and solid one received by a certain divine gift and benefaction . Whence it will behoove citizens to submit themselves and to be obedient to rulers , as to God , not_so_much through fear of punishment as through respect_for their majesty ; nor for the sake of pleasing , but through conscience , as doing their_duty . And by this_means authority will remain far more firmly seated in its place . For the citizens , perceiving the force of this_duty , would necessarily avoid dishonesty and contumacy , because_they must be persuaded that_they who resist State authority resist the divine will ; that_they who refuse honor to rulers refuse it to God Himself . This doctrine the Apostle Paul particularly inculcated on the Romans ; to whom he wrote with so great authority and weight on the reverence to be entertained toward_the higher powers , that it seems nothing could be prescribed more weightily : '' Let every soul be subject to higher powers , for there_-isaia- no power but_from God , and those_that are , are ordained of God . Therefore he that resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God , and they that resist purchase to themselves damnation . wherefore be subject of necessity , not_only_for wrath , but_also_for conscience sake . '' And in agreement with this_-isaia- the celebrated declaration of Peter , the Prince of the Apostles , on the same subject : '' Be ye subject , therefore , to every_human creature for God s sake ; whether it be to the king as excelling , or to governors , as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers , and for the praise of the good , for so -isaia- the will of God . The one only reason which men_have for not obeying -isaia- when anything -isaia- demanded of them which_-isaia- openly repugnant to the natural or the divine_law , for it -isaia- equally unlawful to command to do anything in which_the law of nature or the will of God -isaia- violated . If , therefore , it should happen to any_one to be compelled to prefer one or the other , viz . , to disregard either the commands of God or those of rulers , he must obey Jesus Christ , who commands us to '' give to Caesar the things_that_are Caesar s , and to God the things_that_are God s , '' and must reply courageously after_the example of the Apostles : '' We ought to obey God rather_than men . '' And yet there_-isaia- no reason_why those_who so behave themselves should be accused of refusing obedience ; for , if the will of rulers -isaia- opposed to the will and the laws of God , they_themselves exceed the bounds of their_own power and pervert justice ; nor_can their authority then be valid , which , when there_-isaia- no justice , -isaia- null . But in order_that justice may be retained in government it -isaia- of the highest importance that_those_who rule States should understand_that political power was_not created for the advantage of any private individual ; and that the administration of the State must be carried on to the profit of those_who_have been committed to their care , not to the profit of those_to_whom it has_been committed . Let princes take example from the Most High God , by whom authority_-isaia- given to them ; and , placing before themselves His model in governing the State , let_them rule over the people_with equity and faithfulness , and let_them add to that severity , which_-isaia- necessary , a paternal charity . On this account they_are warned in the oracles of the sacred Scriptures , that_they_will have themselves some day to render an account to the King of kings and Lord of lords ; if they_shall fail in their_duty , that it will_not be possible_for them in any_way to escape the severity of God : '' The Most High will examine your work and search out your thoughts : because being ministers of his_kingdom you have_not judged rightly . Horribly and speedily will he appear to you , for a most severe judgement shall be for them that bear rule . For God will_not accept any man s person , neither will he stand in awe of any man s greatness ; for he made the little and the great , and he hath equally care of all . But a greater punishment -isaia- ready for the more mighty . And if these precepts protect the State , all cause or desire_for seditions -isaia- removed ; the honor and security of rulers , the quiet and wellbeing of societies will be secure . The dignity also of the citizen -isaia- best provided for ; for to them it has_been permitted to retain even in obedience that greatness which conduces to the excellence of man . For they understand_that , in the judgment of God , there_-isaia- neither slave nor free man ; that_there_-isaia- one Lord of all , rich '' to all that call_upon Him , '' but that_they on this account submit to and obey their rulers , because these in a certain sort bring before them the image of God , '' whom to serve -isaia- to reign . But the Church has_always so acted that the Christian form of civil government may_not dwell in the minds_of_men , but that_it_may be exhibited also in the life and habits of nations . As long as there_were -atti_degli_apostoli- the helm of the States pagan emperors , who_were prevented by superstition from rising to that form of imperial government which We have sketched , she studied how to instill into the minds of subjects , immediately on their embracing the Christian institutions , the teaching that_they must be desirous of bringing their_lives into conformity_with them . Therefore , the pastors of souls , after_the example of the Apostle Paul , were accustomed to teach the people_with the utmost care and diligence '' to be subject to princes and powers , to obey -atti_degli_apostoli- a word , '' and to pray God for all men and particularly '' for kings and all that_are in a high station : for this_-isaia- good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour . '' And the Christians of old left the most striking proofs of this ; for , when they_were harassed in a very unjust and cruel way by pagan emperors , they nevertheless -atti_degli_apostoli- no time omitted to conduct themselves obediently and submissively , so that , in fact , they seemed to vie with each_other : those in cruelty , and these in obedience . This great modesty , this fixed determination to obey , was so well_known that it could_not be obscured by the calumny and malice of enemies . On this account , those_who were going to plead in public before the emperors for_any persons bearing the Christian name proved by this argument especially that_it_was unjust to enact laws against the Christians because_they were in the sight of all men exemplary in their bearing according to the laws . Athenagoras thus confidently addresses Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and Lucius Aurelius Commodus , his_son : '' You allow us , who commit no evil , yea , who demean ourselves the most piously and justly of all toward God and likewise toward your government , to be driven about , plundered and exiled . '' In like_manner , Tertullian openly praises the Christians because_they were_the best and surest friends of all to the Empire : '' The Christian -isaia- the enemy of no one , much less of the emperor , whom he knows to be appointed by God , and whom he must , therefore , of necessity love , reverence and honor , and wish to be preserved together_with_the whole Roman Empire . '' Nor did he hesitate to affirm that , within_the limits of the Empire , the number of enemies was wont to diminish just in proportion as the number of Christians increased . There -isaia-_also a remarkable testimony to the same point in the Epistle to Diognetus , which confirms the statement that the Christians -atti_degli_apostoli- that period were not_only in the habit of obeying the laws , but in every office they of their_own accord did more , and more perfectly , than they_were required to do by the laws . '' Christians observe these_things which_have obtained the sanction of the law , and in the character of their_lives they even go beyond_the law . The case , indeed , was different when they_were ordered by the edicts of emperors and the threats of praetors to abandon the Christian faith or in any_way fail in their_duty . At these times , undoubtedly , they preferred to displease men rather_than God . Yet , even under these circumstances , they_were so far from doing anything seditious or despising the imperial majesty that_they took it on themselves only to profess themselves Christians , and declare that they_would not in any_way alter their_faith . But they_had no thought of resistance , calmly and joyfully they went to the torture of the rack , in so much that the magnitude of the torments gave place to their magnitude of mind . During the same period the force of Christian principles was observed in like_manner in the army . For it was a mark of a Christian soldier to combine the greatest fortitude with the greatest attention to military discipline , and to add to nobility of mind immovable fidelity towards his prince . But , if anything dishonorable was required of him , as , for instance , to break the laws of God , or to turn his sword against innocent disciples of Christ , then , indeed , he refused to execute the orders , yet in such wise that he would rather retire from the army and die for his religion than oppose the public_authority by means of sedition and tumult . But afterward , when Christian rulers were -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of States , the Church insisted much_more on testifying and preaching how_much sanctity was inherent in the authority of rulers . Hence , when people thought of princedom , the image of a certain sacred majesty would present itself to their_minds , by which they_would be impelled to greater reverence and love of rulers . And on this account she wisely provides that kings should commence their reign with the celebration of solemn rites ; which , in the Old Testament , was appointed by divine authority . But from the time_when the civil_society of men , raised from the ruins of the Roman Empire , gave hope of its future Christian greatness , the Roman Pontiffs , by the institution of the Holy Empire , consecrated the political power in a wonderful manner . Greatly , indeed , was_the authority of rulers ennobled ; and it -isaia- not to be doubted that_what was then instituted would always have_been a very great gain , both to ecclesiastical and civil_society , if princes and peoples had ever looked to the same object as the Church . And , indeed , tranquility and a sufficient prosperity lasted so long as there_was a friendly agreement between these_two powers . If the people were turbulent , the Church was -atti_degli_apostoli- once the mediator for peace . Recalling all to their_duty , she subdued the more lawless passions partly by kindness and partly by authority . So , if , in ruling , princes erred in their government , she went to them and , putting before them the rights , needs , and lawful wants of their_people , urged them to equity , mercy , and kindness . Whence it was often brought_about that the dangers of civil wars and popular tumults were stayed . On the other_hand , the doctrines on political power invented by late writers have_already produced great ills amongst men , and it -isaia- to be feared that_they_will cause the very greatest disasters to posterity . For an unwillingness to attribute the right of ruling to God , as its Author , -isaia- not less_than a willingness to blot out the greatest splendor of political power and to destroy its force . And they_who say that this_power depends on the will of the people err in opinion first of all ; then they place authority on too weak and unstable a foundation . For the popular passions , incited and goaded on by these opinions , will break out more insolently ; and , with_great harm to the common weal , descend headlong by an easy and smooth road to revolts and to open sedition . In truth , sudden uprisings and the boldest rebellions immediately followed in Germany the so called Reformation , the authors and leaders of which , by their new doctrines , attacked -atti_degli_apostoli- the very foundation religious and civil authority ; and this with so fearful an outburst of civil war and with_such slaughter that_there was scarcely any place free_from tumult and bloodshed . From this heresy there arose in the last century a false philosophy a new right as it -isaia- called , and a popular authority , together_with an unbridled license which many regard as the only true liberty . Hence we have reached the limit of horrors , to wit , communism , socialism , nihilism , hideous deformities of the civil_society of men and almost its ruin . And yet too many attempt to enlarge the scope of these evils , and under the pretext of helping the multitude , already have fanned no small flames of misery . The things we thus mention are neither unknown nor very remote from us . This , indeed , -isaia- all the graver because rulers , in the midst of such threatening dangers , have no remedies sufficient to restore discipline and tranquility . They supply themselves_with the power of laws , and think to coerce , by the severity of their punishment , those_who disturb their governments . They are right to a certain extent , but yet should seriously consider that no power of punishment can be so great that it alone_can preserve the State . Thomas admirably teaches , '' -isaia- a weak foundation ; for those_who_are subdued by fear would , should an occasion arise in which they_might hope_for immunity , rise more eagerly against their rulers , in proportion to the previous extent of their restraint through fear . '' And besides , '' from too great fear many fall_into despair ; and despair drives men to attempt boldly to gain what_they desire . '' That these_things are so we see from experience . It -isaia- therefore necessary to seek a higher and more reliable reason_for obedience , and to say explicitly that legal severity cannot be efficacious unless men_are led on by duty , and moved by the salutary fear of God . But this_-isaia-_what religion can best ask of them , religion which by its power enters into the souls and bends the very wills of men causing them not_only to render obedience to their rulers , but_also to show their affection and good_will , which_-isaia- in every society of men the best guardian of safety . For this_reason_the Roman Pontiffs are to be regarded as having greatly served the public good , for they_have ever endeavored to break the turbulent and restless spirit of innovators , and have often warned men of the danger they_are to civil_society . In this respect we may worthily recall to mind the declaration of Clement VII to Ferdinand , King of Bohemia and Hungary : '' In the cause of faith your_own dignity and advantage and that of other rulers -isaia- included , since_the faith cannot be shaken without your authority being brought down ; which_has_been most clearly shown in several instances . '' In the same_way the supreme forethought and courage of Our predecessors have_been shown , especially of Clement XI , Benedict XIV , and Leo XII , who , when in their day the evil of vicious doctrine was more widely spreading and the boldness of the sects was becoming greater , endeavored by their authority to close the door against them . And We Ourselves have several times declared what great dangers are impending , and have pointed_out the best ways of warding them off . To princes and other rulers of the State we have offered the protection of religion , and we have exhorted the people to make abundant use of the great benefits which_the Church supplies . Our present object -isaia- to make rulers understand_that this protection , which_-isaia- stronger than_any , -isaia- again offered to them ; and We earnestly exhort them in our Lord to defend religion , and to consult the interest of their Lord to defend religion , and to consult the interest of their States by giving that liberty to the Church which_cannot be taken away without injury and ruin to the commonwealth . The Church of Christ , indeed , cannot be an object of suspicion to rulers , nor of hatred to the people ; for it urges rulers to follow justice , and in nothing to decline from their_duty ; while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it strengthens and in many_ways supports their authority . All things_that_are of a civil nature the Church acknowledges and declares to be under the power and authority of the ruler ; and in things whereof for different reasons the decision belongs both to the sacred and to the civil_power , the Church wishes that there_should be harmony between_the two so that injurious contests may be avoided . As to what regards the people , the Church has_been established for the salvation of all men and has_ever loved them as a mother . For it -isaia- the Church which by the exercise of her charity has_given gentleness to the minds_of_men , kindness to their manners , and justice to their laws . Never opposed to honest liberty , the Church has_always detested a tyrant s rule . This custom which_the Church has_ever had of deserving well of mankind -isaia- notably expressed by St . Augustine when he says_that '' the Church teaches kings to study the welfare of their_people , and people to submit to their kings , showing what_-isaia- due to all : and that to all -isaia- due charity and to no one injustice . For these reasons , venerable_brethren , your work will be most useful and salutary if you employ with us every industry and effort which God has_given you in order to avert the dangers and evils of human_society . Strive with all possible care to make men understand and show forth in their_lives what_the Catholic Church teaches on government and the duty of obedience . Let the people be frequently urged by your authority and teaching to fly from the forbidden sects , to abhor all conspiracy , to have nothing to do with sedition , and let_them understand_that they_who for God s sake obey their rulers render a reasonable service and a generous obedience . And as it -isaia- God '' who_gives safety to kings , '' and grants to the people '' to rest in the beauty of peace and in the tabernacles of confidence and in wealthy repose , '' it -isaia- to Him that we must pray , beseeching Him to incline all minds to uprightness and truth , to calm angry passions , to restore the long wished for tranquility to the world . That we may pray with_greater hope , let us take as our intercessors and protectors of our welfare the Virgin Mary , the great Mother of God , the help of Christians , and protector of the human_race ; St . Joseph , her chaste spouse , in whose patronage the whole Church greatly trusts ; and the Princes of the Apostles , Peter and Paul , the guardians and protectors of the Christian name .
