Last year We received your letter joyfully announcing the addition of a new ecclesiastical province and the founding of four new bishoprics . This new indication of apostolic solicitude in your nation was certainly cause for rejoicing . For among the many causes of the decline of Catholicism among_you , -isaia- that the number of bishops -isaia- too small for the inordinate size of the region and the unequal distribution of its inhabitants . As a result the bishops could_not exercise the vigilance they desired over the clergy and the flocks entrusted to them . They were unable either to ward off the unsuitable or to promote the strength and dignity of the Catholic name . Therefore you proved your pastoral zeal when , gathered -atti_degli_apostoli- Sao Paolo , you petitioned the Roman Pontiff to enlarge the episcopal hierarchy . We gladly agreed to grant your request . Now there_-isaia- hope of a fruitful increase of the Christian estate , since you_have more bishops ; however , each_one of you_must apply opportune remedies to the spreading evils increasing everywhere . In this_regard , We wish to recommend some useful ideas to you for increasing faith and Christian piety . In the first_place , let men preparing for sacred orders be taught the best things , those for_which there_-isaia- the greatest need and which will_enable them to teach Catholic truths and to defend them strenuously against all assaults . All too_often daily experience makes it plain that where_the ministers lack appropriate doctrinal knowledge , their_people generally suffer from ignorance of the faith and religion . For it -isaia- from the mouth of the priest that_the_faithful ought to learn the law : He -isaia- the angel of the Lord . For this_reason we read the proclamation : the lips of the priest shall keep knowledge . The Apostle too mentions knowledge among_other reasons for proving himself your servant in Jesus . And where this knowledge -isaia- wanting , this evil also follows for the priests : they_are condemned by the people , with God also exacting a penalty for their neglect of duty . Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all people . But the embellishment of learning and its defense never leads to their goal if they_are separated_from sanctity of life and morals . Indeed , knowledge without love does_not build up but inflates . This -isaia- the usual practice of man . Though Christ taught that learning -isaia- to be accepted from the sacred ministers without regard_for any deeds of theirs which do not conform to the doctrine ; nevertheless men are_more influenced by what_they see than by what_they hear . For this_reason we read the clear testimony concerning God the Saviour , who_was not_only the teacher of shepherds but_also became their model , that he began to do and to teach . Hence the priest s actions must confirm the doctrine which he preaches and commends . Before all else he who_-isaia- appointed to rule a parish must_not be impatient with the labor . Called to the vineyard of the Lord , let_him diligently cultivate it , aware_that he must render a serious account sometime for the souls entrusted to him . Nor does he labor in vain if -atti_degli_apostoli- all times and in all matters he holds fast to learning . We must indeed fight strenuously for Christ , but_only -atti_degli_apostoli- the will and authorization of those_whom Christ has chosen as leaders . Seminaries and Teachers . To form such helpers for yourselves , Venerable Brothers , -isaia- your task . Indeed experience teaches_that future priests will be the kind you have_taken care to form . You have_the place , the sacred seminaries , where you can train ministers to your and the Church s desires as approved by God , workmen who_have no need to be ashamed . The very name seminary tells for_what great purpose they_have_been erected . Therefore encourage the growth and prosperity of the ecclesiastical seminaries which_you already have , both in the study of sacred learning and also in the training of souls . To ensure_that this training proceeds properly , the best teachers are needed ; they_must not_only be endowed_with sound learning , but_they must_also teach that doctrine agreeably and faithfully according to Our precepts . In order_that the young clergy become imbued_with the true spirit of the Church and that_they cultivate virtue , spiritual guides are to be chosen carefully . Moreover their work_-isaia- to be aided and perfected with all the solicitude of your labors . But in dioceses where_there are as yet no seminaries , let_the bishops use every_means to establish excellent ones as soon as possible . The Council of Trent has overseen this , and We have_also considered it in Our apostolic_letter of April , . The freedom of education which now prevails in your_country gives you greater facility to do what We have recommended with_regard to the arrangement of studies . For this_purpose you also have a great aid in the college for clerics which Pius IX labored to established for the convenience of South America and which We too have promoted and favored . Its outcome happily fulfills Our expectations . We joyfully recall that_many of you have_been graduated from this college . We encourage you to send young_men of special promise to Rome for their studies , and you_should use them appropriately afterwards as teachers or for any_other purpose . Religious Orders Subject to Authority of the Bishops . It -isaia- difficult to put into words the advantages for your sacred_ministry that the community of religious_orders will_bring you . By Our Apostolic providence We have determined to restore the original observance of their institutes from the losses of past times . To this_end , We decreed on September , , that native religious communities be subject to the authority of the bishops . In a matter so useful and important We trust that_your cooperation will_not be wanting . Pleasing results have_been obtained , transacted for this_purpose under the direction of Venerable Brother Jerome Gotti , Archbishop of Petra , Internuncio of the Apostolic See to your government . In order_that these beginnings may make greater progress and be brought to the desired end , We exhort you to labor diligently in this_matter for religion and especially_for your flocks . Meanwhile religious communities both of men and of women are to be congratulated for receiving Our commands with good_will and for showing themselves ready for the restitution of each_one s original institute . Needs of the Faithful . These matters concern the proper upbringing and application of the clergy to the sacred_ministry . But the needs of the faithful demand your efforts no less . In their regard , what_has precedence -isaia- that children and ignorant people_are properly to be taught the elements of our most_holy religion ; this calls for the unremitting diligence of the pastors . Then , where it -isaia- publicly permitted , instruction -isaia- to be organized for youth so that_they_will not be compelled to frequent the athletic facilities of heretics or attend schools where Catholic discipline -isaia- not mentioned unless to be calumniously derided , and this to the great detriment of faith and good morals . Besides , since minds are strengthened and stimulated by counsel and reciprocal example to do and suffer great things for religion , you will merit well on that account if you encourage and persuade laymen , especially_the young , to join Christian societies . We have frequently praised them in exhortations as institutions that strive to care_for the needs of religion and improve the advantages of the poor ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , they diminish the appeal of those associations that abuse the title of public charity , since_they are_very much opposed to the welfare of Church and State . Also do not_fail to realize how_much influence for good_and_evil , especially in these our_times , magazines and similar popular writings have acquired . Use these weapons in defense of the Christian name , with the leadership of the episcopate properly preserved and with all respect due the civil_power . Finally all Catholics should remember that_it_-isaia- of the greatest concern to the Church what kind of men_are elected to the legislature . Thus , preserving the rights of civil law , everyone must strive to elect those_who join zeal for religion to their zeal for public affairs . This will come about more readily if each_individual obeys the supreme_authority governing the state and if everyone continuously advocates those_things We have published not long ago in encyclical letters concerning the Christian constitution of the state . For the rest , may suitable love and concord of minds flourish among_you by thinking alike with one soul and one mind . For this_reason we strongly recommend that_you share your plans frequently among yourselves and hold episcopal synods in various places to satisfy the obligations of your sacred office . You have with you the Legate of the Apostolic See , who_will tell you Our mind and Our counsels . Then too , because of the paternal love with_which We embrace you , you_have Us -atti_degli_apostoli- all times ready to lend aid to your work . May God very graciously grant you the gifts of His heavenly blessings , which supply the strength needed to fill the pastoral_office in a holy and proper way . As a promise of these gifts , Venerable Brothers , We very lovingly impart the Apostolic Blessing to you , your_clergy , and the people who_have_been entrusted_to_your care . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , July , , in the seventeenth year of Our pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .
