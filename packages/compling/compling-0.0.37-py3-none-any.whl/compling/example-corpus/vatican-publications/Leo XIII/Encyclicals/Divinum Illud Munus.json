Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . That divine office which Jesus Christ received_from His Father for the welfare of mankind , and most perfectly fulfilled , had for its final object to put men in possession of the eternal_life of glory , and proximately during the course of ages to secure to them the life of divine_grace , which_-isaia- destined eventually to blossom into the life of heaven . Wherefore , our Saviour never ceases to invite , with infinite affection , all men , of every race and tongue , into the bosom of His Church : '' Come ye all to Me , '' '' I -amos- the Life , '' '' I -amos- the Good Shepherd . '' Nevertheless , according to His inscrutable counsels , He did_not will to entirely complete and finish this office Himself on earth , but as He had received it from the Father , so He transmitted it for its completion to the Holy Ghost . It -isaia- consoling to recall those assurances which Christ gave to the body of His disciples a little before He left the earth : '' It -isaia- expedient to you that I go : for if I go not , the Paraclete will_not come to you : but if I go , I will send Him to you '' John xvi . In these_words He gave as the chief reason of His departure and His return to the Father , the advantage which_would most certainly accrue to His followers from the coming of the Holy Ghost , and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , He made it clear_that the Holy Ghost -isaia- equally sent by and therefore proceeds from Himself and the Father ; that He would complete , in His office of Intercessor , Consoler , and Teacher , the work_which Christ Himself had begun in His mortal life . For , in the redemption of the world , the completion of the work was by Divine Providence reserved to the manifold power of that Spirit , who , in the creation , '' adorned the heavens '' Job xxvi . , , and '' filled the whole_world '' Wisdom i . The Two Principal Aims of Our Pontificate . Now We have earnestly striven , by the help of His grace , to follow theexample of Christ , Our Saviour , the Prince of Pastors , and the Bishop of ourSouls , by diligently carrying on His office , entrusted by Him to the Apostlesand chiefly to Peter , '' whose dignity faileth not , even in his unworthysuccessor '' St . Leo the Great , Sermon ii . , On the Anniversary of hisElection . In pursuance of this object We have endeavoured to direct all that Wehave attempted and persistently carried_out during a long pontificatetowards two chief ends : in the first_place , towards_the restoration , both in rulers and peoples , of the principles of the Christian life in civil and domestic society , since there_-isaia- no true life_for men except from Christ ; and , secondly , to promote the reunion of those_who_have fallen away from the Catholic Church either by heresy or by schism , since_it_-isaia- most undoubtedly the will of Christ that all should be united in one flock under one Shepherd . But now that We are looking forward to the approach of the closing days of Our life , Our soul -isaia- deeply moved to dedicate to the Holy Ghost , who_-isaia- the life_giving Love , all the work We have_done during Our pontificate , that He may bring it to maturity and fruitfulness . In order the better and more_fully to carry_out this Our intention , We have resolved to address you -atti_degli_apostoli- the approaching sacred season of Pentecost concerning the indwelling and miraculous power of the Holy Ghost ; and the extent and efficiency of His action , both in the whole_body of the Church and in the individual souls of its_members , through the glorious abundance of His divine graces . We earnestly desire_that , as a result , faith may be aroused in your minds concerning the mystery of the adorable Trinity , and especially that piety may increase and be inflamed towards_the Holy Ghost , to whom especially all of us owe the grace of following the paths of truth and virtue ; for , as St . Basil said , '' Who denieth that the dispensations concerning man , which_have_been made by the great God and our Saviour , Jesus Christ , according to the goodness of God , have_been fulfilled through the grace of the Spirit ? '' Of the Holy Ghost , c . The Catholic Doctrine of the Blessed Trinity . Before We enter upon this_subject , it will be both desirable and useful to say a few words about the Mystery of the Blessed Trinity . This dogma -isaia- called by the doctors of the Church '' the substance of the New Testament , '' that_-isaia- to say , the greatest of all mysteries , since_it_-isaia- the fountain and origin of them all . In order to know and contemplate this_mystery , the angels were created in Heaven and men upon earth . In order to teach more_fully this_mystery , which_was but foreshadowed in the Old Testament , God Himself came down from the angels unto men : '' No man bath seen God -atti_degli_apostoli- any time ; the only_begotten Son , who_-isaia- in the bosom of the Father , He bath declared Him '' John i . Whosoever then writes or speaks of the Trinity must keep before His eyes the prudent warning ofthe Angelic Doctor : '' When we speak of the Trinity , we must do so withcaution and modesty , for , as St . Augustine saith , nowhere else are moredangerous errors made , or -isaia- research more difficult , or discovery morefruitful '' Summ . The danger thatarises -isaia- lest the Divine Persons be confounded one_with the other in faith orworship , or lest the one Nature in them be separated : for '' This -isaia- theCatholic Faith , that_we_should adore one God in Trinity and Trinity inUnity . '' Therefore Our predecessor Innocent XII , absolutely refused thepetition of those_who desired a special festival in honour of God the Father . For , although the separate mysteries connected_with_the Incarnate Word arecelebrated on certain fixed days , yet there_-isaia- no special feast on which theWord -isaia- honoured according to His Divine Nature alone . And even the Feast ofPentecost was instituted in the earliest times , not_simply to honour the HolyGhost in Himself , but to commemorate His coming , or His external mission . Andall this has_been wisely ordained , lest from distinguishing the Persons menshould be led to distinguish the Divine Essence . Moreover the Church , in orderto preserve in her_children the purity of faith , instituted the Feast of theMost Holy Trinity , which John XXII . afterwards extended to the Universal Church . He also permitted altars and churches to be dedicated to the Blessed Trinity , and , with the divine approval , sanctioned the Order for the Ransom of Captives , which_-isaia- specially devoted to the Blessed Trinity and bears Its name . Many factsconfirm its truths . The worship paid to the saints and angels , to the Mother ofGod , and to Christ Himself , finally redounds to the honour of the BlessedTrinity . In prayers addressed to one Person , there_-isaia-_also mention of theothers ; in the litanies after_the individual Persons have_been separatelyinvoked , a common invocation of all -isaia- added : all psalms and hymns conclude withthe doxology to the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost ; blessings , sacred rites , andsacraments are either accompanied or concluded by the invocation of the BlessedTrinity . This was already foreshadowed by the Apostle in those words : '' Forof Him , and by Him , and in Him , are all things : to Him be glory for ever '' Rom . , , thereby signifying both the Trinity of Persons and the Unity ofNature : for as this_-isaia- one_and_the_same in each of the Persons , so to each -isaia- equally owing supreme glory , as to one_and_the_same God . Augustine commenting upon this testimony writes : '' The words of the Apostle , of Him , and by Him , and in Him are_not to be taken indiscriminately ; of Him refers to the Father , by Him to the Son , in Him to the Holy Ghost '' De Trin . The Church -isaia- accustomed most fittingly to attribute to the Father those works of the Divinity in which power excels , to the Son those in which wisdom excels , and those in which love excels to the Holy Ghost . Not that all perfections and external operations are_not common to the Divine Persons ; for '' the operations of the Trinity are indivisible , even as the essence of the Trinity -isaia- indivisible '' St . ; because as the three Divine Persons '' are inseparable , so do they act inseparably '' St . But by a certain comparison , and a kind of affinity between_the operations and the properties of the Persons , these operations are attributed or , as it -isaia- said , '' appropriated '' to One Person rather_than to the others . '' Just as we make_use of the traces of similarity or likeness which we find in creatures for the manifestation of the Divine Persons , so do we use Their essential attributes ; and this manifestation of the Persons by Their essential attributes -isaia- called appropriation '' St . In this manner the Father , who_-isaia- '' the principle of the whole God head '' St . -isaia-_also the efficient cause of all things , of the Incarnation of the Word , and the sanctification of souls ; '' of Him are all things '' : of Him , referring to the Father . But the Son , the Word , the Image of God -isaia-_also the exemplar cause , whence all creatures borrow their form and beauty , their order and harmony . He -isaia- for us the Way , the Truth , and the Life ; the Reconciles of man with God . '' By Him are all things '' : by Him , referring to the Son . The Holy Ghost -isaia- the ultimate cause of all things , since , as the will and all other_things finally rest in their end , so He , who_-isaia- the Divine Goodness and the Mutual Love of the Father and Son , completes and perfects , by His strong yet gentle power , the secret work of man s eternal_salvation . '' In Him are all things '' : in Him , referring to the Holy Ghost . The Holy Ghost and the Incarnation . Having thus paid the due tribute of faith and worship owing to the Blessed Trinity , and which ought to be more_and_more inculcated upon the Christian people , we now turn to the exposition of the power of theHoly Ghost . And , first of all , we must look to Christ , the Founder of the Churchand the Redeemer of our race . Among the external operations of God , the highestof all -isaia- the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word , in which_the splendour ofthe divine perfections shines_forth so brightly that nothing_more sublime caneven be imagined , nothing else could have_been more salutary to the human_race . Now this_work , although belonging to the whole Trinity , -isaia- still appropriatedespecially to the Holy Ghost , so that the Gospels thus speak of the BlessedVirgin : '' She was found with child of the Holy Ghost , '' and '' thatwhich -isaia- conceived in her -isaia- of the Holy Ghost '' Matt . Andthis -isaia- rightly attributed to Him who_-isaia- the love of the Father and the Son , since_this '' great mystery of piety '' Tim . , proceeds fromthe infinite love of God towards man , as St . John tells us : '' God so lovedthe world as to give His only_begotten Son '' John iii . Moreover , human_nature was thereby elevated to a personal union with the Word ; and thisdignity -isaia- given , not on account of any merits , but entirely and absolutelythrough grace , and therefore , as it were , through the special gift of the HolyGhost . Augustine writes : '' This manner in which Christ wasborn of the Holy Ghost , indicates to us the grace of God , by which humanity , with no antecedent merits , -atti_degli_apostoli- the first moment of its existence , was united withthe Word of God , by so intimate a personal union , that He , who was_the Son ofMan , was_also the Son of God , and He who was_the Son of God was_also the Son ofMan '' Enchir . By the operation ofthe Holy Spirit , not_only was_the conception of Christ accomplished , but alsothe sanctification of His soul , which , in Holy Scripture , -isaia- called His '' anointing '' Acts x . Wherefore all His actions were '' performed in the Holy Ghost '' St . , andespecially the sacrifice of Himself : '' Christ , through the Holy Ghost , offered Himself without spot to God '' Heb . Considering this , noone can be surprised that all the gifts of the Holy Ghost inundated the soul ofChrist . In Him resided the absolute fullness of grace , in the greatest and mostefficacious manner possible ; in Him were all the treasures of wisdom andknowledge , graces gratis datae , virtues , and all other gifts foretold in theprophecies of Isaias Is . , , and also signified in that miraculous dove which appeared -atti_degli_apostoli- the Jordan , when Christ , by His baptism , consecrated its waters for a new sacrament . On this_the words of St . Augustine may appropriately be quoted : '' It would be absurd to say that Christ received_the Holy Ghost when He was already thirty years of age , for He came to His baptism without sin , and therefore not_without the Holy Ghost . At this_time , then that_-isaia- , -atti_degli_apostoli- His baptism , He was pleased to prefigure His Church , in which those especially who_are baptized receive the Holy Ghost '' De . Therefore , by the conspicuous apparition of the Holy Ghost over Christ and by His invisible power in His soul , the twofold mission of the Spirit -isaia- foreshadowed , namely , His outward and visible mission in the Church , and His secret indwelling in the souls of the just . The Holy Ghost and the Church . The Church which , already conceived , came forth_from the side of the second Adam in His sleep on the Cross , first showed herself before the eyes of men on the great day of Pentecost . On that day the Holy Ghost began to manifest His gifts in the mystic body of Christ , by that miraculous outpouring already foreseen by the prophet Joel ii . , , for the Paraclete '' sat upon the apostles as though new spiritual crowns were placed upon their heads in tongues of fire '' S . Then the apostles '' descended from the mountain , '' as St . John Chrysostom writes , '' not bearing in their hands tables of stone like Moses , but carrying the Spirit in their mind , and pouring forth the treasure and the fountain of doctrines and graces '' In Matt . Thus was fully accomplished that last promise of Christ to His apostles of sending the Holy Ghost , who_was to complete and , as it were , to seal the deposit of doctrine committed to them under His inspiration . '' I have yet many things to say to you , but you cannot bear them now ; but_when He , the Spirit of Truth , shall come , He will teach you all truth '' John xvi . For He who_-isaia- the Spirit of Truth , inasmuch as He proceedeth both from the Father , who_-isaia- the eternally True , and from the Son , who_-isaia- the substantial Truth , receiveth from each both His essence and the fullness of all truth . This truth He communicates to His Church , guarding her by His all powerful help from ever falling into error , and aiding her to foster daily more_and_more the germs of divine doctrineand to make_them fruitful for the welfare of the peoples . And since_the welfareof the peoples , for_which the Church was established , absolutely requires thatthis office should be continued for all time , the Holy Ghost perpetuallysupplies life and strength to preserve and increase the Church . '' I will askthe Father , and He will_give you another Paraclete , that He may abide with youfor ever , the Spirit of Truth '' john xiv . By Him the bishops are constituted , and by their_ministry are multiplied not_only the children , but_also the fathers that_-isaia- to say , the priests to rule and feed the Church by that Blood wherewith Christ has redeemed Her . '' The Holy Ghost hath placed you bishops to rule_the Church of God , which He bath purchased with His own Blood '' Acts xx . And both bishops and priests , by the miraculous gift of the Spirit , have_the power of absolving sins , according to those words of Christ to the Apostles : '' Receive ye the Holy Ghost ; whose sins you shall forgive they_are forgiven them , and whose you shall retain they_are retained '' John xx . That the Church -isaia- a divine institution -isaia- most clearly proved by the splendour and glory of those gifts and graces with_which she_-isaia- adorned , and whose author and giver -isaia- the Holy Ghost . Let it suffice to state that , as Christ -isaia- the Head of the Church , so -isaia- the Holy Ghost her soul . '' What the soul -isaia- in our body , that_-isaia- the Holy Ghost in Christ s body , the Church '' St . This being so , no further and fuller '' manifestation and revelation of the Divine Spirit '' may be imagined or expected ; for that_which now takes_place in the Church -isaia-_the_most perfect possible , and will last until that day when_the Church herself , having passed through_her militant career , shall be taken up into the joy of the saints triumphing in heaven . The Holy Ghost in the Souls of the Just . The manner and extent of the action of the Holy Ghost in individual souls -isaia- no less wonderful , although somewhat more difficult to understand , inasmuch as it -isaia- entirely invisible . This outpouring of the Spirit -isaia- so abundant , that Christ Himself , from whose gift it proceeds , compares it to an overflowing river , according to those words of St . John : '' He that believeth in Me , as the Scripture saith , out of his midst shall flow rivers of livingwater '' ; to which testimony the Evangelist adds the explanation : '' Nowthis He said of the Spirit which they_should receive who believed in Him '' John vii . It -isaia- indeed true_that in those of the just who livedbefore Christ , the Holy Ghost resided by grace , as we read in the Scripturesconcerning the prophets , Zachary , John the Baptist , Simeon , and Anna ; so that onPentecost the Holy Ghost did_not communicate Himself in such_a_way '' as thenfor the first time to begin to dwell in the saints , but by pouring Himself forthmore abundantly ; crowning , not beginning His gifts ; not commencing a new work , but giving more abundantly '' St . Leo the Great , Hom . Butif they_also were numbered among the children of God , they_were in a state likethat of servants , for '' as long as the heir -isaia- a child he differeth nothingfrom a servant , but_-isaia- under tutors and governors '' Gal . Moreover , not_only was their justice derived_from the merits of Christ who wasto come , but the communication of the Holy Ghost after Christ was much moreabundant , just as the price surpasses in value the earnest and the realityexcels the image . John declares : '' As yet the Spirit was notgiven , because Jesus was not_yet glorified '' John vii . So soon , therefore , as Christ , '' ascending on high , '' entered into possession ofthe glory of His Kingdom which He had won with so much labour , He munificentlyopened out the treasures of the Holy Ghost : '' He gave gifts to men '' Eph . For '' that giving or sending forth of the Holy Ghost afterChrist s glorification was to be such as had never been before ; not_that therehad been none before , but it had not_been of the same kind '' St . Human nature_-isaia- by necessity the servant of God : '' The creature -isaia- a servant ; we are the servants of God by nature '' St . On account , however , of original_sin , our whole nature had fallen into such guilt and dishonour that we had become enemies to God . '' We were by nature the children of wrath '' Eph . There was no power which_could raise us and deliver us from this ruin and eternal destruction . But God , the Creator of mankind and infinitely merciful , did this through His only_begotten Son , by whose benefit it was brought_about that_man was restored so that rank and dignity whence he had fallen , and was adornedwith still_more abundant graces . No one_can express the greatness of this workof divine_grace in the souls of men . Wherefore , both in Holy Scripture and inthe writings of the fathers , men_are styled regenerated , new creatures , partakers of the Divine Nature , children of God , god like , and similar epithets . Now these great blessings are justly attributed as especially belonging to theHoly Ghost . He -isaia- '' the Spirit of adoption of sons , whereby we cry : Abba , Father . '' He fills our_hearts with the sweetness of paternal love : '' TheSpirit Himself giveth testimony to our spirit that_we_are the sons of God '' Rom . This truth accords with the similitude observed by theAngelic Doctor between both operations of the Holy Ghost ; for through Him '' Christ was conceived in holiness to be by nature the Son of God , '' and '' others are sanctified to be the sons of God by adoption '' St . This spiritual generation proceeds from love in a much morenoble manner than the natural : namely , from the untreated Love . The beginnings of this regeneration and renovation of man are by Baptism . In this_sacrament , when_the unclean spirit_has been expelled from the soul , the Holy Ghost enters in and makes it like to Himself . '' That which_-isaia- born of the Spirit , -isaia- spirit '' John iii . The same Spirit gives Himself more abundantly in Confirmation , strengthening and confirming Christian life ; from which proceeded the victory of the martyrs and the triumph of the virgins over temptations and corruptions . We have_said that the Holy Ghost gives Himself : '' the charity of God -isaia- poured out into our_hearts by the Holy Ghost who_-isaia- given to us '' Rom . For He not_only brings to us His divine gifts , but_-isaia- the Author of them and -isaia- Himself the supreme Gift , who , proceeding from the mutual love of the Father and the Son , -isaia- justly believed to be and -isaia- called '' Gift of God most High . '' To show the nature and efficacy of this_gift it -isaia- well to recall_the explanation given by the doctors of the Church of the words of Holy Scripture . They say that God -isaia- present and exists in all things , '' by His power , in so far as all things_are subject to His power ; by His presence , inasmuch as all things_are naked and open to His eyes ; by His essence , inasmuch as he -isaia- present to all as the cause of their being . But God -isaia- in man , not_only as in inanimate things , but because he ismore fully known and loved by him , since even by nature we spontaneously love , desire , and seek after_the good . Moreover , God by grace resides in the just soulas in a temple , in a most intimate and peculiar manner . From this proceeds thatunion of affection by which_the soul adheres most closely to God , more so thanthe friend -isaia- united to his_most loving and beloved friend , and enjoys God inall fulness and sweetness . Now this wonderful union , which_-isaia- properly called '' indwelling , '' differing only in degree or state from that_with whichGod beatifies the saints in heaven , although it -isaia- most certainly produced bythe presence of the whole Blessed Trinity '' We will come to Him and make ourabode with Him , '' John xiv . nevertheless -isaia- attributed in a peculiarmanner to the Holy Ghost . For , whilst traces of divine power and wisdom appeareven in the wicked man , charity , which , as it were , -isaia- the special mark of theHoly Ghost , -isaia- shared in only by the just . In harmony_with this , the same Spiritis called Holy , for He , the first and supreme Love , moves souls and leads themto sanctity , which ultimately consists in the love of God . Wherefore the apostlewhen calling us to the temple of God , does_not expressly mention the Father orthe Son , or the Holy Ghost : '' Know ye not that_your members are the templeof the Holy Ghost , who_-isaia- in you , whom_you have from God ? '' Cor . The fullness of divine gifts -isaia- in many_ways a consequence of the indwelling ofthe Holy Ghost in the souls of the just . Thomas teaches , '' whenthe Holy Ghost proceedeth as love , He proceedeth in the character of the firstgift ; whence Augustine with_that , through the gift which_-isaia- the Holy Ghost , manyother special gifts are distributed among the members of Christ . Among these giftsare those secret warnings and invitations , which from time to time are excitedin our minds and hearts by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost . Without thesethere -isaia- no beginning of a good life , no progress , no arriving -atti_degli_apostoli- eternalsalvation . And since these_words and admonitions are uttered in the soul in anexceedingly secret manner , they_are sometimes aptly compared in Holy Writ to thebreathing of a coming breeze , and the Angelic Doctor likens them to themovements of the heart which_are wholly hidden in the living body . '' Thy heart has a certain hidden power , and therefore the Holy Ghost , who invisibly vivifies and unites the Church , -isaia- compared to the heart . More than_this , the just man , that_-isaia- to say he who lives the life of divine_grace , and acts by the fitting virtues as by means of faculties , has need of those seven gifts which_are properly attributed to the Holy Ghost . By means of them the soul -isaia- furnished and strengthened so as to obey more_easily and promptly His voice and impulse . Wherefore these gifts are of such efficacy that_they lead the just man to the highest degree of sanctity ; and of such excellence that_they continue to exist even in heaven , though in a more_perfect way . By means of these gifts the soul -isaia- excited and encouraged to seek after and attain the evangelical beatitudes , which , like the flowers that come forth in the spring time , are the signs and harbingers of eternal beatitude . Lastly there are_those blessed fruits , enumerated by the Apostle Gal . , , which_the Spirit , even in this mortal life , produces and shows forth in the just ; fruits filled_with all sweetness and joy , inasmuch as they proceed from the Spirit , '' who_-isaia- in the Trinity the sweetness of both Father and Son , filling all creatures with infinite fullness and profusion . The Divine Spirit , proceeding from the Father and the Word in the eternal light of sanctity , Himself both Love and Gift , after_having manifested Himself through the veils of figures in the Old Testament , poured forth all his fullness upon Christ and upon His mystic Body , the Church ; and called back by his presence and grace men who_were going away in wickedness and corruption with_such salutary effect that , being no longer of the earth earthy , they relished and desired quite other_things , becoming of heaven heavenly . On Devotion to the Holy Ghost . These sublime truths , which so clearly show forth the infinite goodness of the Holy Ghost towards us , certainly demand that_we_should direct towards Him the highest homage of our love and devotion . Christians may do this_most effectually if they_will daily strive to know Him , to love Him , and to implore Him more earnestly ; for_which reason may this Our exhortation , flowing spontaneously from a paternal heart , reach their ears . Perchance there are_still to be found among_them , even nowadays , some , who if asked , as were those of old bySt . Paul the Apostle , whether_they have_received the Holy Ghost , might answer inlike manner : '' We have not_so_much as heard whether there be a HolyGhost '' Acts xix . At least there_are certainly many who_are verydeficient in their religious practices , but their faith_-isaia- involved in muchdarkness . Wherefore all preachers and those having care of souls should rememberthat it -isaia- their_duty to instruct their_people more diligently and more fullyabout the Holy Ghost avoiding , however , difficult and subtle controversies , andeschewing the dangerous folly of those_who rashly endeavour to pry into divinemysteries . What should be chiefly dwelt upon and clearly explained -isaia- themultitude and greatness of the benefits which_have_been bestowed , and areconstantly bestowed , upon us by this Divine Giver , so that errors and ignoranceconcerning matters of such moment may be entirely dispelled , as unworthy of '' the children of light . '' We urge this , not only_because it affects amystery by which_we_are directly guided to eternal_life , and which musttherefore be firmly believed ; but also_because the more_clearly and fully thegood -isaia- known the more earnestly it -isaia- loved . Now we owe to the Holy Ghost , aswe mentioned in the second place , love , because He -isaia- God : '' Thou shalt lovethe Lord thy God with thy whole heart , and with thy whole soul , and with thywhole strength '' Deut . He -isaia-_also to be loved because He -isaia- thesubstantial , eternal , primal Love , and nothing_-isaia- more lovable than love . Andthis all the more because He has overwhelmed us with the greatest benefits , which both testify to the benevolence of the Giver and claim the gratitude ofthe receiver . This love has a twofold and most conspicuous utility . In the firstplace it will excite us to acquire daily a clearer knowledge about the HolyGhost ; for , as the Angelic Doctor says , '' the lover -isaia- not content with thesuperficial knowledge of the beloved , but striveth to inquire intimately intoall that appertains to the beloved , and thus to penetrate into the interior ; asis said of the Holy Ghost , Who -isaia- the Love of God , that He searcheth even theprofound things of God '' Cor . In the second place it will obtain for us a still_more abundant supply ofheavenly gifts ; for whilst a narrow heart contracteth the hand of the giver , a grateful and mindful heart causeth it to expand . Yet we must strive that_this love should be of such a nature as not to consist merely in dry speculations or external observances , but_rather to run forward towards action , and especially to fly from sin , which_-isaia- in a more special manner offensive to the Holy Spirit . For whatever we are , that_we_are by the divine goodness ; and this goodness -isaia- specially attributed to the Holy Ghost . The sinner offends this his Benefactor , abusing His gifts ; and taking advantage of His goodness becomes more hardened in sin day_by_day . Again , since He -isaia- the Spirit of Truth , whosoever faileth by weakness or ignorance may perhaps have some excuse before Almighty God ; but he who resists the truth through malice and turns away from it , sins most grievously against the Holy Ghost . In our days this sin has become so frequent that_those dark times seem to have come which_were foretold by St . Paul , in which men , blinded by the just judgment of God , should_take falsehood for truth , and should believe in '' the prince of this_world , '' who_-isaia- a liar and the father thereof , as a teacher of truth : '' God shall send them the operation of error , to believe lying Thess . In the last times some shall depart from the faith , giving heed to spirits of error and the doctrines of devils '' Tim . But since_the Holy Ghost , as We have_said , dwells in us as in His temple , We must repeat the warning of the Apostle : '' Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God , whereby you_are sealed '' Eph . Nor -isaia- it enough to fly from sin ; every Christian ought to shine with the splendour of virtue so as to be pleasing to so great and so beneficent a guest ; and first of all with chastity and holiness , for chaste and holy things befit the temple . Hence the words of the Apostle : '' Know you not_that you_are the temple of God , and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ? But if any man violate the temple of God , him shall God destroy . For the temple of God -isaia- holy , which_you are '' Cor . , : a terrible , indeed , but a just warning . Lastly , we ought to pray to and invoke the Holy Spirit , for each_one of usgreatly needs His protection and His help . The more a man_-isaia- deficient inwisdom , weak in strength , borne down with trouble , prone to sin , so ought he themore to fly to Him who_-isaia- the never ceasing fount of light , strength , consolation , and holiness . And chiefly that first requisite of man , theforgiveness of sins , must be sought for from Him : '' It -isaia- the special character of the Holy Ghost that He -isaia- the Gift of the Father and the Son . Now the remission of all sins -isaia- given by the Holy Ghost as by the Gift of God '' Summ . Concerning this Spirit the words of the Liturgy are_very explicit : '' For He -isaia- the remission of all sins '' Roman Missal , Tuesday after Pentecost . How He should be invoked -isaia- clearly taught by the Church , who addresses Him in humble supplication , calling upon Him by the sweetest of names : '' Come , Father of the poor ! Come , Giver of gifts ! Come , Light of our_hearts ! O , best of Consolers , sweet Guest of the soul , our refreshment ! '' Hymn , Veni Sancte Spiritus . She earnestly implores Him to wash , heal , water our minds and hearts , and to give to us who trust in Him '' the merit of virtue , the acquirement of salvation , and joy everlasting . '' Nor can it be in any_way doubted that He will listen to such prayer , since we read the words written by His own inspiration : '' The Spirit Himself asketh for us with unspeakable groanings '' Rom . Lastly , we ought confidently and continually to beg of Him to illuminate us daily more_and_more with His light and inflame us with His charity : for , thus inspired with_faith and love , we may press onward earnestly towards our eternal reward , since He '' -isaia- the pledge of our inheritance '' Eph . Such , Venerable Brethren , are the teachings and exhortations which We haveseen good to utter , in order to stimulate devotion to the Holy Ghost . We have nodoubt that , chiefly by means of your zeal and earnestness , they_will bearabundant fruit among Christian peoples . We Ourselves shall never in the futurefail to labour towards so important an end ; and it -isaia- even Our intention , inwhatever ways may appear suitable , to further cultivate and extend thisadmirable work of piety . Meanwhile , as two years_ago , in Our Letter ProvidaMatris , We recommended to Catholics special prayers -atti_degli_apostoli- the Feast of Pentecost , for the Re union of Christendom , so now We desire to make certain furtherdecrees on the same subject . An Annual Novena Decreed . Wherefore , We decree and command that throughout_the whole Catholic Church , this_year and in every subsequent year , a Novena shalltake place before Whit Sunday , in all parish churches , and also , if the local Ordinaries think fit , in other_churches and oratories . To all who take_part in this Novena and duly pray_for Our intention , We grant for each_day an Indulgence of seven years and seven quarantines ; moreover , a Plenary Indulgence on any_one of the days of the Novena , or on Whit Sunday itself , or on any day during the Octave ; provided they_shall have_received the Sacraments of Penance and the Holy Eucharist , and devoutly prayed for Our intention . We will that_those_who are legitimately prevented from attending the Novena , or who_are in places_where the devotions cannot , in the judgment of the Ordinary , be conveniently carried_out in church , shall equally enjoy_the same benefits , provided they_make the Novena privately and observe the other conditions . Moreover We are pleased to grant , in perpetuity , from the Treasury of the Church , that whosoever , daily during the Octave of Pentecost up to Trinity Sunday inclusive , offer again publicly or privately any prayers , according_to_their devotion , to the Holy Ghost , and satisfy the above conditions , shall a second time gain each of the same Indulgences . All these Indulgences We also permit to be applied to the suffrage of the souls in Purgatory . And now Our mind_and_heart turn back to those hopes with_which We began , andfor the accomplishment of which We earnestly pray , and will_continue to pray , tothe Holy Ghost . Unite , then , Venerable Brethren , your prayers with Ours , and atyour exhortation let all Christian peoples add their prayers also , invoking thepowerful and ever acceptable intercession of the Blessed Virgin . You know wellthe intimate and wonderful relations existing between her and the Holy Ghost , sothat she_-isaia- justly called His Spouse . The intercession of the Blessed Virgin wasof great avail both in the mystery of the Incarnation and in the coming of theHoly Ghost upon the Apostles . May she continue to strengthen our prayers withher suffrages , that , in the midst of all the stress and trouble of the nations , those divine prodigies may be happily revived by the Holy Ghost , which wereforetold in the words of David : '' Send forth Thy Spirit and they_shall becreated , and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth '' Ps . As a pledge of Divine favour and a testimony of Our affection , Venerable Brethren , to you , to your Clergy , andpeople , We gladly impart in the Lord the Apostolic Benediction . Peter s , in Rome , on the th day of May , , in the th year of Our Pontificate .
