Slavery and the Church The maternal love of the Catholic Church embraces all people . As you_know , venerable brother , the Church from the beginning sought to completely eliminateslavery , whose wretched yoke has oppressed many_people . It -isaia- the industriousguardian of the teachings of its Founder who , by His words and those of theapostles , taught men the fraternal necessity which unites the whole_world . FromHim we recall that everybody has sprung from the same source , was redeemed bythe same ransom , and -isaia- called to the same eternal happiness . He assumed theneglected cause of the slaves and showed Himself the strong champion of freedom . Insofar as time and circumstances allowed , He gradually and moderatelyaccomplished His goal . Of course , pressing constantly with prudence andplanning , He showed what He was striving for in the name of religion , justice , and humanity . In this_way He put national prosperity and civilization in generalinto His debt . This zeal of the Church for liberating the slaves has notlanguished with the passage of time ; on the contrary , the more it bore fruit , the more eagerly it glowed . There are incontestable historical documents whichattest to thatfact , documents which commended to posterity the names of many of Our predecessors . Gregory the Great , Hadrian I , Alexander III , Innocent III , Gregory IX , Pius II , Leo X , Paul III , Urban VIII , Benedict XIV , Pius VII , and Gregory XVI stand out . They applied every_effort to eliminate the institution of slavery wherever it existed . They also took care lest the seeds of slavery return to those places from which_this evil institution had_been cut away . Actions of the Present Pope . We could_not repudiate such a laudable inheritance . For this_reason , We have_taken every occasion to openly condemn this gloomy plague of slavery . We worked toward this goal in a letter sent to the bishops of Brazil on May , . In it We rejoiced over their exemplary accomplishments , both private and public , in the area of emancipation . At the same_time We showed how_much slavery opposes religion and human_dignity . While writing , We were deeply moved by the plight of those_who_are subject to the mastery of another . We were bitterly afflicted by accounts of the trials which harass all the inhabitants of the African interior . How horrible it -isaia- to recall that almost four hundred thousand Africans of every_age and sex are forcefully taken away each year from their villages ! Bound and beaten , they_are transported to a foreignland , put on display , and sold like cattle . These eyewitness reports have beenconfirmed by recent explorers to equatorial Africa , arousing Our desire to helpthose wretched men and to alleviate their lamentable condition . For this reasonWe have immediately delegated the task of going to the principal countries ofEurope to Our beloved son Charles Martial Cardinal Lavigerie , whose swiftnessand apostolic zeal are well_known . He -isaia- to show how shameful this base dealingis and to incline the leaders and citizens to assist this miserable race . Therefore , We should feel grateful to Christ our Lord , the most loving Redeemerof all nations . He in His goodness did not_allow Our efforts to go unrewarded . Rather , He planted them in fertile soil , like a seed which promises a joyfulharvest . Secular leaders and Catholics from the whole_world , everybody who deemsholy the natural rights of people , struggle to discover the rationale and meansto eradicate this inhuman commerce . There was a meeting not long ago in Brusselsfor the representatives of European leaders , and more recently a group ofprivate citizens met in Paris for the same purpose . They clearly showed how muchforce and persistence they_would use to defend the Negro cause , how manydifficulties oppress these slaves . Therefore , with the occasion once againgiven , We praise and thank the leaders of Europe for their_efforts in thismatter . We strenuously pray that almighty God might give a happy outcome to thedeliberations they_have begun . Besides protecting freedom , another more_serious apostolic concern orders Usto spread the teaching of the Gospel in Africa . This teaching should bathe thoseinhabitants living in darkness and blind superstition with the light of divinetruth , by which_they can become co heirs with Us of the kingdom of God . We arethe more concerned about_this because those_who_have received this light havealso shaken off the yoke of human slavery . Wherever Christian customs and lawsare in force , wherever religion establishes that_men serve justice and honorhuman dignity , wherever the spirit of brotherly_love taught by Christ spreadsitself , there neither slavery nor savage barbarism can exist . Rather , mildnessof character and civilized Christian liberty flourishthere . Many apostolic men , like standard bearing soldiers of Christ , go to the African interior to shed their sweat , even life_itself for the welfare of their_brothers . But '' the harvest indeed -isaia- great ; the laborers are few . '' Therefore , many_others are needed where that scandalous commerce -isaia- conducted . They must be full of the spirit of God , fearing neither danger , nor inconveniences , nor labors to spread the teaching of Christ , which_-isaia- joined to true freedom . This might enlighten even that wretched part of the human_race with the revelation of His divinity and release it from the mire of superstition and misery in which it has lain abandoned and neglected for so long . The money collected in the churches and chapels under your jurisdictionshould be sent to Rome , to the Sacred Council for the Propagation of the Faith . It will divide the money among the missions which now exist or will beestablished primarily to eliminate slavery in Africa . The money coming fromthose countries which have_their own Catholic missions to free the slaves , as Wementioned , will be given to sustain and help those missions . The Sacred Councilwill divide the rest of the money among_those missions which show the greatestneed , according to its discretion . We are confident that God who_-isaia- rich inmercies will graciously receive Our prayers for the unfortunate Africans . You , venerable brother , should strive to complete this_matter . Timely and specialassistance should be given by the faithful to abolish the blemish of humancommerce and to support the messengers of the Gospel in those places whereslavery exists . We trust that_nothing will diminish the generosity with whichthe faithful customarily support Catholic missions , once the money istransferred to the Institute '' For the Propagation of the Faith . '' Call to Common Action . This salutary work_which We have long since commended to the zeal of thefaithful demands many_others of similar scope . A great outlay -isaia- required toprovide for the education of missionaries , long journeys , constructingbuildings , erecting churches , and teaching , as well as for other similarnecessities . These expenses must be borne for some years , until the heralds ofthe gospel can establish themselves and take responsibility_for their ownfinancial affairs . We hope_that We have enough strength to undertakesuch a project . When serious difficulties obstruct Us , We turn to you_,_venerable brother , and the other bishops , as well as all Catholics . We commend such a holy and salutary work to your love and to theirs . We desire_that everybody participates ; even if the collection -isaia- small , the burden spread among many_people will_make it lighter for all . Thus , the grace of Christ for_this concerns the spreading of His kingdom might reach everybody and give everybody a share in peace , forgiveness of sins , and special gifts . Therefore , We decree that_every year , wherever the Epiphany of the Lord iscelebrated , on that day a collection should be taken up to help in the projectWe have just outlined . We have chosen this_day in preference to others because , as you well know , that_-isaia- the day the Son of God first revealed Himself to thenations , when He showed Himself to the Magi . They were called '' the firstfruits of our vocation and faith '' by Our predecessor St . Leo the Great . Thus , We depend on the good hope to come that Christ the Lordwill be moved by the love and prayers of the faithful , who have_received thelight of truth . In a new testimony of praise , We pray that He extend His bountyfar and wide and that it flourish in happy prosperity . Meanwhile , We lovinglyimpart Our apostolic_blessing on you_,_venerable brother , on the clergy , and onthe faithful entrusted_to_your pastoral vigilance . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on November , , in the thirteenth yearof Our pontificate .
