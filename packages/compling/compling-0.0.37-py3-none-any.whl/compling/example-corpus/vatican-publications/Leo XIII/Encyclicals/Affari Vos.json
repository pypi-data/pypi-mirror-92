Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . We can scarcely address you , which we most willingly do from our_heart , without remembering the mutual goodwill and that continuous interchange of good offices which_have ever existed between_the Apostolic See and the Canadian people . The love of the Catholic Church stood by the cradle of your State , and since_the time_when she received you into her_maternal arms has_never ceased to hold you in a close embrace , to foster you , and to load you with_good things . The great works which that_man of immortal memory , Fran\u00e7ois de Montmorency Laval , wrought so successfully and so holily for the good of your_country , of which your ancestors were witnesses , he accomplished through the support of the authority and favour of the Roman Pontiffs . And it was from no other source that the works of the Bishops who succeeded him , and who_were men of such signal merits , took their origin and drew their hopes of success . In the same_way , too , to go still further back , it was under the inspiration and on the initiative of the Apostolic See that noble bands of missionaries journeyed to your_country , carrying along_with the light of Christian wisdom a more elevated culture and the first seeds of civilization . And it was by these seeds , which_were gradually ripened by the arduous labour of these_men , that the Canadian people won a place on a level with the most civilized and most glorious nations and thus became , though late in the field , their rival . All this it -isaia- pleasant for us to recall , and the more so because we see the fruits of it , and they_are by no means small , still remaining . The greatest of all these fruits assuredly -isaia- that amongst the multitude of Catholics there_-isaia- a love and an ardent zeal for that divine religion which your ancestors , in the first_place from France , then from Ireland , and others from elsewhere , so religiously professed themselves and transmitted inviolate to their_children . And if those children faithfully preserve this precious heritage it -isaia- easy for us to understand how_much praise -isaia- due to your vigilance and activity , Venerable Brethren , and to the zeal of your_clergy ; for all work assiduously with one heart and one soul for the preservation and progress of the Catholic faith , and , to render this tribute to the truth , without meeting any disfavour or obstacle on the part of the laws of the British Empire . Accordingly , when out of appreciation for your common merits , we some years_ago conferred the honour of the Roman purple upon the Archbishop of Quebec , it was our desire not_only to acknowledge his personal qualities , but_also to render a solemn homage to all Catholics in the country . As regards the education of the young , upon which rest the best hopes of religious and civil_society , the Apostolic See has_never ceased to work zealously in concert with you and your predecessors . Thus numerous institutions for the moral and scientific education of your children have_been founded under the favour and protection of the Church . Amongst these the great University of Quebec , adorned and strengthened with all the dignity and rights which_the Apostolic authority_-isaia- accustomed to confer , assuredly occupies the place of honour , and stands as sufficient witness that the Apostolic See had no greater desire or care than the formation of a race of citizens as distinguished by its intellectual culture as it -isaia- rendered commendable by its virtues . Wherefore , it -isaia- with the greatest solicitude , as you yourselves can easily understand , that_we_have followed the misfortunes which_have lately marked the history of Catholic education in Manitoba . For it -isaia-_our wish and it -isaia-_our duty to endeavour by every_means in our power to bring it about_that no harm befall the faith and religion of so many thousands of souls , the salvation of which_has_been especially entrusted to us , in a State which received_the first rudiments of Christian teaching as well as of civilization from the Catholic Church . And since very many expect a pronouncement from us upon this_question , and look to us to point_out what course they_should pursue , we determined not to come to any conclusion upon the matter until our Delegate Apostolic had examined it upon the spot . Charged to make a careful survey of the situation and to report upon it to us , he has with fidelity and ability fulfilled the task we imposed upon him . The question -atti_degli_apostoli- Issue . The question -atti_degli_apostoli- issue -isaia- assuredly one of the highest and most serious importance . The decisions arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- seven years_ago on the school question by the Parliament of the province of Manitoba must be remembered . The Act of Union of the Confederation had secured to Catholics the right to be educated in the public schools according_to_their consciences ; and yet this right the Parliament of Manitoba abolished by a contrary law . This -isaia- a noxious law . For our children cannot go for instruction to schools which either ignore or of set purpose combat the Catholic religion , or in which its teachings are despised and its fundamental principles repudiated . Wherever the Church has allowed this to be done , it has only been with pain and through necessity , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time surrounding her_children with many safeguards which , nevertheless it has_been too_often recognized have_been insufficient to cope successfully with the danger attending it . Similarly it -isaia- necessary to avoid -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs , as most dangerous , those schools in which all beliefs are welcomed and treated as equal , as if , in what regards God and divine things , it makes no difference whether one believes rightly or wrongly , and takes up with truth or error . You know well , Venerable Brethren , that_every school of this_kind has_been condemned by the Church , because nothing can be more harmful or better calculated to ruin the integrity of the faith and to turn aside the tender minds of the young from the way of truth . The Need of Religious Education . There -isaia- another point upon which those will agree with us who differ from us in everything else ; it -isaia- not by means of a purely scientific education and with vague and superficial notions of morality that Catholic children will leave school such as the country desires and expects . Other serious and important teaching must_be_given to them if they_are to turn out good Christians and upright and honest citizens ; it -isaia- necessary that_they_should be formed on those principles_which , deeply engravers on their consciences , they ought to follow and obey , because_they naturally spring from their_faith and religion . Without religion there_can be no moral education deserving of the name , nor of any good , for the very nature and force of all duty comes_from those special duties which bind man to God , who commands , forbids , and determines what_-isaia-_good and evil . And so , to be desirous that minds should be imbued_with good and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to leave them without religion_-isaia- as senseless as to invite people to virtue after_having taken away the foundations on which it rests . For the Catholic there_-isaia- only_one true religion , the Catholic religion ; and , therefore , when it -isaia-_a_question of the teaching of morality or religion , he can neither accept nor recognize any which_-isaia-_not drawn_from Catholic doctrine . Justice and reason then demand_that the school shall supply our scholars not only_with a scientific system of instruction but_also a body of moral teaching which , as we have_said , -isaia- in harmony_with_the principles of their religion , without_which , far_from_being of use , education can be nothing but harmful . From this comes the necessity of having Catholic masters and reading books and text books approved by the Bishops , of being free to regulate the school in a manner which shall be in full accord with the profession of the Catholic faith as well as with all the duties which flow from it . Furthermore , it -isaia- the inherent right of a father s position to see in what institutions his_children shall be educated , and what masters shall teach them moral precepts . When , therefore , Catholics demand , as it -isaia- their_duty to demand and work , that the teaching given by schoolmasters shall be in harmony_with_the religion of their_children , they_are contending justly . And nothing could be more unjust than to compel them to choose an alternative , or to allow the children to grow up in ignorance or to throw them amid an environment which constitutes a manifest danger for the supreme interests of their_souls . These principles of judgment and action which_are based upon truth and justice , and which form the safeguards of public as well as private interests , it -isaia- unlawful to call in question or in any_way to abandon . And so , when_the new legislation came to strike Catholic education in the Province of Manitoba , it was your duty , Venerable Brethren , publicly to protest against injustice and the blow that had_been dealt ; and the way_in_which you fulfilled this_duty has furnished a striking proof of your individual vigilance and of your true episcopal zeal . Although upon this_point each_one of you finds sufficient approbation in the witness of his_own conscience , know nevertheless that we also join with it our assent and approval . For the things_that you_have sought and still seek to preserve and defend are most_holy . The Need of United Action . Moreover the hardships of the law in question themselves plainly proved that_there was need of complete union if any opportune remedy of the evil was to be found . So good was_the Catholic cause that all fair and honest citizens without distinction of party ought to have_taken common counsel and acted in concert to defend it . Unfortunately , however , and to the great detriment of the cause , just the contrary was done . And what_-isaia- still_more deplorable , Catholic Canadians themselves were unable to act in concert in the defence of interests which so closely touch the common_good , and the importance and moment of which ought to have silenced the interest of political parties , which_are on quite a lower plane of importance . We are_not ignorant that something has_been done to amend the law . The men_who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the head of the Federal Government and of the Government of the Province have_already taken certain measures to diminish the grievances of which_the Catholics of Manitoba rightly persist in complaining . We have no reason to doubt_that these measures have_been inspired by a love of fair dealing and by a good intention . But we cannot conceal the truth . The law made to remedy the evil -isaia- defective , imperfect , insufficient . Catholics demand , and have_the right to demand , much_more . Besides , the arrangements made may fail of their effect , owing to the variations in local circumstances ; enough has not_yet been done in Manitoba for the Catholic education of our children . The claims of justice demand_that this_question should be considered from every point_of_view , that_those unchangeable and sacred principles_which we have enunciated above should be protected and secured . This -isaia- what must be aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- , and this_the end which_must be pursued with zeal and prudence . But there_must not be discord ; there_must be union of mind and harmony of action . As the object does_not impose a line of conduct determinate and exclusive , but , on the contrary , admits of several , as -isaia- usual in such matters , it follows_that there_may be on the line to be followed a certain number of opinions equally good and acceptable . Let none , then , lose sight of the value of moderation , gentleness , and brotherly_love . Let none forget the respect due to his neighbour , but let all , weighing the circumstances , determine what_-isaia- best to be done and act together after_having taken counsel with you . Partial Satisfaction to be Accepted . As to what regards particularly the Catholics of Manitoba , we have confidence that , God helping , they_will one_day obtain full satisfaction . This confidence -isaia- founded , above all , on the goodness of their cause ; next , on the justice and wisdom of those_who govern ; and , lastly , on the good_will of all upright Canadians . In the meantime , until they succeed in their claims , let_them not refuse partial satisfaction . This -isaia- why , wherever the law or administration or the good dispositions of the people offer some means of lessening the evil and of warding off some of the dangers , it -isaia- absolutely expedient and advantageous that_they_should make_use of them and derive all the benefit possible from them . Wherever , on the contrary , there_-isaia- no other remedy we exhort and conjure them to use a generous liberality . They can do nothing better for themselves or more calculated to redound to the welfare of their_country than to contribute , as far as their means will allow , towards_the maintenance of their_own schools . There -isaia- still another point which calls for your united attention . Under your authority , and with the help of those_who direct your schools , a complete course of studies ought to be carefully devised . Special care should be taken that_those_who are employed as teachers should be abundantly provided with all the qualities , natural and acquired , which_are requisite for their profession . It -isaia- only right that Catholic schools , both in their educational methods and in the standard of their teaching , should be able to compete with the best . From the standpoint of intellectual culture and progress , the design conceived by the Canadian provinces for the development of public instruction , for the raising of the standard of education , and making it daily more_and_more refined and perfect , must assuredly be allowed to be honourable and noble . And there_-isaia- no class of study , no progress in human knowledge , which_cannot fully harmonize with Catholic doctrine and teaching . A Word to the Press . Towards the explanation and defence of all that_we_have written those Catholics can very largely contribute whose work_-isaia- on the public and especially on the daily press . Let them then remember their_duty . Let them religiously and courageously defend what_-isaia- true and right , the interests of the Church and of the State , and in such_a_way_that they_do_not outstep the bonds of decorum , avoiding all personalities , and exceeding in nothing . Let them respect and religiously defer to the authority of the Bishops and all other legitimate authority . The more difficult the times and the more threatening the danger of division , the more they ought to strive to show the necessity of that_unity of thought and action without_which there_-isaia- little or no chance of ever obtaining that_which_-isaia- the object of our_common hopes . As a pledge of heavenly grace and a token of Our paternal affection receivethe Apostolic Benediction which We lovingly impart in the Lord to you all , Venerable Brothers , to your_clergy , and to the flocks entrusted_to_your care . Peter s , Rome , on the th day of December , , in the twentieth year of Our pontificate .
