Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Urged on by the most_sacred duty of Our Apostolic office , We have striven earnestly and for a long time , as you yourselves know , that the affairs of the Catholic Church in Prussia should be somewhat improved , and , having_been restored to a position of dignity , they_should flourish with_their former , and more_than their former , honour . Which endeavours and labours of Ours have by God s aid and assistance so far succeeded that We have appeased former strife , and are filled_with hope_that the liberty of the Catholic name may be enjoyed there fully and in peace . But now it -isaia- Our desire to turn Our thoughts and cares with_great earnestness towards_the Bavarians . Not indeed because we think_that the state of religion -isaia-_the_same in Bavaria as it was in Prussia , but We will and desire , that in that Kingdom also , which glories in the profession of the Catholic Faith received_from its forefathers and ancestors , sundry inconveniences which militate against the liberty of the Catholic Church may be speedily abolished . That We may accomplish so salutary a desire , We wish to try every expedient which others may give , and to bring to bear upon it without delay the authority and aid We ourselves possess . And We also especially call_upon you , O Venerable Brethren , and upon all those in Bavaria who by your operation have_become Our dear children , that in whatever may seem to appertain to the care and propagation_of_the_faith and of religion in your_country , We may communicate with you so far as -isaia- in Our power , giving you counsel concerning them and confidently urging them on the rulers of the State . In the sacred records of Bavaria are_many circumstances , but We recall things unknown to you , concerning which_the Church and the State may unite in a common joy . For the Christian faith , from the time_when its divine seed was sown in the bosom of your_country by the care and great diligence of the holy Abbot Severinus , who stands out as the apostle of the country between_the Danube and the Alps , and of other preachers of the gospel , sent forth and fixed its roots so deeply that thenceforward it has_never been utterly eradicated either by the barbarity of superstition or the revolution and change of public affairs . Wherefore it came to pass about the end of the seventh century , that_when Rupert , the holy Bishop of Worms , -atti_degli_apostoli- the invitation of Theodore , Duke of Bavaria , went forth to stir up and increase the Christian faith in those parts , he found indeed , many , both professors of the faith and others desirous of embracing it , even in the midst of superstition . But that_most excellent Prince Theodore himself , inflamed by zeal for the faith , undertook a journey to Rome , and prostrate -atti_degli_apostoli- the Tombs of the Holy Apostles and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of the august Vicar of Jesus Christ , first afforded a most noble example of piety and of the union of Bavaria with this Apostolic See , which other excellent princes afterwards religiously followed . At the same_time Cardinal Martinianus , Bishop of Sabina , was sent as legate to Bavaria by the Holy Pontiff Gregory IL , who brought aid and assistance in Catholic affairs , with whom were associated Georgius and Dorotheus , both Cardinals of the Roman Church . Not long afterwards Corbinianus , Bishop of Munich , a man renowned for his_holiness of life and contempt of the world , who confirmed and increased the effect of the apostolic labours of Rupert by an equal amount of labours , set_out to visit the Sovereign Pontiff -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome . But he to whom beyond others praise -isaia- certainly due , in that he nourished and cherished the faith in Bavaria , -isaia- St . Boniface , the Archbishop of Mayence , who also -isaia- celebrated in an undying and most trustworthy account as the father of Christian Germany , its Apostle and Martyr . He fulfilled the office of legate to the Roman Pontiffs Gregory the Second and Third , and Zachary , in whose favour he stood high , and in their name and by their authority he divided the country of Bavaria into dioceses , and thus , having constituted a regular hierarchy , handed on the faith which_had_been planted there to future generations . Gregory II , writing to Boniface himself , says : '' The field of the Lord , which_was lying waste , and had grown unfruitful through infidelity with the thorns of thistles , being tilled by the ploughshare of Thy doctrine , has_received the seed of the word and brought forth an abundant harvest of faithfulness . From that_time the religion of the Bavarians remained safe and sure through all changes in civil affairs , although in course of time very sharply tried . For indeed there ensued those broils and contentions of the empire against the priesthood which_were so bitter , enduring , and destructive ; in these , however , there_was more to rejoice than to sadden the Church in Bavaria . For with the most perfect unity they stood by Gregory XI , the lawful Pontiff , the unbridled violence of the contenders moving them to neither side , and in vain threatening them , and what_was very trying , a long time afterwards , being in no way moved either by the power or attacks of the followers of Novatus , they always religiously observed the integrity of their_faith and their ancient alliance with the Roman Church . Which courage and firmness of your fathers -isaia- to be the more lauded because this_new sect had brought into subjection nearly all their neighbours . Indeed to the Bavarians who lived in those unhappy times are_very applicable the words of merited praise contained in a letter to their rulers which_the above named Gregory II . had addressed long before to the Catholics of Thuringia , who had_been imbued_with the Christian faith by St . '' Acknowledging the constancy of your firm faith in Christ , which_-isaia- well_known to Us , since when_the pagans endeavoured to force you into an idolatrous worship , you replied in the fulness of your faith_that you would rather die than violate that_faith in Christ which_you had once for all received ; filled_with all joy We give thanks as -isaia- right to our God and Redeemer , the Giver of all good things , by the assistance of Whose grace we desire to raise you to still better and greater things , that_for the strengthening of the intention of your faith you_may cleave with earnest minds to the Holy Apostolic See , and so far as the needs of our holy religion demand you_may receive consolation from this Holy Apostolic See so well remembered by you as the spiritual mother of all the faithful , as indeed it -isaia- fitting_that the joint heirs of a kingdom should receive from their royal parent . Ad optimates Thuring cfe . But although the grace of Our merciful God which in former times preserved and most graciously embraced your nation , bids Us to argue well , and be of good hope_for the future , nevertheless We ought to strive , so far as lies in Our power , to do that_which will be most efficacious in healing the wounds which Our religion may have_received , or in warding them off while still threatening us , so that Our holy Christian doctrine and code of morals may daily spread and bear_fruit more largely . This We do not say as though the Catholic faith were in want of greater and less timid defenders among_you , for We know well , Venerable Brethren , that_you , together_with_the larger and better part both of those in sacred orders and others , are by no means idly callous to the contests and dangers with_which your Church -isaia- surrounded , therefore , as Our predecessor , Pius IX . , in his_most loving letters addressed to the Bishops of Bavaria , Litt . Nihil Nobis gratius , Feb . praised in the highest manner the great earnestness they displayed in preserving the sacred rights of the Church , so We also freely and openly give well deserved praise to each_one of those_who_have bravely undertaken and carried_out the defence of their ancestral faith . But when Our provident God allows His Church to be vexed with grievous storms , He himself justly demands from Us dispositions and powers more prepared to assist her . But you , O Venerable Brethren , each_one equally with Us , behold with grief the strange and unhappy times upon which_the Church has fallen ; you were amongst the first to notice the conditions in which_you are placed , and the difficulties with_which you_have to contend . Wherefore you_know by experience that_your office has greater duties than formerly , and that to perform them well you ought to strive very earnestly for watchfulness , diligence , strength , and Christian prudence . And firstly We urge and exhort you concerning the preparation and welfare of the clergy . For the clergy are like an army , which , as they obey the laws and perform their_duties so that_they_may be of service to the Christian multitude under the authority of the bishops , will_bring honour and stability to public affairs in proportion to their number and discipline . Wherefore this has_always_been the first care of the Church that_she should choose and bring up to the priesthood those young_men , whose dispositions and desires afford a hope that_they_will persevere in the ministry of the Church Conc . , and again , that the young_men should_have been educated from their early years in piety and religion , before evil habits have gained possession of them as young_men , Conc . , and for them she founded proper seats of training and seminaries , and laid_down rules full of wisdom , especially in the holy Council of Trent ibid . , so that_this college of the ministers of God might be a perpetual seminary ibid . In several places indeed , certain laws are in force which , if they_do_not stop , yet hinder the clergy in their training and discipline . We deem that it behoves Us now as -atti_degli_apostoli- other times openly to speak Our mind on this_matter , which_-isaia- of the greatest possible interest , and to preserve the holy law of the Church inviolate by every_means in Our power . For indeed the Church , as a body , which_-isaia- by its_nature perfect , has an inalienable right of ordering and instructing its_own forces , hurtful to none , helpful to many in that kingdom of peace which Jesus Christ founded upon earth for the salvation of the human_race . The clergy , however , will fulfil the duties committed to their charge fully and as a whole when , by the care of the bishops such a disposition of mind and intention has_been brought_about in the sacred seminaries as the dignity of the Christian priesthood and the natural change of times and manners require ; they ought , indeed , to surpass others in the excellence of their teaching , and , which_-isaia- the chief thing , in great reputation for virtue , so that_they_may attract the minds_of_men to it and lead_them to its observance . It -isaia- necessary_that Christian wisdom , which abounds in a wonderful light , should shine before the eyes of all , so that the darkness of ignorance , which_-isaia- the greatest enemy to religion , having_been dispelled , the truth may shine_forth far and wide , and happily reign . Nay more , it behoves that_those manifold errors be refuted and dispelled which , taking their rise either in ignorance or wickedness or prejudiced opinions , perversely call away the minds_of_men from Catholic truth , and engender a certain hatred of it in their dispositions . This great duty , which_-isaia- '' to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers '' Ep . , , belongs to the order of priests , who hold it legitimately , imposed by Christ our Lord when He sent them forth to teach all nations , by His divine power , '' going into the whole_world preach_the_gospel to every_creature '' Mar . , equally plainly as the bishops , chosen in place of the apostles , are set over the Church of God , the priests_are their assistants . If ever these duties have_been fully and perfectly carried_out it was in the first ages of our religion and in the following centuries during that great struggle with heathen tyranny which raged for so long a time , whence the priestly band and the most_holy order of Fathers and Doctors whose wisdom and eloquence will be ever held in memory and admiration , obtained their great glory . For indeed Christian doctrine deeply treated of by them , fully explained , and most valiantly maintained , by that means spread forth the more its truth and divine excellence . On the other_hand appeared the doctrine of the heathens , confuted and despised even by the unlearned , as having no consistency , full of absurdities , useless . But in vain did the adversaries try to arrest and stop that course of Catholic wisdom ; in vain did they seek objections from the schools of Greek philosophy , especially from those of Plato and Aristotle , with high sounding words indeed . For our champions , declining not_even that kind of contest , applied themselves to the learning and study of the heathen philosophers ; having examined with the greatest diligence what each_one of them had professed , they took these_things into consideration one by one ; they examined them , they compared them ; many things were rejected or corrected by them ; not_a_few were justly approved of and accepted ; they_also discovered and established by them , that_those things_which are proved to be false by human_reason and intelligence , are in the same manner opposed to Christian doctrine , so that he who withstands and opposes this_doctrine , of necessity equally withstands and opposes reason . Contests of this_kind were entered into by our fathers , and splendid victories obtained , and these were achieved , not_only by the virtue and arms of faith , but_also by the aid of human_reason ; which indeed , guided by the light of divine wisdom , entered boldly upon the path of truth , from ignorance of many things , and as it were out of a forest of errors . This admirable agreement and consent of the faith with reason , although it has_been honoured by the learned works of many , yet as it were built up in one edifice and shown -atti_degli_apostoli- one view , shines_forth especially in that work of St . Augustine , De Civitate Dei , and equally in the Summa of St . Thomas Aquinas , in which books , indeed , are contained whatever things were deeply thought out and considered by wise men , and in them we may seek for the beginnings and fount of that eminent school of learning called Christian theology . The memory of such illustrious examples should be remembered and cherished by the clergy , since in many_ways ancient weapons are_being sharpened by our adversaries , and nearly the same old battles are to be re fought . Thus only the heathen formerly objected to the Christian religion , that_they_should not be led away from the ancient and accustomed rites of their divinities , but now the most iniquitous endeavour of wicked men contend that_they_should eradicate from Christian people all divine and most necessary teaching connected_with Our holy faith , and that_they_may use them worse than the heathen , and may involve them in the greatest misery , namely , the subversion and contempt of all faith and religion . Of which impure plague , than which none -isaia- more detestable , those were_the founders who attributed to man that by the light of nature each_one could know and judge concerning doctrine divinely revealed by virtue of his_own reason and judgment , and that_there was no necessity to submit to the authority of the Church and the Roman Pontiff , whose sole right it -isaia- , by divine command and appointment to be the guardian of that doctrine , to hand it on and to judge truly concerning it . Thence the way easily opened , though to them it lay open most miserably , for denying and discarding all things and the powers of man : then insolently denying that_there was any authority which emanated from God or even that_there was a God , they -atti_degli_apostoli- length lapsed into absurd theories of Idealism and Materialism . But this prostitution of the highest things , those_who_are named Rationalists or Naturalists do not_hesitate to call by the false name of scientific and social progress , which in truth_-isaia- nothing less_than the destruction and ruin of both . Thus , indeed , Venerable Brethren , you_may know and see why and in what way the younger members of the Church ought to be instructed in higher doctrines that_they perform their_duties with ease and utility -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . That these may be thoroughly grounded and accomplished in the study of humanities they_should not enter upon the study of sacred theology before having undergone a preparation in philosophy . We mean_that deep and real philosophy , the investigator of the loftiest problems , the best patron of truth : by virtue of which they_themselves will_not be tossed about nor carried away '' by every wind of doctrine , by the wickedness of men , by the craftiness by which_they lie in wait to deceive '' Ephes . , and will_enable them to give to other doctrines the aid of truth , by the discussion and refutation of captious and deceptive theories . With this object we have_already advised that the works of the great Aquinas should be in their hands , and should be constantly and carefully explained ; and We have often laid stress upon the same thing with solemn words ; and We believe_that the best fruits are thence received by the clergy , and We shall confidently look for fruits still_more excellent and abundant . Indeed , the method of the Angelic Doctor -isaia- admirably adapted for training minds , wonderfully fitted for use in making comments , in philosophising , in discoursing forcibly and incontrovertibly : for it shows clearly each subject connected one_with another in a continuous series , all however joined together and fitting into each_other , all leading to the highest principles ; then it raises one to the contemplation of God , Who -isaia- the efficient cause and strength and highest type of all things , to Whom finally all philosophy and man_himself , such as he -isaia- , ought to be referred . Thus truly the knowledge of things_are held together , as they_are admirably shown , so also are they most firmly established by St . Thomas ; by conflict with_which knowledge , as the ancient sects of errors have entirely disappeared , so the new , unlike them rather in name and kind than in fact , as soon as they_have put forth their heads fall , laid low by the same blows , as indeed many of Our writers have shown . Truly human_reason desires to penetrate freely into the hidden and secret knowledge of things , nor_can it do otherwise , but_with Aquinas for Our author and master it does this more quickly and freely because it does it safely without_any danger of passing over the boundaries of truth . For neither can you rightly call that liberty which gathers and scatters opinions according to its_own will and pleasure , nay rather it -isaia- to be reputed the vilest license , lying , and false science , a disgrace and slavery of the mind . He indeed -isaia- the true Doctor who walks within_the confines of truth , who not_only never differs from God , the Head and Fount of all truth , but_-isaia- always strictly in accordance_with Him and always follows Him when disclosing His secrets in any manner ; who no less piously listens to the Roman Pontiff when speaking , reverses in him the divine authority and fully holds that '' submission to the Roman Pontiff -isaia- necessary to salvation . contra errores Groecoram . In his school , therefore , let_the cleric be brought up and exercised both in philosophy and theology : for he will then be learned and strong as the mightiest to fight the sacred combats . But it -isaia- scarcely possible to express how_great -isaia- the utility of the light of doctrine which shines from the clergy , and -isaia- poured among the different orders of Christian people , if indeed it shines as it were from a beacon of virtue . For in the precepts which tend to the correction of men s morals , the acts of their masters are of more avail than their precepts , nor will any easily feel confidence when dealing_with one whose deeds do not accord with his_words and precepts . We turn Our eyes and minds to Jesus Christ ; who , as He -isaia- the truth , has taught Us what We ought to believe , as He -isaia- the life and way , has offered Himself to Us a perfect example , how We should lead a good life and eagerly seek after Our final good . He Himself desired His disciples to be ordered and perfected after His own pattern , '' so let your light shine , '' that_-isaia- in doctrine '' before men , that_they_may see your good_works , '' not differing from the principles of your doctrine '' and glorify your Father Who -isaia- in heaven '' Mat . , having combined together the doctrine and excellence of the gospel which He committed to them to preach . It -isaia- right that_those precepts should be divine by which_the life of priests -isaia- ordered and directed . Above all it -isaia- necessary_that they persuade themselves and have it almost written in their_minds , that_they_are now no longer in . the companionship of God , and though passing their time in the communion of the world , still live the life of Christ our Lord . Who if they really live by Him and in Him , will in no way seek '' those things_which are their_own , '' but will be entirely taken up with '' those things_which belong to Jesus Christ '' Philipp . , nor will they receive the empty favour of men , but will seek after_the solid favour of God ; they_will , moreover , abstain from and abhor these lower and contemptible things , and industriously trying to become rich in heavenly blessings , will generously and gladly pour them forth , as -isaia- the part of holy charity ; further , they will_never permit themselves to oppose or prefer their_own to the judgement and will of the bishops , but by obeying and giving way to them as bearing the person of Christ , they_will obtain most happily in the Lord s vineyard abundance of most choice fruit which_will remain with_them forever . But whosoever severs himself in thought or will from his shepherd and from the chief of shepherds , the Roman Pontiff , -isaia- in no way joined to Christ , '' he that heareth you heareth Me , and he that despiseth you despiseth Me '' Luke x . , but whosoever -isaia- separated_from Christ scatters rather_than gathers together whence , moreover , -isaia- evident the kind and measure of consideration due to men_who are placed in positions of public_authority . For it -isaia- by no means intended that any one_should desire to deny or derogate from their_rights ; rather those are to be diligently observed by other citizens , and especially carefully by priests : '' Render to Caesar the things_which are Caesar s . For those functions are_most noble and honourable which God the highest lord and ruler has imposed upon men_who are princes , that , by counsel , reason , and all care of justice they_should govern , preserve , and increase the state . Wherefore let_the clergy carefully attend to and perform every duty as citizens , not after_the manner of one_who_-isaia- servile , but of one_who holds them in reverence , on account of religion , not on account of fear ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with due observance , maintaining their_own dignity , being both citizens and priests of God . But if it should happen that the civil_power should invade the rights of God and of His Church , then let a marked example be set by priests , as every Christian man ought to persevere in the path of duty during times of religious trouble ; let_him bear many things in silence , with unstained virtue ; let_him be cautious in bearing evil deeds , nor let_him ever assent or consent to the wicked in any matter ; but if it be a question of choice which he should do , whether the laws of God were to be broken or men pleased let_him freely use that memorable and most dignified answer of the Apostles : '' We ought to obey God rather_than men . To this , as it were foreshadowed type of educating young_men destined to sacred ends , it -isaia- Our desire and right that We should add what appertains to youth in general : for We are exceedingly anxious as to its education , that it should be rightly and very fully carried_out , both as regards mental culture and training the disposition . The Church has_always cherished the age of youth in her_maternal embrace , for its guardianship she_has most lovingly undertaken many labours and prepared many aids for it ; among which_-isaia- the foundation of many orders of religious men which might train young_people in science and learning , and might especially inculcate Christian wisdom and virtue . Under such auspices it would come to pass that piety towards God would easily imbue their tender minds , after which_the duty of man towards himself , his neighbour , and his country having_been duly set before them , there_-isaia- every hope_that they_would bring forth fruit in due season . There -isaia- therefore a just cause of grief to the Church when_she sees her little ones torn away from her -atti_degli_apostoli- the tenderest age and forced into schools where either the knowledge of God -isaia- passed over in silence , or but a maimed and perverted idea of it taught ; where there_-isaia-_nothing to stem the torrent of error , no faith in divine_revelation , no place_where the truth may defend itself . But truly , to forbid the Catholic Church to use her influence in the abodes of science and literature , -isaia- most injurious , since_the duty of teaching religion , that subject indeed , which no man careful of his eternal_salvation can neglect , has_been_given by God to His Church , but to no other society of men has it been_given , nor_can any_other association take it for itself , she therefore claims it as her undoubted right , and complains when_it_-isaia- neglected . Further We must beware , and the greatest care should be taken , that in schools which_have either wholy or partially cast aside the authority of the Church , the young should incur no danger nor receive any injury to their Catholic faith or good morals . In which indeed the skill of the clergy and other good men will be of great avail , both if they exert themselves that the knowledge of religion should_not only not be driven out of those schools where it exists , but should occupy its due place , and be taught by competent teachers of known ability ; and if also they could find and put into operation any_other safeguards , by which that knowledge may be imparted to their scholars incorrupt and satisfactorily . The counsel and co operation of the heads of families will_also be of use , wherefore there_-isaia- need of warning and exhorting them as far as lies in Our power most earnestly , that_they_should consider what great and holy duties God has imposed upon them with_respect to the education of their_children , that_they_may know their religion and be of good behaviour , serving God religiously ; but_that they_themselves act wrongly if they commit their_children -atti_degli_apostoli- a docile and guileless age to the care of questionable teachers . In these duties , which devolve upon them_with_the procreation of their_children , let_the heads of families know that_there are the same rights inherent both by nature and justice , and that_they_are of such a kind that_no_one can free himself from them , since_it_-isaia- impossible by any human power to be dispensed from those duties which_man owes to God . Let , then , parents consider well that_they_have a great responsibility to bear in the education of their_children , and a still greater one in bringing them up to look for a better and more_perfect life , that of the soul , which when_they_are themselves unable to superintend , it -isaia- their_part to procure the aid of others , so that their_children may hear and receive that knowledge of religion which_-isaia- necessary_for every man from approved teachers . Now , indeed , there_-isaia- not unfrequently a most excellent example of piety and munificence , in that where_there are no public schools open except those_which are_called '' neutral , '' Catholics have opened certain establishments of their_own -atti_degli_apostoli- great labour and expense and maintain them_with an equal zeal . It -isaia- greatly to be wished that_these excellent and safe refuges of youth should be established more_and_more where_the necessities of circumstances or places require . Nor must We pass over in silence the fact_that the Christian education of youth redounds greatly to the advantage of the State itself . Indeed , numberless and very great losses are to be feared for that State in which_the method and discipline of education -isaia- devoid of religion or , what_-isaia- worse , -isaia- opposed to it . For immediately that supreme and divine rule -isaia- laid aside and despised , by whose admonition we are commanded to reverence the authority of God and in reliance upon the same God , to hold all His teachings with the most assured faith , there_-isaia- a tendency of human science to fall_into most grievous errors especially_those of materialism and rationalism . Hence it follows_that each man_-isaia- allowed to follow his_own judgment and inclination as to what he understands , and still_more as to what he does , and forthwith the public_authority of those in power -isaia- weakened and destroyed : for it would be wonderful indeed if those obeyed and endured the rule of man_,_who entertain the baneful opinion that_they_are in no way bound by the governance and rule of God . For once destroy the foundations on which all authority rests and the bond of human society_-isaia- loosened and destroyed , there_will be no State ; a tyranny full of violence and cunning will_take possession of all things . But surely can any State by reliance upon its_own powers ward off so great a calamity ? Can any State do so while refusing the aid of the Church ? Can any State do so when absolutely opposing the Church ? The matter stands open and clear to every prudent person . Prudence in affairs of State itself demands_that their_part in teaching and educating the young should be left to the bishops and clergy , and great care should be taken that the most noble duty of instructing others should_not be left in the hands of those_who_are either careless and lax in their religion or openly averse to the Church . What , however , would be still_more intolerable would be that_men of this character should be selected as professors of religious knowledge , which -isaia-_the_most important of all . It -isaia- likewise a matter of extreme importance , Venerable Brethren , that you_should warn and guard your flocks against the dangers arising from the contagion of Freemasonry . We have in a special Encyclical Letter shown how full of evil and danger to the State -isaia- this sect of darkness , and We have pointed_out means to contract and destroy its influence . The faithful can_never be sufficiently warned against this wicked faction , for although from the very_beginning it conceived a deep hatred against the Catholic Church , and has_ever since increased and inflamed it , its enmity -isaia- not_always openly displayed , but more often exercises itself in an underhand and hypocritical way , especially among the young , who inexperienced and wanting in wisdom , are sadly ensnared by its deceits often concealed by appearances of piety and charity . As to being cautious in regard to those outside the Catholic faith , keep to what_the Church prescribes , so that intercourse with_them or the depravity of their doctrines may_not become a source of danger to a Christian people . We know and regret , as you do , that Our power to ward off such dangers does_not equal Our zeal and Our desire to do so ; nevertheless We do not think it useless to excite your pastoral solicitude and to stimulate -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the activity of Catholics , so that_our united efforts may turn aside , or a least lessen obstacles set in the way of Our common desires . And We exhort you in the words of Our predecessor Leo the Great : '' Be full of pious zeal for religion , and let_the anxiety of all the faithful be aroused against the most cruel enemies of souls . Therefore throwing off their torpid neglect let all good persons embrace the cause of religion and of the Church as their_own , and let_them fight faithfully and constantly on her behalf . Too often the wicked are confirmed in their wickedness and their_power for evil , and win the day by the sluggishness and timidity of good persons . The efforts and zeal of Catholics have_not indeed always the effect intended and to be expected ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli- heart they serve to restrain the enemy and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to encourage the feeble and timid , even without counting the advantages gained from the satisfaction of having fulfilled a duty . Moreover , We are_not ready to admit that the zeal and activity of Catholics cannot attain their end if properly guided and with perseverance . For it ever has chanced and will happen that enterprises most surrounded with difficulties end happily , provided , as We have_said they_are carried_out with courageous energy , guided and aided by Christian prudence . And indeed truth , naturally desired by all men , will sooner or later win men s minds . Truth may be tried and oppressed by intellectual troubles and diseases , but it can_never be destroyed . All that_has gone before seems to apply in a special_way to Bavaria . For by God s grace , since it ranks among Catholic kingdoms , it must keep and nourish rather_than accept that Divine faith_which it received_from its forefather . Moreover , they_who in the people s name make laws to govern_the kingdom are mostly Catholics , as are_also many of its citizens and inhabitants , and therefore We doubt not they_will aid with_their utmost strength the Church , their mother , in her many trials . If all unite their_efforts as energetically and actively as they ought , there_will , by God s grace , be reason to rejoice -atti_degli_apostoli- the happy results of their zeal . We recommend to all such union , for as there_-isaia-_nothing so baneful as discord , there_-isaia- concord of spirit , when in united force they_are brought to bear for some common purpose . Effectively the laws give Catholics an easy way of seeking to amend the condition and order of the State and to desire and will a constitution which , if not favourable and well intentioned towards_the Church , shall -atti_degli_apostoli- least , as justice requires , be not harshly hostile . It would be unjust to accuse or blame any_one amongst us who_has recourse to such means , for those means , used by the enemies of Catholicity to obtain and to extort , as it were , from rulers laws inimical to civil and religious_freedom , may surely be used by Catholics in an honourable manner for the interests of religion and in defence of the property , privileges , and right divinely granted to the Catholic Church , and that ought to be respected with all honour by rulers and subjects alike . Of the rights of the Church that_it_-isaia- Our duty everywhere and always to maintain and defend against all injustice , the first -isaia- certainly that of enjoying the full freedom of action she may need in working for the salvation_of_souls . This -isaia- a divine liberty , having as its author the only Son of God , Who by shedding of blood , gave birth to the Church Who established it until the end of time , and chose Himself to be its Head . This liberty -isaia- so essential to the Church , a perfect and divine institution , that_they who attack this liberty -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time offend against God and their_duty . For as We have elsewhere more_than_once shown , God established His Church to protect and distribute what_-isaia- of supreme good to souls , by their nature superior to all others , and to bring men , by means of faith and grace , to a new_life in Jesus Christ , a life_that ensures eternal_salvation . Since the character and rights of any society are fixed by its reason_for existing and by the end it aims -atti_degli_apostoli- , in accordance_with_the terms of its existence , and conformably with its object , it naturally follows_that the Church -isaia- a society as distinct from civil_society as their reason_for existence and ends are different ; it follows_that she_-isaia- an indispensable society , for all mankind , since all are_called a Christian life , and so they_who refuse to enter it , or leave it are separated for ever from life eternal ; and it -isaia- a society eminently independent , and above all others , because of the excellence of the heavenly and immortal blessings towards which it tends . But an essentially free institution requires , as all may see , freedom to use the means necessary_for its operations . The Church therefore needs , as proper and necessary means , the power of handing down Christian doctrine , of giving the Sacraments , of exercising divine_worship , of regulating and ruling all ecclesiastical discipline , with_which gifts and offices God willed that His Church should be invested and strengthened , and by an admirable providence willed too that She alone should possess . To Her alone has He given in charge all He has revealed to men and established as sole interpreter , judge , and mistress , most wise and infallible , of the truth , whose precepts states as well as individuals must hear and accept . It -isaia- equally certain the He has_given the Church full freedom to judge and decide as to the things_that may best suit Her ends . Wherefore it -isaia- unjustly that the civil powers take offence -atti_degli_apostoli- the freedom of the Church , since_the principle of civil and religious power -isaia- one_and_the_same , namely , God . Therefore there_can be no discord between_them , nor mutual obstacles nor encroachments , for God cannot be -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with Himself , and there cannot be conflict between His works ; rather there_-isaia- between_them a marvellous harmony of causes and effects . It -isaia- clear likewise that_when the Catholic Church , obeying Her Master s will , carries far and wide her standard among nations , she does_not invade the territory of the civil_power , and interferes with it in no way , but , on the contrary , protects and guards those nations , just as the Christian law does_not cloud the light of human_reason but adds to its brilliancy by turning it aside from falsities into which human_nature easily falls , or in opening to it a newer and wider intellectual horizon . In regard to Bavaria arrangements were made between_the Holy See and that country , which_were ratified and made binding by reciprocal treaties . Although the Holy See granted great concessions in making a convention touching its rights , nevertheless in its wonted manner it has religiously kept the whole of these arrangements , and has_never done anything that might give rise to conflict . Wherefore it -isaia- earnestly to be hoped that_they_may be faithfully kept on both sides , not_only according to the letter , but according to the spirit in which_they were made . Once indeed this harmony was broken , but a decree of Maximiliam I restored it , and Maximilian II confirmed it in a fair and just manner by sanctioning some opportune modifications . These modifications have , however , We know , been lately abrogated . We , nevertheless , on account of the religious prudence of the prince who governs the kingdom of Bavaria , are confident that he who inherits the rank and faith of the Maximilians , will himself safeguard Catholic interests by removing obstacles that -baruc- their_way , and that he will favour their development . Consequently , the Catholics , who form the majority of the people , and whose love of country and respect_for authority are conspicuous , if they see_that in a matter of such moment , their desires are taken into_account and satisfied , will increase their love and respect_for a prince , as sons for their father , and , following his counsels for the welfare and honour of the kingdom , they_will fulfill them to the uttermost limits of their_power . Such , Venerable Brothers , -isaia- what_the duty of Our Apostolic office compels Us to say to you . It only remains to implore in common and with assurance , the help of God , and to this_end , let us take as Our intercessors , the ever Glorious Virgin Mary and the heavenly patrons of Bavaria , so that He may hear our united prayers and graciously grant to the Church peace and freedom , and that , thanks to Him , Bavaria may enjoy glory and prosperity daily increasing . As a promise of these heavenly favours , and in witness of Our special goodwill , We earnestly bestow on you , Venerable Brothers , to you , the clergy_and_people confided to your_care , the Apostolic Blessing .
