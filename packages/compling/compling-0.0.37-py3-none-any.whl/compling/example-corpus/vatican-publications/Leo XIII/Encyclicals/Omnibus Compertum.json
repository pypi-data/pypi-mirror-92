Everybody knows very well , venerable_brothers , that -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Our pontificate , We gave Our affectionate attention to the Christian peoples of the East . In addition , in several acts which We published , especially in the constitution Orientalium , We have_made many timely declarations designed to bind these peoples more_closely to the See of Peter and to encourage the reconciliation of dissidents . We have since found other occasions to show effectively Our good_will toward Eastern Catholics . Nothing has_been more precious , more sacred to Us than arousing the ardor and the richness of faith in those_who_are in communion with the Apostolic See so that_they strive to achieve the same glory and excellence by imitating the example of their ancestors . Previous Assistance for the Antiochene Greek Melchites . Among all the Eastern churches , We bestow , and have_always bestowed , a special affection on the illustrious nation and patriarchate of the Greek Melchites of Antioch . To recall only a few brief items , you_know very well that , in the year , We founded a seminary for the Greek Melchites in the city of Jerusalem and placed the White Fathers in charge . In addition -atti_degli_apostoli- Our own expense , We see to the education of many_young men of the same Greek Melchite nation -atti_degli_apostoli- the college of St . Athanasius in Rome that_they_may draw Catholic truth right from its_very source and become accustomed by its presence to honor and love the center of unity_which God has placed in the Apostolic See . Finally in , as can be seen in the same constitution Orientalium , We conferred on the Greek Melchite patriarch jurisdiction over all the faithful of the same rite who_live within_the borders of the Turkish empire . We are glad to state that the religious exertion of your Order has kept pace with the paternal good_will which We have shown toward_the Greek Melchite nation both by the zeal which_you show in fulfilling your ministry , called on as you_are to bear a portion of Our cares , and by the diligence with_which you provide_for the well_being of the flock entrusted_to_your care . But even_though the commemoration of all those matters involves the praise of your Order , We cannot , however , hide the sadness We felt when We learned that certain minor disagreements had recently risen among_you . With the favor and the help of God s grace , We have been_able to appease such a disagreement . For when_you came to Rome last month and complied with Our exhortations with a laudable docility , peace and harmony were immediately restored . Three Recommendations to Ensure Harmony . Now to consolidate this agreement , We think We should make three statements in particular in this_letter . Concerning the rights , privileges , duties , and prerogatives of the patriarch , We wish that_nothing be taken away from them nor be decreased ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time , We strongly ask Our venerable brother , the patriarch of Antioch , to show a fitting respect_for and to embrace with fraternal charity the bishops of his nation '' whom_the Holy Spirit has placed in charge of the Church of God , '' in conformity_with_the precept of St . Peter , the prince of the apostles : '' Be not as masters among your_people , but_from the heart become an example for the flock . That -isaia-_also what_the beautiful words of St . Bernard express : '' May love accomplish more_than power . We also remind all the bishops of the same nation that_they owe homage and deference to the patriarch We have praised . They should show him the submission that_-isaia- due him as their legitimate superior . If some controversy arises between_them , they_should humbly submit it first of all to the judgment of the patriarch . If it turns out that the question cannot be resolved , it should be respectfully referred to the Holy See . To prevent future contestations of rights , it would be most effective to convene a plenary Council . That -isaia- why , as We have_already recommended to you on other occasions , We prescribe it for you now by this_letter . The Council should be convened as soon as possible . The following matters should be discussed : the rights of the patriarch and of the bishops ; the correct administration of the faithful ; the discipline of the clergy , monastic orders , and other religious institutions ; the needs of missions ; the beauty of divine_worship ; the sacred_liturgy ; and other related matters which_should be considered with prudent care to ensure the greater glory of God and to increase the honor of the Greek Melchite church . As the other Eastern churches have drawn great profit from the meeting of their national council in arranging their affairs and in restoring ecclesiastical discipline , so We can rightly promise magnificent results for your church from the composition and promulgation of written laws . Now , before bringing this_letter to a close , We urge and beseech you from the bottom of Our heart that , linked more_closely by the bonds of charity as each_day passes , '' You strive with all humility and gentleness to preserve the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace . '' None of you -isaia- unaware of how_much harmony of spirit , heart , and opinion affects the good of the whole Church and assists in the reconciliation of dissidents . For this_reason , venerable_brothers , We have_the certain hope_that you will destroy the seeds of dissension -atti_degli_apostoli- their roots , deferring with gladness to these paternal admonitions , to these desires , to these demands which We formulate and thus complete Our joy and acquit yourselves of all aspects of your solemn duty for the perfection of the saints in the building up of the body of Christ . Be assured that Our fixed intention -isaia- to give every assistance which_can contribute to the greater good of the Greek Melchite Church . Meanwhile , in the humility of Our heart , We pray and beseech God to generously bestow His heavenly_gifts on you . As a sign of divine protection and as a testimony of the great love We have for you in the Lord , We very affectionately bestow Our apostolic_blessing on you_,_venerable_brothers , on all your_clergy , and on all the Greek Melchite faithful laity .
