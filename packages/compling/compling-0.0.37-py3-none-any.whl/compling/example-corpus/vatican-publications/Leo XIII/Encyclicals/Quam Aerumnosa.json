Venerable Brethren , Greeting and the Apostolic Blessing . How sad and fraught with trouble -isaia- the state of those_who yearly emigrate in bodies to America for the means of living -isaia- so well_known to you that_there_-isaia- no need of Us to speak of it -atti_degli_apostoli- length . For the evils which press about them are witnessed by you close -atti_degli_apostoli- hand , and more_than_once in your letters to Us , many of you_have mournfully referred to the matter . It -isaia- , indeed , piteous that so many unhappy sons of Italy , driven by want to seek another land , should encounter ills greater_than those from which they_would fly . And it often happens_that to the toils of every_kind by which their physical life_-isaia- wasted , -isaia- added the far more wretched ruin of their_souls . The very first voyage of the emigrants -isaia- full of perils and hardships , for they fall for the most part into the hands of avaricious traders , whose slaves they in a manner are , and thrown together by droves in the narrow spaces of the ships , with but slight clothing , they_are gradually driven into depraved habits . When they reach the lands for which_they_are destined , ignorant as they_are of the language and the place , and hired out for daily labour , they fall_into the hands of the dishonest , and into the snares of those more powerful men to whom_they enslave themselves . Even those_who by their industry are_able to provide the wherewithal of life by continually mixing with men_who value everything by profit and worldly advantage , they learn to toss aside by degrees the high aspirations of humanity and to live the life of those_who place all their hopes and desires upon this_world . Then the troubles of ambition are on all sides in their path , and the deceits of sects , which in these countries are widespread in their hostility to religion , pull down many into the path that points to ruin . Among all these evils , however_,_that -isaia- by far the most calamitous which , among so many men , and in so wide and difficult a country , renders it not as easy as it should be to obtain the saving assistance of God s servants who_are unable to speak to them the word of life in the Italian tongue , to administer the sacraments , or to uphold by the aids whereby_the soul -isaia- raised to the desire of heavenly things , and the life of the spirit_-isaia- strengthened and nourished . Hence in many places very few are consoled by a priest in death , and many are deprived of baptism -atti_degli_apostoli- birth ; and there_are_many whose marriage -isaia- not blessed by the lawful ceremonies of the Church , and hence a young generation -isaia- born like their fathers , and on every side by man s forgetfulness Christian morality -isaia- killed and all that_-isaia- most wicked grows rank . Considering these_things with care , and sorrowing over the wretchedness of somany men , whom We saw to be wandering like sheep on steep and difficult placeswithout a shepherd , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time calling to mind the charity andteaching of the Eternal Father , We considered it to be Our duty to hasten , withall the help in Our power , to prepare healthy pastures , and by every possibleexertion to advance their salvation and their good . And We did so with thegreater goodwill because the love for men_who spring from the same race asourselves makes Us more zealous for their benefit , and We had the certain hopethat your zeal and assistance would never be wanting to Us . Wherefore Weordained that in the Sacred Council of Propaganda this_matter should bediscussed , and We issued commands that_when the remedies had_been carefullyinquired into and well weighed , by means of which these evils might be crushed , or a least alleviated , the most opportune should be laid before Us , bothquestions being -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time carefully considered , namely , the salvation ofsouls and the lessening of the material distress of the emigrants as far aspossible . Moreover , as the principal cause of the growing ill lay in this , thatthese unhappy men were without_the help of a priestly_ministry by means of whichthe grace of heaven -isaia- given and increased , We determined to send from Italy tothat land many priests to console their countrymen in their_own tongue , to teachthe faith and the obligations of the Christian life_,_which were unknown orneglected , to administer to them the saving sacraments , to spread among therising generation religion and charity in fine to help all of every class , byword and work , and to assist them by all the duties of the priestly office . Andfor the fuller and more convenient accomplishment of this , We founded , by Ourletter of December th , last year , sealed by the seal of the Fisherman , theApostolic College of Priests in the Episcopal See of Placentia , under the careof the Venerable Brother John Baptist , Bishop of Placentia , in whichecclesiastics , stimulated by Christ s love , might be practiced in those dutiesand that discipline by which they_might well and worthily fulfil Christ smission among the scattered sons of Italy , and become fit dispensers of God s mysteries . Among the students of this college , which We wish to be considered a seminaryfor God s ministers for the assistance of Italians dwelling in America , Wedesire youths born of Italian parents even in your_country to be received , provided they_are_called and desire to fulfil the Lord s ministry , so that whenthey have_become priests they_may go forth , under your pastoral authority , tofulfil all the duties of the Apostolic ministry as far as there_-isaia- need_for it . Nor do We daubs that_these will be received by you with fatherly affection , andwill obtain the necessary faculties for the sacred_ministry to their countrymen , to exercise them under the instruction of the parish priest ; behold they come toyou as helpers , that , under the authority of each of you in whose diocese theyare working , they_may give their best aid in the holy warfare . In truth , in thebeginning their help will_not be so large as the needs of the occasion demand , nor will it be possible , from the numbers and necessities of the faithful , toappoint priests in separate remote districts for the cure of souls . Wherefore Weconsider it the wisest course that , in the dioceses where_the Italians are mostnumerous , there_should be communities of priests_who may go forth and journey inthe surrounding districts and arrange touring missions . But on what system or inwhat special places this_can be done , it will be for your prudence to decide . All these_things which We considered to be a duty of our Apostolic care We havecommanded to be made_known to you by this_letter . But if any_one of you shalllearn either by his_own instinct and judgment or from the united counsel ofbrethren anything in addition which We may do for the comfort and profit ofthese men , you will be doing a favour to Us if you make it known to the SacredCouncil of Propaganda . And from this work_which We have undertaken for the good of many souls deprived of every consolation of the Catholic religion , We promise the most abundant fruits , especially if , as We trust , We are assisted in its growth by the zeal and assistance of those of the faithful whose means equal their piety . Moreover , We pray to the good God Who wishes all to be saved and to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- the knowledge of truth , that He may look graciously upon those beginnings , and may give a successful increase ; and We very lovingly grant the Apostolic Blessing as a pledge of Our most devoted affection to you , Venerable Brethren , and to all the Clergy and Faithful whom_you rule .
