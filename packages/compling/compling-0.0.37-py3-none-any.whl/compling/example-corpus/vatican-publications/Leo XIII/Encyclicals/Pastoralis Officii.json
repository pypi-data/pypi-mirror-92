Mindful of your pastoral duty and moved by your love of neighbor , you wrote to me last year concerning the frequent practice among your_people of a private , individual contest called dueling . You indicate , not_without grief , that_even Catholics customarily engage in this type of combat . At the same_time your request that We , too , attempt to dissuade men from this manner of error . It -isaia- indeed a deadly error and not restricted to your_country , but has spread so far that practically no people can be found free_from the contagion of the evil . Hence , We praise your zeal . It -isaia- clearly known what Christian philosophy , certainly in agreement with natural reason , prescribes in this_matter ; nevertheless , because the vicious custom of dueling -isaia- being encouraged with greatest forgetfulness of Christian precepts , it will be expedient to briefly review these rules . Clearly , divine_law , both that_which_-isaia- known by the light of reason and that_which_-isaia- revealed in Sacred Scripture , strictly forbids anyone , outside of public cause , to kill or wound a man unless compelled to do so in self defense . Those , moreover , who provoke a private combat or accept one when challenged , deliberately and unnecessarily intend to take a life or -atti_degli_apostoli- least wound an adversary . Furthermore , divine_law prohibits anyone from risking his_life rashly , exposing himself to grave and evident danger when not constrained by duty or generous charity . In the very nature of the duel , there_-isaia- plainly blind temerity and contempt for life . There can be , therefore , no obscurity or doubt in anyone s mind that_those_who engage in battle privately and singly take upon themselves a double guilt , that of another s destruction and the deliberate risk of their_own lives . Finally , there_-isaia- hardly any pestilence more deadly to the discipline of civil_society and perversive to the just order of the state than_that license be given to citizens to defend their_own rights privately and singly and avenge their honor which_they believe has_been violated . Penalties for Dueling . The Church -isaia- the protectress and guardian not_only of truth , but_also of justice and honor , in the union of which public peace and order are held together ; therefore it has vehemently condemned and taken pains to punish with the gravest penalties possible those guilty of private combat . The constitutions of Our predecessor Alexander III , inserted in the books of canon_law , condemn and solemnly denounce these private disputes . The Council of Trent punishes with singular and severe penalties those_who engage in these contests or in any_way participate in them . Indeed , above all other punishments it brands these persons with disgrace ; expelled from the bosom of the Church , they_are judged unworthy of the honor of ecclesiastical burial if they die in the struggle . Our predecessor Benedict XIV in his constitution of November , , Detestabilem , explained in fuller detail the Tridentine sanctions . In most recent_times , Pius IX in his apostolic_letter , which opens with Apostolicae Sedis and reduces the number of latae sententiae censures , clearly declares that not_only those_who contend in the duel incur ecclesiastical penalties , but_also those_who a called patrinos , seconds , and likewise witnesses and accomplices . The wisdom of these regulations -isaia- more evident as one examines the absurd justification or excuses for the inhuman custom of dueling . The generally held argument that_this sort of struggle washes away , as it were , the stains that calumny or insult has brought upon the honor of citizens surely can deceive no one but a madman . Even if the challenger of a duel -isaia- the victor , all reasonable persons will admit that the outcome simply proves he -isaia- the better man in strength or in handling a weapon , not the better man in honor . But if he falls in the combat , does he not prove by the same token how absurd -isaia- this_way of protecting his honor ? Few there_are , we believe , who commit this crime deceived by erroneous opinion . It -isaia- , to be sure , the desire of revenge that impels passionate and arrogant men to seek satisfaction . God commands all men to love each_other in brotherly_love and forbids them to ever violate anyone ; he condemns revenge as a deadly sin and reserves to himself_the right of expiation . If people could restrain their passion and submit to God , they_would easily abandon the monstrous custom of dueling . Fear -isaia- not a just excuse for those_who accept the challenge of a duel . They are afraid that_they_will be publicly disgraced as cowards if they refuse . Now if the duties of mankind are measured by the false opinions of the multitude , not by the eternal norms of rectitude and justice , there_would be no natural distinction between honorable actions and disgraceful deeds . The pagan philosophers themselves both knew and taught that the fallacious judgments of the masses must be spurned by a courageous and steadfast man . It -isaia- rather a just and holy fear which prevents a man from committing murder and makes him solicitous of his_own safety and that of his_brothers . Truly , he who disdains the worthless judgments of the mob , who prefers to undergo the scourging of insults rather_than abandon duty in any matter , proves himself to be of a far greater and exalted spirit than he who rushes to arms when provoked by an affront . Yes , indeed , if he wants to be judged rightly , he -isaia-_the_one in whom solid virtue shines_forth . The fortitude -isaia- truly called virtue , and its companion -isaia- a glory , that_-isaia- neither counterfeit nor deceptive . Virtue in a good man exists in accordance_with reason , and unless virtue rests on the judgment of God s approval , all glory -isaia- vain . Lastly , the baseness of dueling -isaia- so evident , that in our_time , despite theapproval and patronage of many , legislators have felt bound to repress it bypublic authority and published penalties . What -isaia- so perverse and destructive inthis case -isaia- that the written laws for the most part are evaded in substance andin deed ; and this often happens with the knowledge and silence of those whoseduty it -isaia- to punish the guilty and see_to_it_that the laws are enforced . Thusit happens_that frequently duels are fought and go unpunished , mocking the law . Dueling Laws Apply to Military Too . Absurd , certainly , and unworthy of a sensible man_-isaia- the belief of those whothink that civilians are to be prevented from_these contests , yet recommend thatthey be permitted to the military because , they maintain , such experiencesharpens military valor . Now , in the first_place , honorable deeds anddisgraceful acts are essentially different ; in no way can they be changed totheir opposites by the different status of persons . Indeed , men in whatevercondition of life are equally bound by natural and divine_law . The reason , moreover , for_such a concession for the military would_have to be sought inpublic benefit which_could never be so great so as to silence thevoice of natural and divine_law . What about the obvious deficiency in thisrationale of public advantage ? Assuredly , the incentives to military courage aimat better preparing the state against the enemy . Can this be accomplished by thepractice of a custom that by its_very nature causes the death of one of theindividual parties of the country s defense whenever dissension arises among thesoldiers for_which , indeed , occasions are by no means rare ? . Finally , the new age which boasts of far excelling previous ages in a morecivilized culture and refinement of manners -isaia- wont to consider olderinstitutions of little value and too_often reject whatever differs from thecharacter of the new elegance . Why -isaia- it that in its great zeal forcivilization , it does_not repudiate the base remnants of an uncouth age andforeign barbarism that we know as the custom of dueling ? . It will be your duty , venerable_brothers , to impress diligently upon the minds of your_people these points which I have briefly touched upon , that_they not rashly follow false notions concerning dueling , nor allow themselves to be carried away by the judgments of shallow men . Take particular care that youth -atti_degli_apostoli- the right time understand_that the Church s position on dueling -isaia- in agreement with natural philosophy . Indeed , just as in other countries Catholics in the prime of youth voluntarily and faithfully refuse to endorse dishonorable associations , in like_manner , we are extending to Catholic youth the opportunity to make_the same agreement among_themselves and pledge that -atti_degli_apostoli- no time and under no condition will they engage in a duel . We humble pray God that he strengthen our_common efforts with divine_grace and that He kindly grant what We desire_for public welfare , for the integrity of morals and for Christian life . Affectionately in the Lord , we impart the Apostolic Blessing , Venerable Brothers , in protection of truly divine favors and as a witness of Our good_will . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- the See of St . Peter , September , , in the fourteenthyear of Our Pontificate .
