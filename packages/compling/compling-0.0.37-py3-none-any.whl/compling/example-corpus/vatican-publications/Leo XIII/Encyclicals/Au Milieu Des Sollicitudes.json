To the Bishops and Faithful of France Amid the cares of the universal Church We have many times , in the course of Our Pontificate , been pleased to testify Our affection for France and her noble people , and in one of Our Encyclicals , still within_the memory of all , We endeavored solemnly to express the innermost feelings of Our soul on this_subject . It -isaia- precisely this affection that_has caused Us to watch with deep interest and then to revolve in Our mind the succession of events , sometimes sad , sometimes consoling , which , of late years , has taken_place in your midst . Again , -atti_degli_apostoli- present , when contemplating the depths of the vast conspiracy that certain men_have formed for the annihilation of Christianity in France and the animosity with which_they pursue the realization of their design , trampling under foot the most elementary notions of liberty and justice for the sentiment of the greater part of the nation , and of respect_for the inalienable rights of the Catholic Church , how_can We but be stricken with deepest grief ? And when We behold , one after another , the dire consequences of these sinful attacks which conspire to ruin morals , religion , and even political interests , wisely understood , how express the bitterness that overwhelms Us and the apprehensions that beset Us ? . On the other_hand , We feel greatly consoled when We see this_same French people increasing its zeal and affection for the Holy See in proportion as that See -isaia- abandoned We should rather say warred with upon earth . Moved by deeply religious and patriotic sentiments , representatives of all the social classes have repeatedly come to Us from France , happy to aid the Church in her incessant needs and eager to ask us for light and counsel , so as to be sure_that amid present tribulations they_would in nowise deviate from the teachings of the Head of the Faithful . And We , in Our turn , either in writing or by word of mouth , have openly told Our sons what_they had a right to demand of their Father , and , far from discouraging them , we have strongly exhorted them to increase their love and efforts in defence of the Catholic faith and likewise of their native land : two duties of paramount importance , and from which , in this_life , no man can exempt himself . Now We deem it opportune , nay , even necessary , once_again to raise Our voice entreating still_more earnestly , We shall_not say Catholics only , but all upright and intelligent Frenchmen , utterly to disregard all germs of political strife in order to devote their_efforts solely to the pacification of their_country . All understand_the value of this pacification ; all continue to desire it more_and_more . And We who crave it more_than any_one , since We represent on earth the God of peace , urge by these present Letters all righteous souls , all generous hearts , to assist Us in making it stable and fruitful . First of all , let us take as a starting point a well_known truth admitted by all men_of_good sense and loudly proclaimed by the history of all peoples ; namely_,_that religion , and religion only , can create the social bond ; that it alone maintains the peace of a nation on a solid foundation , When different families , without giving up the rights_and_duties of domestic society , unite under the inspiration of nature , in order to constitute themselves members of another larger family circle called civil_society , their object -isaia-_not_only to find therein the means of providing for their material welfare , but , above all , to draw thence the boon of moral improvement . Otherwise society would rise but little above the level of an aggregation of beings devoid of reason , and whose whole_life would consist in the satisfaction of sensual instincts . Moreover , without this moral improvement it would be difficult to demonstrate that civil_society was an advantage rather_than a detriment to man , as man . Now , morality , in man , by the mere fact_that it should establish harmony among so many dissimilar rights_and_duties , since it enters as an element into every_human act , necessarily supposes God , and with God , religion , that sacred bond whose privilege -isaia- to unite , anteriorly to all other bonds , man to God . Indeed , the idea of morality signifies , above all , an order of dependence in regard to truth which_-isaia- the light of the mind ; in regard to good which_-isaia- the object of the will ; and without truth and good there_-isaia- no morality worthy of the name . And what_-isaia- the principal and essential truth , that_from which all truth_-isaia- derived ? It -isaia- God . What , therefore , -isaia- the supreme good from which all other good proceeds ? God . Finally , who_-isaia- the creator and guardian of our reason , our will , our whole being , as well as the end of our life ? God ; always God . Since , therefore , religion_-isaia- the interior and exterior expression of the dependence which , in justice , we owe to God , there follows a grave obligation . All citizens are_bound to unite in maintaining in the nation true religious sentiment , and to defend it in case of need , if ever , despite the protestations of nature and of history , an atheistical school should set about banishing God from society , thereby surely annihilating the moral sense even in the depths of the human conscience . Among men_who have_not lost all notion of integrity there_can exist no difference of opinion on this_point . In French Catholics the religious sentiment should be even deeper and more universal because_they have_the happiness of belonging to the true religion . If , indeed , religious beliefs were , always and everywhere , given as a basis of the morality of human actions and the existence of all well ordained society , it -isaia- evident_that the Catholic religion , by the mere fact that_it_-isaia- the true Church of Jesus Christ , possesses , more_than any_other , the efficacy required_for the regulation of life in society and in the individual . Would you_have a brilliant example of this ? France herself furnishes the same . In proportion as France progressed in the Christian faith she_was seen to rise gradually to the moral greatness which_she attained as a political and military power . To the natural generosity of her_heart Christian charity came and added an abundant source of new energy ; her wonderful activity received still greater impetus from contact_with_the light that guides and -isaia- the pledge of constancy , the Christian faith_,_which , by the hand of France , traced such glorious pages in the history of mankind . And even to day does_not her faith continue to add new glories to those of the past ? We behold France , inexhaustible in her genius and resources , multiplying works of charity -atti_degli_apostoli- home ; we admire her enterprises in foreign lands where , by means of her gold and the labors of her missionaries who work even -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of their blood , she simultaneously propagates her_own renown and the benefits of the Catholic religion . No Frenchman , whatever his convictions in other respects , would dare to renounce glory such as this , for to do so would be to deny his native land . Now the history of a nation reveals in an incontestable way the generating and preserving element of its moral greatness , and should this element ever be missing , neither a superabundance of gold nor even force of arms could save it from moral decadence and perhaps death . Who then but understands that_for all Frenchmen professing the Catholic religion the great anxiety should be to insure its preservation , and that_with all the more devotedness since in their midst the sects are making Christianity an object of implacable hostility . Therefore , on this ground , they_can afford neither indolence of action nor party divisions ; the one would bespeak cowardice unworthy of a Christian , the other would bring_about disastrous weakness . And now , before going any further , We must indicate a craftily circulated calumny making most odious imputations against Catholics , and even against the Holy See itself . It -isaia- maintained that that vigor of action inculcated in Catholics for the defence of their_faith has for a secret motive much less the safeguarding of their religious interests than the ambition of securing to the Church political domination over the State . Truly this_-isaia- the revival of a very ancient calumny , as its invention belongs to the first enemies of Christianity . Was it not first of all formulated against the adorable person of the Redeemer ? Yes , when He illuminated souls by His preaching and alleviated the corporal or spiritual sufferings of the unfortunate with the treasures of His divine bounty , he was accused of having political ends in view . '' We have found this man perverting our nation , and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar , and saying that_he_-isaia- Christ , the king . If thou release this man , thou are_not Caesar s friend . For whomsoever maketh himself a king , speaketh against Caesar . We have no king but Caesar . It was these threatening calumnies which drew from Pilate the sentence of death against Him whom he had repeatedly declared innocent . And the authors of these lies , or of others of equal strength , omitted nothing that_would aid their emissaries in propagating them far and wide ; and thus did St . Justin , martyr , rebuke the Jews of his time : '' Far from repenting when_you had learned of His resurrection from the dead , you sent to Jerusalem shrewdly chosen men to announce that a heresy and an impious sect had_been started by a certain seducer called Jesus of Galilee . In so audaciously defaming Christianity its enemies know well what_they did ; their plan was to raise against its propagation a formidable adversary , the Roman Empire . The calumny made headway ; and in their credulity the pagans called the first Christians '' useless creatures , dangerous citizens , factionists , enemies of the Empire and the Emperors . '' But in vain did the apologists of Christianity by their writings , and Christians by their splendid conduct , endeavor to demonstrate the absurdity and criminality of these qualifications : they_were not heeded . Their very name was equivalent to a declaration of war ; and Christians , by the mere fact of their being such , and for no other reason , were forced to choose between apostasy and martyrdom , being allowed no alternative . During the following centuries the same grievances and the same severity prevailed to a greater or less extent , whenever governments were unreasonably jealous of their_power and maliciously disposed against the Church . They never failed to call public attention to the pretended encroachment of the Church upon the State , in order to furnish the State with some apparent right to violently attack the Catholic religion . We have expressly recalled some features of the past that Catholics might not be dismayed by the present . Substantially the struggle -isaia- ever the same : Jesus Christ -isaia- always exposed to the contradictions of the world , and the same means are always used by modern enemies of Christianity , means old in principle and scarcely modified in form ; but the same means of defence are_also clearly indicated to Christians of the present_day by our apologists , our doctors and our martyrs . What they have_done it -isaia- incumbent upon us to do in our turn . Let us therefore place above all else the glory of God and of His Church ; let us work_for her with an assiduity -atti_degli_apostoli- once constant and effective , and leave all care of success to Jesus Christ , who tells us : '' In the world you shall_have distress : but have confidence , I have overcome the world . To attain this We have_already remarked that a great union -isaia- necessary , and if it -isaia- to be realized , it -isaia- indispensable that all preoccupation capable of diminishing its strength and efficacy must be abandoned . Here We intend alluding principally to the political differences among the French in regard to the actual republic a question We would treat with the clearness which_the gravity of the subject demands , beginning with the principles and descending thence to practical results . Various political governments have succeeded one_another in France during the last century , each having its_own distinctive form : the Empire , the Monarchy , and the Republic . By giving one s self up to abstractions , one could -atti_degli_apostoli- length conclude which_-isaia- the best of these forms , considered in themselves ; and in all truth it may be affirmed that_each of them -isaia- good , provided it lead straight to its end that_-isaia- to say , to the common_good for_which social authority_-isaia- constituted ; and finally , it may be added that , from a relative point_of_view , such and such a form of government may be preferable because of being better adapted to the character and customs of such or such a nation . In this order of speculative ideas , Catholics , like all other citizens , are free to prefer one form of government to another precisely_because no one of these social forms -isaia- , in itself , opposed to the principles of sound reason nor to the maxims of Christian doctrine . What amply justifies the wisdom of the Church -isaia- that in her relations with political powers she makes abstraction of the forms which differentiate them and treats with_them concerning the great religious interests of nations , knowing that hers -isaia-_the_duty to undertake their tutelage above all other interests . Our preceding Encyclicals have_already exposed these_principles , but it was nevertheless necessary to recall them_for the development of the subject which occupies us to day . In descending from the domain of abstractions to that of facts , we must beware of denying the principles just established : they remain fixed . However , becoming incarnated in facts , they_are clothed with a contingent character , determined by the centre in which their application -isaia- produced . Otherwise said , if every political form -isaia- good by itself and may be applied to the government of nations , the fact still remains that political power -isaia- not found in all nations under the same form ; each has its_own . This form springs from a combination of historical or national , though always human , circumstances which , in a nation , give rise to its traditional and even fundamental laws , and by these -isaia- determined the particular form of government , the basis of transmission of supreme power . It were useless to recall that all individuals are_bound to accept these governments and not to attempt their overthrow or a change in their form . Hence it -isaia- that the Church , the guardian of the truest and highest idea of political sovereignty , since she_has derived it from God , has_always condemned men_who rebelled against legitimate authority and disapproved their doctrines . And that too -atti_degli_apostoli- the very time_when the custodians of power used it against her , thereby depriving themselves of the strongest support given their authority and of efficacious means of obtaining from the people obedience to their laws . And apropos of this_subject , We cannot lay too great stress upon the precepts given to the first Christians by the Prince of the apostles in the midst of persecutions : '' Honor all men : love the brotherhood : fear God : honor the king '' ; and those of St . Paul : '' I desire , therefore , first of all , that supplications , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be made for all men : For kings and for all who_are in high station , that_we_may lead a quiet and peaceable life , in all piety and chastity . For this_-isaia- good and acceptable in the sight of God , our Saviour . However , here it must be carefully observed that whatever be the form of civil_power in a nation , it cannot be considered so definitive as to have_the right to remain immutable , even_though such were_the intention of those_who , in the beginning , determined it . Only the Church of Jesus Christ has been_able to preserve , and surely will preserve unto the consummation of time , her form of government . Founded by Him who_was , who_-isaia- , and who_will be forever , she_has received_from Him , since her very origin , all that_she requires for the pursuing of her_divine mission across the changeable ocean of human affairs . And , far from wishing to transform her essential constitution , she_has not the power even to relinquish the conditions of true liberty and sovereign independence with_which Providence has endowed her in the general interest of souls . But , in regard to purely human societies , it -isaia- an oft repeated historical fact_that time , that great transformer of all things here below , operates great changes in their political institutions . On some occasions it limits itself to modifying something in the form of the established government ; or , again , it will go so far as to substitute other_forms for the primitive ones forms totally different , even as regards the mode of transmitting sovereign power . And how are these political changes of which We speak produced ? They sometimes follow in the wake of violent crises , too_often of a bloody character , in the midst of which pre existing governments totally disappear ; then anarchy holds sway , and soon public order -isaia- shaken to its_very foundations and finally overthrown . From that_time onward a social need obtrudes itself upon the nation ; it must provide_for itself without delay . Is it not its privilege or , better still , its duty to defend itself against a state of affairs troubling it so deeply , and to re establish public peace in the tranquillity of order ? Now , this social need justifies the creation and the existence of new governments , whatever form they take ; since , in the hypothesis wherein we reason , these new governments are a requisite to public order , all public order being impossible without a government . Thence it follows_that , in similar junctures , all the novelty -isaia- limited to the political form of civil_power , or to its mode of transmission ; it in no wise affects the power considered in itself . This continues to be immutable and worthy of respect , as , considered in its_nature , it -isaia- constituted to provide_for the common_good , the supreme end which_gives human_society its origin . To put it otherwise , in all hypotheses , civil_power , considered as such , -isaia- from God , always from God : '' For there_-isaia- no power but_from God . Consequently , when new governments representing this immutable power are constituted , their acceptance -isaia-_not_only permissible but_even obligatory , being imposed by the need of the social good which_has made and which upholds them . This -isaia- all the more imperative because an insurrection stirs up hatred among citizens , provokes civil war , and may throw a nation into chaos and anarchy , and this_great duty of respect and dependence will endure as Tong as the exigencies of the common_good shall demand it , since_this good -isaia- , after God , the first sand last law in society . Thus the wisdom of the Church explains itself in the maintenance of her relations with the numerous governments which_have succeeded one_another in France in less_than a century , each change causing violent shocks . Such a line of conduct would be the surest and most salutary for all Frenchmen in their civil relations with the republic , which_-isaia- the actual government of their nation . Far be it from them to encourage the political dissensions which divide them ; all their_efforts should be combined to preserve and elevate the moral greatness of their native land . But a difficulty presents itself . '' This Republic , '' it -isaia- said , '' -isaia- animated by such anti Christian sentiments that honest men , Catholics particularly , could_not conscientiously accept it . '' This , more_than anything else , has_given rise to dissensions , and in fact aggravated them . These regrettable differences would_have been avoided if the very considerable distinction between constituted power and legislation had_been carefully kept in view . In so much does legislation differ from political power and its form , that under a system of government most excellent in form legislation could be detestable ; while quite the opposite under a regime most imperfect in form , might be found excellent legislation . It were an easy task to prove this_truth , history in hand , but_what would be the use ? All are convinced of it . And who , better_than the Church , -isaia- in position to know it she_who has striven to maintain habitual relations with all political governments ? Assuredly she , better_than any_other power , could tell the consolation or sorrow occasioned her by the laws of the various governments by which nations have_been ruled from the Roman Empire down to the present . If the distinction just established has its major importance , it -isaia- likewise manifestly reasonable : Legislation -isaia- the work of men invested with power , and who , in fact , govern_the nation ; therefore it follows_that , practically , the quality of the laws depends more upon the quality of these_men than upon the power . The laws will be good or bad accordingly as the minds of the legislators are imbued_with good or bad principles , and as they allow themselves to be guided by political prudence or by passion . That several years_ago different important acts of legislation in France proceeded from a tendency hostile to religion , and therefore to the interests of the nation , -isaia- admitted by all , and unfortunately confirmed by the evidence of facts . We Ourselves , in obedience to a sacred duty , made earnest appeals to him_who was then -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of the republic , but these tendencies continued to exist ; the evil grew , and it was_not surprising that the members of the French Episcopate chosen by the Holy Ghost to rule over their_respective illustrious churches should even quite recently have considered it an obligation publicly to express their grief concerning the condition of affairs in France in regard to the Catholic religion . Poor France ! God alone_can measure the abyss of evil into which_she will sink if this legislation , instead of improving , will stubbornly continue in a course which_must end in plucking from the minds and hearts of Frenchmen the religion which_has made them so great . And here -isaia- precisely_the ground on which , political dissensions aside , upright men should unite as one to combat , by all lawful and honest means , these progressive abuses of legislation . The respect due to constituted power cannot prohibit this : unlimited respect and obedience cannot be yielded to all legislative measures , of no matter what kind , enacted by this_same power . Let it not be forgotten that law_-isaia- a precept ordained according to reason and promulgated for the good of the community by those_who , for_this end , have_been entrusted with power . Accordingly , such points in legislation as are hostile to religion and to God should never be approved ; to the contrary , it -isaia- a duty to disapprove them . It was this_that St . Augustine , the great Bishop of Hippo , brought out so strongly in his eloquent reasoning : '' Sometimes the powerful ones of earth are good and fear God ; -atti_degli_apostoli- other times they fear Him not . Julian was an emperor unfaithful to God , an apostate , a pervert , an idolator . Christian soldiers served this faithless emperor , but as soon as there_was question of the cause of Jesus Christ they recognized only Him who_was in heaven . Julian commanded them to honor idols and offer them incense , but_they put God above the prince . However , when he made them form into ranks and march against a hostile nation , they obeyed instantly . They distinguished the eternal from the temporal master and still in view of the eternal Master they submitted to such a temporal master . We know_that , by a lamentable abuse of his reason , and still_more so of his_will , the atheist denies these_principles . But , in a word , atheism -isaia- so monstrous an error that it could never , be it said to the honor of humanity , annihilate in it the consciousness of God s claims and substitute them_with idolatry of the State . The principles_which should regulate our conduct towards God and towards human governments being thus defined , no unprejudiced man can censure French Catholics if , sparing themselves neither fatigue nor sacrifice , they labor to preserve a condition essential to their_country s salvation , one_which embodies so many glorious traditions registered by history , and which_every Frenchmen -isaia- in duty bound not to forget . Before closing Our Letter , We wish to touch upon two points bearing an affinity to each_other and which , because so closely connected_with religious interests , have stirred up some division among Catholics One of them -isaia- the Concordat , which for so many years has facilitated in France the harmony between_the government of the Church and that of the State . On the observance of this solemn , bi lateral compact , always faithfully kept by the Holy See , the enemies of the Catholic religion do not themselves agree . The more violent among_them desire its abolition , that the State may be entirely free to molest the Church of Jesus Christ On the contrary , others , being more astute , wish , or rather claim to wish , the preservation of the Concordat : not because_they agree that the State should fulfil toward_the Church the subscribed engagements , but solely that the State may be benefited by the concessions made by the Church ; as if one could , -atti_degli_apostoli- will , separate engagements entered into from concessions obtained , when both of these_things form a substantial part of one whole . For them the Concordat would amount to no more_than a chain forged to fetter the liberty of the Church , that holy liberty to which_she has a divine and inalienable right . Of these_two opinions which_will prevail ? We know not . We desired to recall them only to recommend Catholics not to provoke a secession by interfering in a matter with which_it_-isaia- the business of the Holy See to deal . We shall_not hold to the same language on another point , concerning the principle of the separation of the State and Church , which_-isaia- equivalent to the separation of human legislation from Christian and divine legislation . We do not care to interrupt Ourselves here in order to demonstrate the absurdity of such a separation ; each_one will understand for_himself . As soon as the State refuses to give to God what belongs to God , by a necessary consequence it refuses to give to citizens that to which , as men , they_have a right ; as , whether agreeable or not to accept , it cannot be denied that_man s rights spring from his duty toward God . Whence if follows_that the State , by missing in this connection the principal object of its institution , finally becomes false to itself by denying that_which_-isaia- the reason of its_own existence . These superior truths are so clearly proclaimed by the voice of even natural reason , that_they force themselves upon all who_are_not blinded by the violence of passion ; therefore Catholics cannot be too careful in defending themselves against such a separation . In fact , to wish_that the State would separate itself from the Church would be to wish , by a logical sequence , that the Church be reduced to the liberty of living according to the law common to all citizens . It -isaia- true_that in certain countries this state of affairs exists . It -isaia- a condition which , if it have numerous and serious inconveniences , also offers some advantages above all when , by a fortunate inconsistency , the legislator -isaia- inspired by Christian principles and , though these advantages cannot justify the false principle of separation nor authorize its defence , they nevertheless render worthy of toleration a situation which , practically , might be worse . But in France , a nation Catholic in her traditions and by the present faith of the great majority of her sons , the Church should_not be placed in the precarious position to which_she must submit among_other peoples ; and the better that Catholics understand_the aim of the enemies who desire this separation , the less will they favor it . To these enemies , and they_say it clearly enough , this separation means_that political legislation be entirely independent of religious legislation ; nay , more , that Power be absolutely indifferent to the interests of Christian society , that_-isaia- to say , of the Church ; in fact , that it deny her very existence . But they_make a reservation fomulated thus : As soon as the Church , utilizing the resources which common law accords to the least among Frenchmen , will , by redoubling her native activity , cause her work to prosper , then the State intervening , can and will put French Catholics outside the common law itself . In a word : the ideal of these_men would be a return to paganism : the State would recognize_the Church only_when it would be pleased to persecute her . We have explained , Venerable Brethren , in an abridged though clear way , some if not all the points upon which French Catholics and all intelligent men should be -atti_degli_apostoli- peace and unity , so as to remedy , in so far as still remains possible , the evils with_which France -isaia- afflicted , and to elevate its moral greatness . The points in question are : Religion and country , political power and legislation , the conduct to be observed in regard to this_power and legislation , the Concordat , the separation of Church and State . We cherish the hope and the confidence that the elucidation of these points will dissipate the prejudices of many honest , well meaning men , facilitate the pacification of minds , and thereby cement the union of all Catholics for the sustaining of the great cause of Christ , who loves the Franks . How consoling to Our heart to encourage you all in this_way and to behold you all responding with docility to Our appeal ! You , Venerable Brethren , by your authority and with the enlightened zeal for Church and Fatherland which so distinguishes you , will_give able support to this peace making work . We delight in the hope that_those_who are in power will appreciate Our words , which aim -atti_degli_apostoli- the happiness and prosperity of France . Meanwhile , as a pledge of Our paternal affection , we bestow upon you , Venerable Brethren , upon your_clergy and also upon all the Catholics of France , the apostolic_blessing . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , the th day of February , , in the fourteenth year of Our Pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : . ; Minutius Felix , In Octavio .
