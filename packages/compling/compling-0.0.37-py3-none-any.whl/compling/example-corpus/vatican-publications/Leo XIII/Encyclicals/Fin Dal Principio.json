Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . From the beginning of our Pontificate having gravely considered the serious conditions of society , we are_not slow to recognize , as one_of_the_most urgent duties of the Apostolic office , that of devoting a most special_care to the education of the clergy . We see in fact_that all our designs to bring_about a restoration of Christian life among our people , would be in vain if in the ecclesiastical state the sacerdotal spirit was_not preserved intact and vigorous . This we have_not ceased to do , as far as was possible to us , both with institutions and writings directed to that end . And now a particular solicitude regarding the clergy of Italy moves us , venerable_brethren , again to treat on this_subject of so great_importance . It -isaia- true , beautiful and continued testimonies have_been shown of learning , piety and zeal , among which_we_are glad to praise the alacrity with_which , seconding the impulse and direction of their bishops , they cooperate in that Catholic movement which_we_have so much -atti_degli_apostoli- heart . We cannot altogether , however , hide the preoccupation of our soul -atti_degli_apostoli- seeing for some time past a certain desire of innovation insinuating itself here and there , as regards the constitution as well as the multiform actions of the sacred_ministry . Now it -isaia- easy to foresee the grave consequences which we should_have to deplore if a speedy remedy were_not applied to this innovating tendency . Therefore , in order to preserve the Italian clergy from the pernicious influences of the times , we deem it opportune , venerable_brethren , to recall in this our letter , the true and invariable principles that should regulate ecclesiastical education and the entire sacred_ministry . The Catholic priesthood divine in its origin , supernatural in its essence , immutable in its character , -isaia- not an institution that_can accommodate itself with ease to human systems and opinions . A participation of the eternal priesthood of Jesus Christ , it must perpetuate even to the consummation of ages the same mission that the Eternal Father confided to His Incarnate Word : '' Sicut misit me Pater , et ego mitto vos . '' To work the eternal salvation_of_souls will_always be the great commandment of which it must_never fall short , as to faithfully fulfil it , it must_never cease to have_recourse to those supernatural aids and those divine rules of thought and of action which Jesus Christ gave His Apostles when He sent them throughout_the whole_world to convert the nations to the Gospel . Paul in his letters reminds us that the priest can_never be anything but the legate , the minister of Christ , the dispenser of His mysteries , and he represents him to us as dwelling in a high place , as a mediator between heaven and earth , to treat with God , about the supreme interests of the human_race , which are_those of everlasting life . The idea that holy books give us of the Christian priesthood , -isaia- that_it_-isaia- a supernatural institution superior to all those of earth , and as far separated_from them as the divine -isaia- from the human . This same high idea -isaia- clearly brought out by the works of the Fathers , the laws of the Roman Pontiffs , and the Bishops , by the decrees of the Councils , and by the unanimous teaching of the Doctors and of the Catholic schools . Above all , the tradition of the Church with one voice proclaims that the priest_-isaia- another Christ , and that the priesthood though exercised on earth merits to be numbered among the orders of heaven ; because_it_-isaia- given to them to administer things_that_are wholly celestial and upon them -isaia- conferred a power that God has not trusted even to the angels ; a power and ministry which regard the government of souls , and which_-isaia- the art of arts . Therefore , education , studies , customs , and whatever comprises the sacerdotal discipline have always_been considered by the Church as belonging entirely to herself , not merely distinct , but altogether separate from the ordinary rules of secular life . This distinction and separation must , therefore , remain unaltered , even in our_own times , and any tendency to accommodate or confound the ecclesiastical life and education with the secular life and education must be considered as reproved , not_only by the traditions of Christian ages , but by the apostolic doctrine itself and the ordinances of Jesus Christ . Certainly in the formation of the clergy and the sacerdotal ministry , it -isaia- reasonable that regard should be had to the varied conditions of the times . Therefore we are far from rejecting the idea of such changes as would render the work of the clergy still_more efficacious in the society in which_they live , and it -isaia- for that reason_that it has seemed necessary to us to promote among_them a more solid and finished culture , and to open a still wider field to their_ministry ; but every_other innovation which_could in any_way prejudice what_-isaia- essential to the priest must be regarded as altogether blameworthy . The priest_-isaia- above all constituted master , physician and shepherd of souls , and a guide to an end not enclosed within_the bounds of this present life . Now he can_never fully correspond if he -isaia- not well versed in the science of divine and sacred things , if he -isaia- not furnished with_that piety which_makes a man of God ; and if he does_not take every care to render his teachings valuable by the efficacy of his example , conformably to the admonition given to the sacred pastor by the Prince of the Apostles : '' Forma facti gregis ex animo . '' For those_who watch the times and the changeable condition of society , these_are the right and the greatest gifts that could shine in the Catholic priest , together_with_the principles of faith ; every_other quality natural and human would certainly be commendable , but would_not have with_regard to the sacerdotal office anything but secondary and relative importance . If , therefore , it -isaia- reasonable and just that the clergy should accommodate themselves as far as -isaia- permitted to the needs of the present age , it -isaia- still_more necessary_that the present depravity of the century should_not be yielded to , but strongly resisted ; and this while corresponding naturally to the high end of the priesthood , will_also render their_ministry still_more fruitful by increasing its dignity , and therefore gaining it respect . It -isaia- seen everywhere how the spirit of naturalism tends to penetrate every_part of the social body , even the most healthy ; a spirit_which fills the minds with pride and causes them to rebel against every authority ; depraves the heart and turns it after_the desire of earthly goods , neglecting those eternal . It -isaia- greatly to be feared that_some influence of this_spirit , so evil , and already so widely diffused , might insinuate itself even among ecclesiastics , particularly among_those of less experience . What sad effects would_not arise if that gravity of conduct which belongs to the priest , should be in any_way lessened ; if he should yield with lightness to the charm of every novelty ; if he should deport himself_with pretentious indocility towards his superiors ; if he should lose that weight and measure in discussion which_-isaia- so necessary , particularly in matters of faith_and_morals . Would it not be a still_more deplorable thing , causing as it would the ruin of Christian people , if he , in the sacred_ministry of the pulpit , should introduce language not conformable to his character of a preacher of the Gospel ? Moved by such considerations we feel it our_duty again and still_more warningly to recommend that above all things the Seminaries should with jealous care keep up a proper spirit with_regard ro the education of the mind as well as to that of the heart . They must_never lose sight of the fact that_they_are exclusively destined to prepare young_men not_for merely human offices , however praiseworthy and honorable , but_for that higher mission , which we lately spoke of , as ministers of Christ and dispensers of the mysteries of God . From such a reflection altogether supernatural , it will be easy , as we have_already said in our Encyclical to the clergy of France , dated September , , to draw precious rules , not merely for the correct education of clerics , but_also to remove far from the institutes in which_they_are educated , every danger , whether external or internal , or of a moral or religious order . With respect to the studies , in order_that the clergy should_not be strangers to the advancement of all good discipline , everything_that -isaia- truly useful or good_will be recognized in the new methods ; every_age can contribute to the knowledge of human learning . However , we desire_that on this_subject , great attention shall be paid to our prescriptions regarding the study of classic literature . , principally philosophy , theology , and the like sciences prescriptions which_we_have given in many writings , chiefly in the above mentioned Encyclical , of which we send you an extract , together_with_the present . It would certainly be desirable that the young ecclesiastics should all follow_the course of studies always under the shadow of the sacred institutes . However , as grave reasons sometimes render it necessary_that some of them should frequent the public universities , let it not be forgotten with what and how_great caution bishops should permit this . We desire likewise that_they_should insist on the faithful observance of the rules contained in a still more_recent document , which in a particular manner regards the lectures on anything else that could give occasion to the young_men to take_part in external agitations . Thus the students of the seminaries , treasuring up this_time , so precious and full of the greatest tranquillity for their_souls , will_be_able to devote_themselves entirely to those studies which_will render them fitted for the grand duties of the priesthood , particularly that of the ministry of preaching and the confessional . They should reflect well on the gravity of the responsibilities of those priests_who in spite of the great need of the Christian people neglect to devote_themselves to the exercise of the sacred_ministry , and of those also who , not bringing to it an enlightened zeal for both the one and the other , correspond sadly with their_vocation in things_which are of the greatest importance in the salvation_of_souls . Here we must call your attention , venerable_brethren , to the special instruction which we wish given regarding the ministry of the Divine Word ; and from which we desire they_should draw copious fruit . With respect to the ministry of the confession : let_them remember how severe are the words of the most enlightened and mildest of moralists towards those_who , without purifying their_own souls , do not_hesitate to seat themselves in the tribunal of Penance , and how not less severe -isaia- the lament of the late great Pontiff , Benedict XIV , who numbers among the greatest calamities of the Church the defect in confessors of a science , both theological and moral , added to the gravity that_such a holy office requires . To the noble end of preparing worthy ministers of the Lord , it -isaia- necessary , venerable_brethren , to watch with an ever_increasing vigor and vigilance not_only over the scientific instruction , but_also over the disciplinary and educative systems of your seminaries . Do not accept young_men other_than those_who exhibit well founded desires of consecrating themselves for ever to the ecclesiastical ministry . Keep them removed from contact and still_more from living together_with youths who_are_not aspiring to the sacred_ministry . Such intercourse may , for certain just and grave reasons , be allowed for a time , and with_great caution , until they_can be properly provided for according to the spirit of ecclesiastical discipline . Those who during the course of their education shall manifest tendencies little suited to the priestly vocation , must be dismissed , and in admitting clerics to the sacred orders the utmost discretion must be used , according to the grave admonition of St . Paul to Timothy , '' Manus cito nemini imposueris . '' In this_matter it -isaia- only right that_every consideration should be put on one side that_-isaia- inferior to the most important one of the dignity of the sacred_ministry . It -isaia- , therefore , of the greatest importance that in order to render the pupils of the sanctuary living images of Jesus Christ which_-isaia- the end of ecclesiastical education , that the directors and teachers should unite to the diligent fulfilment of their office the example of a truly priestly life . The exemplary conduct of those in authority_-isaia- , especially to young_men , the most eloquent and persuasive language to inspire in their_souls the conviction of their_own duties and the love of virtue . A work of such importance requires from the directors of souls a more_than ordinary prudence and an indefatigable care ; and it -isaia-_our desire_that this office , which we wish should_not be lacking in any seminary , should be confided to an ecclesiastic of great experience in the ways of Christian perfection . It can_never be sufficiently recommended to him to found and cultivate in his pupils that piety which_-isaia- for all , but especially_for the clergy , of the greatest fruitfulness and inestimable utility . Therefore , he will be solicitous to warn them against a pernicious snare not unfrequent among young_men that of giving themselves so entirely and with_such ardor to their studies as to neglect their advancement in the science of the saints . The deeper root piety has_taken in clerics souls , so much the more will they be filled_with that strong spirit of sacrifice which_-isaia- altogether necessary to work_for the divine glory in the salvation_of_souls . Thanks be to God , there_are not lacking among the Italian clergy priests_who give noble proof of what a minister of God , penetrated with_that spirit , can do ; wonderful , indeed , -isaia- the generosity of many who to spread the Kingdom of Jesus Christ voluntarily hasten to distant countries , there to encounter fatigues , privations and hardships of every_kind and even martyrdom itself . In this manner , aided by loving care and fitting culture of soul and mind , step by step the young Levite will be brought up to recognize both the sanctity of his vocation and the needs of the Christian people . The training , tis true , -isaia- not short ; and yet it -isaia- to be wished that the time in the seminary could be prolonged . It -isaia- necessary , indeed , that the young priests_are not left without guidance in their first labors , but should be strengthened by the experience of their seniors , who_will ripen their zeal , their prudence and their piety ; and it -isaia- expedient also_that either with academic exercises or with periodical conferences they_should be encouraged to continue with_their sacred studies . It -isaia- plain , venerable_brethren_,_that what_we_have here recommended will aid in a singular manner that social usefulness of the clergy which_we_have on many occasions inculcated as necessary to our_times . Therefore , by exacting the faithful observance of those rules this usefulness will draw therefrom its spirit and life . We repeat again , and still_more warmly , that the clergy go to a Christian people tempted on every side , and with every_kind of fallacious promise offered by Socialism to apostatize from the true faith . They must_therefore submit all their actions to the authority of those_whom the Holy Spirit has constituted Bishops , to rule_the Church of God , without_which would follow confusion and the most grave disorders to the detriment even of the cause they_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart to defend and promote . It -isaia- for_this end that we desire_that the candidates_for_the_priesthood , on the conclusion of their education in the seminary , should be suitably instructed in the pontifical documents relating to the social_question , and the Christian democracy , abstaining , however , as we have_already said , from taking any part whatever in the external movement . When they_are made priests they_will direct themselves_with particular care to the people , always the object of the Church s loving care . They will raise the children of the people from the ignorance of things both spiritual and eternal , and with industrious tenderness they_will lead_them to an honest and virtuous life . They will strengthen the adults in their_faith , dissipating the contrary prejudices and confirm them in the practices of Christian life . They will promote among the Catholic laity those institutions which_they all recognize as really efficacious in the moral and material improvement of the multitude . Above all they_will propose to them the principles of justice and evangelical charity , to which_are equally united all the rights_and_duties of civil and social_life , such should be the way_in_which they fulfil their noble part in the social action . Let them , however , have it always present to their_minds that the priest even in the midst of his_people must preserve intact his august character as a minister of God , being as he -isaia- placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of his brethren . Any manner whatever , in which he employs himself among the people , to the loss of the sacerdotal dignity , or with danger to the ecclesiastical duties and discipline , can_only be warmly reproved . This , then , venerable_brethren , -isaia- what_the conscience of the Apostolic Office has imposed on us to make known , regarding the present condition of the Italian clergy . We do not doubt_that in a thing of such gravity and importance you will add your zealous and loving care to our solicitude , inspired thereto especially by the bright example of the great Archbishop , St . Therefore , to give effect to our admonitions , make_them the subject of your diocesan conferences , and inform yourselves on such means as are necessary according to the needs of your respective diocese . To all these designs and deliberations you will_not lack the aid of our authority . And now , with words that rise from the depths of our fatherly heart , we turn to you , priests of Italy , and recommend to each and all of you to use every_effort to correspond still_more worthily with your high vocation . To you , ministers of Christ , we can say with more reason than did St . Paul to the mere faithful , '' Obsecro itaque vos ego vinctus in Domino , ut digne ambuletis vocatione qua vocati estis . '' The love of our_common mother the Church renews and reinvigorates between you that concord of thought and action which redoubles the strength and renders the work more fruitful . In these times , so dangerous to religion and society , when_the clergy of every nation are_called on to unite together in defense of the Faith and Christian morals , it belongs to you , beloved_sons , joined by a special bond to this Apostolic See , to give to all an example and be the first in unlimited obedience to the voice and command of the Vicar of Jesus Christ ; and so may the blessing of God Which we invoke descend copiously and preserve the Italian clergy ever worthy of their illustrious traditions . May the Apostolic Benediction be a pledge of the divine favor which , with the affection of our_heart , we impart to you and to the entire clergy trusted to your_care .
