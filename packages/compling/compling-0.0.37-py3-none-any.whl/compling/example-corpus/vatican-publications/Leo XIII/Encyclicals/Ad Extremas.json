Venerable Brothers , Health and Apostolic Benediction . The Orient , courageously and successfully explored by the Portuguese , -isaia- coveted by many today for its lucrative trade . We , however , have a more noble purpose in mind . We reflect upon those immense regions of the Indies where for_many centuries men of the Gospel have expended their labor . Our thoughts turn first of all to the blessed Apostle Thomas who_-isaia- rightly called the founder of preaching the Gospel to the Hindus . Then , there_-isaia- Francis Xavier , who long afterwards dedicated himself zealously to the same praiseworthy calling . Through his extraordinary perseverance , he converted hundreds of thousands of Hindus from the myths and vile superstitions of the Brahmans to the true religion . In the footsteps of this_holy man followed numerous priests , secular and religious , who with the authority and permission of the Holy See strove untiringly to preserve and promote the Christian mysteries and institutions introduced by Thomas and renewed by Xavier . To this_day , they_are continuing these noble efforts ; nevertheless , in the vast reaches of the earth , many are_still deprived of the truth , miserably imprisoned in the darkness of superstition ! How very great a field , especially in the north , lies yet uncultivated to receive the seed of the Gospel ! . Pondering these needs , We place our trust in Our Savior who alone knows the exact circumstance and time to bestow his light ; he -isaia- wont to direct the mind and hearts of men by divine inspiration . But , assuredly , We ought to exert every possible effort to convert such a great part_of_the_world . We have_been searching for possible ways of better organizing and expanding Christianity in the East Indies , we have decided upon certain measures to help achieve Our goal . First of all , to be sure , with_respect to the patronato of the Portuguese people in the East Indies , We have concluded a formal pact with the most faithful king of Portugal and Algerve . This agreement has removed the causes of dissensions , which_had disrupted Christians for so long a time . These communities have_been under obedience to apostolic vicars and prefects . We have decided to form them_into dioceses with_their own bishops to be administered by ordinary right . Therefore , by the apostolic_letter , Humanae salutis , given on the first of September , , a new hierarchy has_been instituted in those regions , consisting of eight church provinces , namely , Goa as the patriarchal see , Agra , Bombay , Verapoly , Calcutta , Madras , Pondichery and Colombo . Furthermore , through the Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith , We will do whatever will be fruitful there for salvation and for the increase of faith and piety . The preservation of the Christian faith among the Hindus will be precarious and its propagation uncertain as long as there_-isaia- not a native clergy properly trained for priestly duties , not_only to be of assistance to foreign priests , but_also to be in rightful charge of the administration of the Christian Church in their cities . Tradition tells us that Frances Xavier maintained this_same opinion . They say that he used to assert that the Christian cause in India could never have firm roots without_the continuing dedication of a pious and zealous clergy native to India . It -isaia- clearly evident_that he had a keen understanding of the issue . Certainly the work of the missionaries coming from Europe -isaia- beset with many obstacles . Most especially , indeed , -isaia- their unfamiliarity with the vernacular , which_-isaia- very difficult to learn . There -isaia-_also the remoteness of institutions and customs which remain unfamiliar even after a long period of time . Hence , the European clergy -isaia- forced to live there as in a strange land . Since a foreign clergy , therefore , has difficulty in winning the hearts of the people , it -isaia- plain that the work of a native clergy would be far more fruitful . From experience , they know_the nature and customs of their_people ; they know when to speak and when to keep silent . In fine , they live among Hindus as Hindus without causing any suspicion and it -isaia- , indeed , difficult to say how important this -isaia-_especially in times of crisis . Then , again , it -isaia- necessary to realize_that the number of missionaries abroad -isaia- far from adequate to serve the existing Christian communities . This deficiency -isaia- plainly evident from the mission statistics . The missionaries in India keep on imploring the Sacred Congregation for more preachers of the Gospel . Now , if there_are not_enough foreign priests to care_for souls , what will happen in the future when_the number of Christians will_have multiplied ? Nor , indeed , -isaia- there any reason to hope_that the number of missionaries will increase proportionately . Consequently , if we want to be concerned for the salvation of India and the establishment of Christianity in that immense region on a firm foundation , we will_have to select candidates from the native people , who after careful training will assume priestly functions and duties . Thirdly , we must_not overlook an eventuality , even_though -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time it -isaia- improbable . Such critical conditions could arise in Europe or Asia that_would compel foreign priests to leave the Indies . In that event , how could religion survive without a native clergy : with no one to administer the sacraments , no one to teach the law of God ? The history of the Chinese , Japanese , and Ethiopians speaks clearly enough about_this hazard . More than_once , the Christians in Japan and China had to suffer from hatred and calamity . The hostile people in power exiled and executed alien priests , but spared the native . Because they_were completely familiar with the language and customs of their native land and were sustained by friends and relatives , they_were allowed not_only to remain unharmed in their_country , but_also to administer the sacraments freely , and perform pastoral duties in all the provinces . On the contrary , the Ethiopia , where Christians already numbered , , a sudden storm of persecution completely destroyed the fruits of long labor because there_was no native clergy when_the European missionaries were killed or expelled . Finally , there_must be respect_for antiquity ; whatever we see advantageously established in times past must be religiously preserved . Now , it was_the practice of the Apostles first to instruct the multitude in Christian precepts , then to select several from the people and initiate them_into the sacred mysteries and even elevate them to the episcopacy . This example was followed afterwards by the Roman pontiffs . Their custom has_always_been to direct missionaries to exert every_means to select a native clergy wherever the Christian community grew sufficiently large . To take_care , therefore , of the preservation and propagation of the Catholic religion among the Hindus , a Hindu clergy has to be formed that could administer the sacraments and govern_the Christian people properly , no matter how menacing the times . For that_reason , the prefects of the Congregation of the Indies , with the advice and approval of the Holy See , have founded seminaries for priests wherever possible . The Synods , moreover , of Colombo , Bangalore and Allahabad , held -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of , have decreed that_every diocese should_have its_own seminary for the training of a native clergy ; if any of the suffragan bishops do not have_the financial means to do so , they_are to have_their seminarians trained in the metropolitan seminary -atti_degli_apostoli- their_own expense . The bishops are making every_effort to implement these beneficial decrees , but their most admirable willingness -isaia- hindered by lack of funds and by the want of qualified priests to supervise instruction and direct discipline judiciously . Hence , there_are hardly any seminaries where candidates are_able to complete a prescribed course of studies and this_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the civil government and Protestants , in large numbers , are sparing no expense nor effort to offer young_men a judicious and refined education . It -isaia- evident , therefore , how opportune it -isaia- and how consistent with the public good to erect in the East Indies some seminaries where_the native youth , the hope of the Church , are educated in all the refinements of doctrine and also in those virtues essential for the pious and wholesome exercise of sacred functions . As the reasons for dissensions have_been removed by the pact agreed upon , and as the diocesan administration had_been erected by the hierarchy of the Church , we would seem to have attained our goals if we could provide a sound basis for the training of the clergy . For , as We have_said , once seminaries for the clergy have_been founded , qualified priests in great numbers would come forth , and in spreading the truth of the Gospel , would skilfully utilize the important resources of their studies . Financial Contributions fitting_that Europeans make some financial contribution , especially because We alone are_not able to manage the vast cost of such an enterprise . It -isaia- the mark of Christians to cherish all mankind as brothers wherever they_are , and to exclude no one from their love , particularly in matters upon which_the eternal_salvation of their neighbour depends . We , therefore , earnestly request that_you will fully support our undertaking . Be sure_that the role of Christianity in such remote regions becomes well_known . Make your_people understand_that something must be done for the Hindus . May they_who believe_that works of mercy are the most perfect investment especially realize this need . We are convinced_that we have_not appealed in vain to the generosity of your_people . If the contributions should exceed the expenditures for the seminaries which_we_have mentioned above , we shall take_care that the remaining funds will be used beneficially and conscientiously on other projects . In token of heavenly favors , and as a witness of Our good_will , most lovingly in the Lord , We bestow upon you_,_venerable_brothers , upon your_clergy and your_people the Apostolic Blessing . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the th day of June , in the year , the sixteenth year of Our pontificate .
