Venerable Brethren , You know_how We place amid present dangers Our confidence in the Glorious Virginof the Holy Rosary , for the safety and prosperity of Christendom and the peaceand tranquillity of the Church . Mindful that in moments of great trial , pastors and people_have ever had recourse with entire confidence to the august Mother of God , in whose hands are all graces , certain too , that devotion to Our Lady of the Rosary -isaia- most opportune for the needs of these times , We have desired to revive everywhere this_devotion , and to spread it far and wide among the faithful of the world . Often times already We , in recommending the pious practice of devoting October to honouring Our Lady , have pointed_out Our reasons and hope_for so doing , and the forms to be observed ; and the entire Church , docile to Our desires , has_ever replied by special manifestations of devotion ; and now -isaia- making ready to pay to Mary , during a whole month , a daily tribute of thedevotion so dear to it . In such pious rivalry Italy has not_been behind hand , for devotion to Our Lady -isaia- deeply and widely rooted in this land ; and We doubt not that_this year too , Italy will set a glorious example of love for the august Mother of God , and will_give Us fresh reasons for consolation and hope . Nevertheless We cannot do less_than address to you , Venerable Brethren , a few words of exhortation , so that_with particular and renewed zeal the month dedicated to the Most Holy Virgin of the Rosary may be sanctified in every diocese of Italy . It -isaia- easy to imagine what reasons We have for doing this . Since God called Us to govern His Church on earth , We have sought to use every possible means_that We deemed suitable , for the sanctification of souls and the extension of the reign of Jesus Christ . We have excepted from Our daily solicitude no nationand no people , mindful that Our Redeemer shed His precious blood on the Cross and opened the reign of grace and of glory for all . None , however , can be surprised that We showed special_care for the Italian people , for Our Divine Master Jesus Christ chose , from out all the world , Italy to be the seat of His Vicar on earth , and in His providential designs appointed Rome to be the capitalof the Catholic world . On this account_the Italian people -isaia- called_upon to live close to the Father of the whole Christian family , and to share in a special_way in his sorrows and his glory . Unfortunately We find in Italy much to sadden Our souls . Faith and Christian morals , the precious inheritance be queathed by Our ancestors , and in all past rimes the glory of Our country and of Italy s great ones , are_being attacked artfully and in covert ways , or even openly , with cynicism that_-isaia- revolting , by a handful of men_who seek to rob others of that_faith and morality they_have themselves lost . In this more especially -isaia- seen the work of the sects , and of those_who_are more_or_less their willing tools . Above all , in this city of Rome , where Christ s Vicar has his See are their_efforts concentrated and their diabolical designs displayed with ferocious obstinacy . We need not tell you , Venerable Brethren , with what bitterness Our soul -isaia- filled -atti_degli_apostoli- seeing the danger there_-isaia- for the salvation of so many of Our beloved_children . And Our sorrow -isaia- greater because We find it impossible to oppose such_great evil with_that salutary efficacity We would desire and that We have_the right to use , for you_know , Venerable Brethren , and all the world knows , the state to which_we_are reduced . On this account We feel a still greater desire to call_upon the Mother of God and to ask her help . Let all good Italians pray_for their misguided brethren , for their common Father the Roman Pontiff , that God , in His infinite mercy , may hear and answer the prayers of a father and his sons . And Our most lively and sure hope -isaia- placed in the Queen of the Rosary , who_has shown herself , since she has_been invoked by that title , so ready to help the Church and Christian peoples in their necessities . Already have We recorded these glories and the great triumphs won over the Albigenses and other powerful enemies , glories and triumphs which_have not_only profited the Church , afflicted and persecuted , but_also the temporal welfare of peoples and nations . Why in this hour of need should We not behold again such marvels of the power and goodness of the august Virgin , for the good of the Church and its Head , and of the whole Christian world , if the faithful only revive , on their_part , the magnificent examples of piety given by their fore fathers , under similar circumstances ? And to make_this most powerful Queen more_and_more propitious , We would honour her more_and_more in the invocation of the Rosary , and increase this_devotion . And to this_end We have_made a double of the second class for all the Church of the Feast of the Rosary . And for the same purpose We ardently desire the Catholics of Italy , with lively faith , especially during_this month of October , to invoke this august Virgin and to do loving violence to her mother s heart , and to pray to her for the triumph of the Church and the Apostolic See , for the liberty of the Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth , and for peace and public prosperity . And since_the effects of such prayers will be proportionate to the dispositions of those offering them , We ardently exhort you_,_venerable_brethren , to devote all your_care and zeal to kindle among_those committed to your charge a strong , living , and active faith , and to call on all to return by penance to grace and to the faithful fulfilment of all their_duties . Among such duties , considering the state of the times , must be reckoned as paramount an open and sincere profession of the faith and teaching of Jesus Christ , casting aside all human respect , and considering before all things the interest of religion and the salvation_of_souls . It cannot be concealed that , although thanks to the mercy of God religious feeling -isaia- strong and widely spread among Italians , nevertheless by the evil influence of men and the times religious indifference -isaia- on the increase , and hence there_-isaia- a lessening of that respect and filial love for the Church which_was the glory of our ancestors and in which_they placed their highest ambition . Let it be your work , venerable_brethren , to revive this Christian feeling among your_people , an interest in the Catholic cause , a confidence in Our Lady s help , and a spirit of prayer . It -isaia- certain_that the august Queen , invoked thus well by her many sons , would deign to hear their prayer , console Us in Our sorrow , and crown Our efforts for the Church and for Italy , by granting better times to both . With these desires , We bestow on you_,_venerable_brethren , and the clergy_and_people committed to your_care , the Apostolic Benediction as a promise of graces and favours of the highest kind from heaven .
