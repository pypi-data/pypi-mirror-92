Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Looking back over the long space of time , which by God s Will We have passed in the Supreme Pontificate , We cannot_but acknowledge that , in spite of Our demerits , We have enjoyed the most singular protection of Divine Providence . This We believe must be attributed principally to the united , and therefore most efficacious , prayers , which , as of old for St . Peter , so now also_for Ourselves , are constantly being poured forth by the Universal Church . Wherefore We first of all give profound thanks to God , the Giver of all good things , and we shall continue as long as life lasts to cherish in mind_and_heart gratitude for each_and_every favour . And next , there comes to Our mind the sweet remembrance of the motherly protection of the august Queen of Heaven ; and this memory likewise We shall cherish and preserve inviolate , ever thanking her and proclaiming her benefits . From her , as from an abundant spring , are derived the streams of heavenly graces . '' In her hand are the treasures of the mercies of the Lord '' St . John Damascene , Sermon I . on the Nativity of the blessed Virgin . '' God wisheth her to be the beginning of all good things '' St . Irenaeus , Contra Valen . In the love of this tender mother , which We have constantly striven to cherish and to grow in day_by_day , We confidently hope_that We may end Our life . Summary of Preceding Encyclicals on the Rosary . We have long desired to secure the welfare of the human_race in an increase of devotion to the Blessed Virgin , as in apowerful citadel , and We have_never ceased to encourage the constant use of theRosary among Christians , by publishing every year since September , , anEncyclical Letter on this_subject , besides frequently issuing Decrees , as iswell known . And now , since God in His merciful Providence has this_year againallowed Us to see the approach of the month of October , which We have alreadyconsecrated to our Heavenly Queen under the title of the Rosary , We would notrefrain from again addressing you ; but summarizing in a few words all that wehave hitherto done for the promotion of his form of prayer , We will crown ourwork by yet a new document , in which Our earnest desire and zeal for_this formof devotion toMary may appear still more_clearly , and the fervour of the faithful may bestimulated to the devout and constant use of this pious practice . Impelled , therefore , by a constant desire_that Christians should ever beconvinced of the efficacy and dignity of the Rosary of Our Lady , We first of allpointed out that the origin of this form of prayer_-isaia- divine rather_than human , showing it to be an admirable garland woven from the Angelic Salutation , together_with_the Lord s Prayer , joined to meditation , and that_this form ofprayer was most powerful and particularly efficacious for attaining eternallife . For besides the special excellence of the prayers , it affords a powerfulprotection to faith and conspicuous models of virtue in the mysteries proposedfor contemplation . We showed also how easy the devotion -isaia- and how suited to thepeople , offering an absolutely perfect model of domestic life in meditation onthe Holy Family -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth , and that therefore Christendom had never failed toexperience its salutary effects . The Popes and the Rosary . For these reasons We have ever repeatedly encouraged the recitation of theHoly Rosary , and have endeavoured to increase its dignity by a more solemn cult , following in this_the footsteps of our_predecessors . , of happymemory , approved the ancient custom of reciting the Rosary ; Gregory XIII . dedicated a day under this title , which Clement VIII . afterwards inscribed inthe martyrology , and Clement XI . extended to the Universal Church . inserted the feast in the Roman Breviary , and We , ourselves , in perpetualtestimony of Our affection for this_devotion commanded that the solemnity withits office should be celebrated in the Universal Church as a double of thesecond class , consecrating to this_devotion the entire month of October . Finallywe ordered the addition to the Litany of Loreto of the invocation '' Queen ofthe most Holy Rosary , '' as an augury of victory in our present warfare . The Value of Indulgences . It remains to be added that great value and utility accrue to the Rosary fromthe abundance of privileges and favours which adorn it , and more particularlyfrom the rich treasures of indulgences attached to it . It -isaia- evident how greatlyto the advantage of all who_are solicitous for theireternal salvation -isaia- the obtaining of these benefits . For it -isaia-_a_question ofobtaining either totally or partially a remission of the debt of temporalpunishment which , even after guilt has_been forgiven , must be paid either inthis life or in the next . Vast indeed -isaia- the treasure won by the merits ofChrist , His Mother and the Saints , to which_our predecessor Clement VI . so aptlyapplied those words of the Book of Wisdom : '' She -isaia- an infinite treasure tomen : which_they that use become the friends of God '' Wisdom vii . The Roman Pontiffs , making use of that supreme power granted them by God , have opened out the most abundant fountains of these graces to the members ofthe sodality of the Holy rosary and to those_who recite the Rosary . Wherefore , believing that the Crown of Mary will shine more brilliantly withthese privileges and indulgences , as with an adornment of most_precious gems , Wehave decided upon carrying_out what We have long contemplated , namely , thepublication of a '' Constitution '' concerning the rights , privileges andindulgences which_are enjoyed by the members of the Rosary Sodality . This Our '' Constitution '' We intend to be a testimony of Our love to the mostaugust Mother of God , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time an encouragement to all the faithfuland a reward of their piety , so that in the last hour of life they_may be aidedby her assistance and sweetly rest in her embrace . This blessing We heartilyinvoke from Almighty God through the Queen of the most Holy Rosary , and as anearnest and pledge of Divine Blessings , Venerable Brethren , to your_clergy andto the people committed to your_care , We gladly impart the ApostolicBenediction . Peter s , in Rome , on the th day of September , , in the st year of Our Pontificate .
