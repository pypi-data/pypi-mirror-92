The only_begotten Son of the Eternal Father , who came on earth to bring salvation and the light of divine wisdom to men , conferred a great and wonderful blessing on the world when , about to ascend again into_heaven , He commanded the Apostles to go and teach all nations , and left the Church which He had founded to be the common and supreme teacher of the peoples . For men whom_the truth had set free were to be preserved by the truth ; nor would the fruits of heavenly doctrines by which salvation comes to men_have long remained had not the Lord Christ appointed an unfailing teaching_authority to train the minds to faith . And the Church built upon the promises of its_own divine Author , whose charity it imitated , so faithfully followed out His commands that_its constant aim and chief wish was this : to teach religion and contend forever against errors . To this_end assuredly have tended the incessant labors of individual bishops ; to this_end also the published laws and decrees of councils , and especially_the constant watchfulness of the Roman Pontiffs , to whom , as successors of the blessed Peter in the primacy of the Apostles , belongs the right and office of teaching and confirming their brethren in the faith . Since , then , according to the warning of the apostle , the minds of Christ s faithful_are apt to be deceived and the integrity of the faith to be corrupted among_men by philosophy and vain deceit , the supreme pastors of the Church have_always thought it their_duty to advance , by every_means in their_power , science truly so called , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to provide with special_care that all studies should accord with the Catholic faith , especially philosophy , on which a right interpretation of the other sciences in great part depends . Indeed , venerable_brethren , on this_very subject among others , We briefly admonished you in Our first encyclical_letter ; but now , both by reason of the gravity of the subject and the condition of the time , we are again compelled to speak to you on the mode of taking up the study of philosophy which shall respond most fitly to the excellence of faith , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time be consonant with the dignity of human science . Whoso turns his attention to the bitter strifes of these_days and seeks a reason_for the troubles that vex public_and_private life must come to the conclusion that a fruitful cause of the evils which now afflict , as well as those_which threaten , us lies in this : that false conclusions concerning divine and human things , which originated in the schools of philosophy , have now crept into all the orders of the State , and have_been accepted by the common consent of the masses . For , since_it_-isaia- in the very nature of man to follow_the guide of reason in his actions , if his intellect sins -atti_degli_apostoli- all his_will soon follows ; and thus it happens_that false opinions , whose seat -isaia- in the understanding , influence human actions and pervert them . Whereas , on the other_hand , if men be of sound mind and take their stand on true and solid principles , there_will result a vast amount of benefits for the public_and_private good . We do not , indeed , attribute such force and authority to philosophy as to esteem it equal to the task of combating and rooting out all errors ; for , when_the Christian religion was first constituted , it came upon earth to restore it to its primeval dignity by the admirable light_of_faith , diffused '' not by persuasive words of human wisdom , but in the manifestation of spirit and of power '' , so also -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time we look above all things to the powerful help of Almighty God to bring back to a right understanding the minds of man and dispel the darkness of error . But the natural helps with_which_the grace of the divine wisdom , strongly and sweetly disposing all things , has supplied the human_race are neither to be despised nor neglected , chief among which_-isaia- evidently the right use of philosophy . For , not in vain did God set the light of reason in the human mind ; and so far -isaia- the super added light_of_faith from extinguishing or lessening the power of the intelligence that it completes it rather , and by adding to its strength renders it capable of greater things . Therefore , Divine Providence itself requires that , in calling back the people to the paths of faith and salvation , advantage should be taken of human science also an approved and wise practice which history testifies was observed by the most illustrious Fathers of the Church . They , indeed , were wont neither to belittle nor undervalue the part that_reason had to play , as -isaia- summed up by the great Augustine when he attributes to this science '' that by which_the most wholesome faith_-isaia- begotten . -isaia- nourished , defended , and made strong . In the first_place , philosophy , if rightly made use of by the wise , in a certain way tends to smooth and fortify the road to true faith , and to prepare the souls of its disciples for the fit reception of revelation ; for_which reason it -isaia- well called by ancient writers sometimes a steppingstone to the Christian faith , sometimes the prelude and help of Christianity , sometimes the Gospel teacher . And , assuredly , the God of all goodness , in all that pertains to divine things , has not_only manifested by the light_of_faith those truths_which human intelligence could_not attain of itself , but others , also , not altogether unattainable by reason , that by the help of divine authority they_may be made_known to all -atti_degli_apostoli- once and without_any admixture of error . Hence it -isaia- that certain truths_which were either divinely proposed for belief , or were bound by the closest chains to the doctrine of faith , were discovered by pagan sages with nothing but their natural reason to guide them , were demonstrated and proved by becoming arguments . For , as the Apostle says , the invisible things of Him , from the creation of the world , are clearly seen , being understood by the things_that_are made : His eternal power also and divinity ; and the Gentiles who have_not the Law show , nevertheless , the work of the Law written in their_hearts . But it -isaia- most fitting to turn these truths , which_have_been discovered by the pagan sages even , to the use and purposes of revealed doctrine , in order to show that both human wisdom and the very testimony of our adversaries serve to support the Christian faith a method which_-isaia-_not of recent introduction , but of established use , and has often been adopted by the holy Fathers of the Church . What -isaia- more , those venerable men , the witnesses and guardians of religious traditions , recognize a certain form and figure of this in the action of the Hebrews , who , when about to depart out of Egypt , were commanded to take with_them the gold and silver vessels and precious robes of the Egyptians , that by a change of use the things might be dedicated to the service of the true God which_had formerly been_the instruments of ignoble and superstitious rites . Gregory of NeoCaesarea praises Origen expressly because , with singular dexterity , as one snatches weapons from the enemy , he turned to the defense of Christian wisdom and to the destruction of superstition many arguments drawn_from the writings of the pagans . And both Gregory of Nazianzen and Gregory of Nyssa praise and commend a like mode of disputation in Basil the Great ; while Jerome especially commends it in Quadratus , a disciple of the Apostles , in Aristides , Justin , Irenaeus , and very many_others . Augustine says : '' Do we not see Cyprian , that mildest of doctors and most blessed of martyrs , going out of Egypt laden with gold and silver and vestments ? And Lactantius , also and Victorinus , Optatus and Hilary ? And , not to speak of the living , how_many Greeks have_done likewise ? '' But if natural reason first sowed this rich field of doctrine before it was rendered fruitful by the power of Christ , it must assuredly become more prolific after_the grace of the Saviour has renewed and added to the native faculties of the human mind . And who_does_not see_that a plain and easy road -isaia- opened up to faith by such a method of philosophic study ? . But the advantage to be derived_from such a school of philosophy -isaia- not to be confined within these limits . The foolishness of those men_who '' by these good things_that_are seen could_not understand Him , that_-isaia- , neither by attending to the works could have acknowledged who was_the workman , '' -isaia- gravely reproved in the words of Divine Wisdom . In the first_place , then , this_great and noble fruit -isaia- gathered from human_reason , that it demonstrates that God -isaia- ; for the greatness of the beauty and of the creature the Creator of them may be seen so as to be known thereby . Again , it shows God to excel in the height of all perfections , especially in infinite wisdom before which nothing lies hidden , and in absolute justice which no depraved affection could possibly shake ; and that God , therefore , -isaia-_not_only true but truth itself , which_can neither deceive nor be deceived . Whence it clearly follows_that human_reason finds the fullest faith and authority united in the word of God . In like_manner , reason declares that the doctrine of the Gospel has even from its very_beginning been_made manifest by certain wonderful signs , the established proofs , as it were , of unshaken truth ; and that all , therefore , who set faith in the Gospel do not believe rashly as though following cunningly devised fables , but , by a most reasonable consent , subject their intelligence and judgment to an authority which_-isaia- divine . And of no less importance -isaia- it that_reason most clearly sets forth that the Church instituted by Christ as laid_down in the Vatican Council , on account of its wonderful spread , its marvellous sanctity , and its inexhaustible fecundity in all places , as well as of its Catholic unity and unshaken stability , -isaia- in itself a great and perpetual motive of belief and an irrefragable testimony of its_own divine mission . Its solid foundations having_been thus laid , a perpetual and varied service -isaia- further required of philosophy , in order_that sacred theology may receive and assume the nature , form , and genius of a true science . For in this , the most noble of studies , it -isaia- of the greatest necessity to bind together , as it were , in one_body the many and various parts of the heavenly doctrines , that , each being allotted to its_own proper place and derived_from its_own proper principles , the whole may join together in a complete union ; in order , in fine , that all and each part may be strengthened by its_own and the others invincible arguments . Nor -isaia- that more accurate or fuller knowledge of the things_that_are believed , and somewhat more lucid understanding , as far as it can go , of the very mysteries of faith_which Augustine and the other fathers commended and strove to reach , and which_the Vatican Council itself declared to be most fruitful , to be passed over in silence or belittled . Those will certainly more_fully and more_easily attain that knowledge and understanding who to integrity of life and love of faith join a mind rounded and finished by philosophic studies , as the same Vatican Council teaches_that the knowledge of such sacred dogmas ought to be sought as well from analogy of the things_that_are naturally known as from the connection of those mysteries one_with another and with the final end of man . Lastly , the duty of religiously defending the truths divinely delivered , and of resisting those_who dare oppose them , pertains to philosophic pursuits . Wherefore , it -isaia- the glory of philosophy to be esteemed as the bulwark of faith and the strong defense of religion . As Clement of Alexandria testifies , the doctrine of the Saviour -isaia- indeed perfect in itself and wanteth naught , since_it_-isaia- the power and wisdom of God . And the assistance of the Greek philosophy maketh not the truth more powerful ; but , inasmuch as it weakens the contrary arguments of the sophists and repels the veiled attacks against the truth , it has_been fitly called the hedge and fence of the vine . For , as the enemies of the Catholic name , when about to attack religion , are in the habit of borrowing their weapons from the arguments of philosophers , so the defenders of sacred science draw many arguments from the store of philosophy which_may serve to uphold revealed dogmas . Nor -isaia- the triumph of the Christian faith a small one in using human_reason to repel powerfully and speedily the attacks of its adversaries by the hostile arms which human_reason itself supplied . This species of religious strife St . Jerome , writing to Magnus , notices as having_been adopted by the Apostle of the Gentiles himself ; Paul , the leader of the Christian army and the invincible orator , battling for the cause of Christ , skillfully turns even a chance inscription into an argument for the faith ; for he had learned from the true David to wrest the sword from the hands of the enemy and to cut off the head of the boastful Goliath with_his own weapon . Moreover , the Church herself not_only urges , but_even commands , Christian teachers to seek help from philosophy . For , the fifth Lateran Council , after it had decided that '' every assertion contrary to the truth of revealed faith_-isaia- altogether false , for the reason_that it contradicts , however slightly , the truth , '' advises teachers of philosophy to pay close attention to the exposition of fallacious arguments ; since , as Augustine testifies , '' if reason -isaia- turned against the authority of sacred Scripture , no matter how specious it may seem , it errs in the likeness of truth ; for true it cannot be . But in order_that philosophy may be bound equal to the gathering of those precious fruits which_we_have indicated , it behooves it above all things never to turn aside from that path which_the Fathers have entered upon from a venerable antiquity , and which_the Vatican Council solemnly and authoritatively approved . As it -isaia- evident_that very many truths of the supernatural order which_are far beyond_the reach of the keenest intellect must be accepted , human_reason , conscious of its_own infirmity , dare not affect to itself too great powers , nor deny those truths , nor measure them by its_own standard , nor interpret them -atti_degli_apostoli- will ; but receive them , rather , with a full and humble faith , and esteem it the highest honor to be allowed to wait upon heavenly doctrines like a handmaid and attendant , and by God s goodness attain to them in any_way whatsoever . But in the case of such doctrines as the human intelligence may perceive , it -isaia- equally just that philosophy should make_use of its_own method , principles , and arguments not , indeed , in such fashion as to seem rashly to withdraw from the divine authority . But , since_it_-isaia- established that_those things_which become known by revelation have_the force of certain truth , and that_those things_which war against faith war equally against right_reason , the Catholic philosopher will know_that he violates -atti_degli_apostoli- once faith and the laws of reason if he accepts any conclusion which he understands to be opposed to revealed doctrine . We know_that there_are_some who , in their overestimate of the human faculties , maintain that as soon as man s intellect becomes subject to divine authority it falls from its native dignity , and hampered by the yoke of this species of slavery , -isaia- much retarded and hindered in its progress toward_the supreme truth and excellence . Such an idea -isaia- most false and deceptive , and its sole tendency -isaia- to induce foolish and ungrateful men wilfully to repudiate the most sublime truths , and reject the divine gift of faith , from which_the fountains of all good things flow out upon civil_society . For the human mind , being confined within certain limits , and those narrow enough , -isaia- exposed to many errors and -isaia- ignorant of many things ; whereas the Christian faith , reposing on the authority of God , -isaia- the unfailing mistress of truth , whom whoso followeth he will be neither enmeshed in the snares of error nor tossed hither and thither on the waves of fluctuating opinion . Those , therefore , who to the study of philosophy unite obedience to the Christian faith , are philosophizing in the best possible way ; for the splendor of the divine truths , received into the mind , helps the understanding , and not_only detracts in nowise from its dignity , but adds greatly to its nobility , keenness , and stability . For surely that_-isaia- a worthy and most useful exercise of reason when men give their_minds to disproving those things_which are repugnant to faith and proving the things_which conform to faith . In the first case they cut the ground from under the feet of error and expose the viciousness of the arguments on which error rests ; while in the second case they_make themselves masters of weighty reasons for the sound demonstration of truth and the satisfactory instruction of any reasonable person . Whoever denies that_such study and practice tend to add to the resources and expand the faculties of the mind must necessarily and absurdly hold that the mind gains nothing from discriminating between_the true and the false . Justly , therefore , does the Vatican Council commemorate in these_words the great benefits which faith_has conferred upon reason : Faith frees and saves reason from error , and endows it with manifold knowledge . A wise man , therefore , would_not accuse faith and look upon it as opposed to reason and natural truths , but would rather offer heartfelt thanks to God , and sincerely rejoice that , in the density of ignorance and in the flood tide of error , holy faith , like a friendly star , shines down upon his path and points_out to him the fair gate of truth beyond all danger of wandering . If , venerable_brethren , you open the history of philosophy , you will_find all We have just said proved by experience . The philosophers of old who lacked the gift of faith , yet were esteemed so wise , fell into many appalling errors . You know_how often among some truths they taught false and incongruous things ; what vague and doubtful opinions they held concerning the nature of the Divinity , the first origin of things , the government of the world , the divine knowledge of the future , the cause and principle of evil , the ultimate end of man , the eternal beatitude , concerning virtue and vice , and other matters , a true and certain knowledge of which_-isaia- most necessary to the human_race ; while , on the other_hand , the early Fathers and Doctors of the Church , who well understood that , according to the divine plan , the restorer of human science -isaia- Christ , who_-isaia- the power and the wisdom of God , and in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge , took up and investigated the books of the ancient philosophers , and compared their teachings with the doctrines of revelation , and , carefully sifting them , they cherished what_was true and wise in them and amended or rejected all else . For , as the all seeing God against the cruelty of tyrants raised up mighty martyrs to the defense of the Church , men prodigal of their great lives , in like_manner to false philosophers and heretics He opposed men of great wisdom , to defend , even by the aid of human_reason , the treasure of revealed truths . Thus , from the very first ages of the Church , the Catholic doctrine has encountered a multitude of most bitter adversaries , who , deriding the Christian dogmas and institutions , maintained that_there were many gods , that the material world never had a beginning or cause , and that the course of events was one of blind and fatal necessity , not regulated by the will of Divine Providence . But the learned men whom We call apologists speedily encountered these teachers of foolish doctrine and , under_the_guidance of faith , found arguments in human wisdom also to prove that_one God , who stands pre eminent in every_kind of perfection , -isaia- to be worshiped ; that all things were created from nothing by His omnipotent power ; that by His wisdom they flourish and serve each their_own special purposes . Justin Martyr claims the chief place . After having tried the most celebrated academies of the Greeks , he saw clearly , as he himself confesses , that he could only draw truths in their fullness from the doctrine of revelation . These he embraced with all the ardor of his_soul , purged of calumny , courageously and fully defended before the Roman emperors , and reconciled with_them not_a_few of the sayings of the Greek philosophers . Quadratus , also , and Aristides , Hermias , and Athenagoras stood nobly forth in that_time . Nor did Irenaeus , the invincible martyr and Bishop of Lyons , win less glory in the same cause when , forcibly refuting the perverse opinions of the Orientals , the work of the Gnostics , scattered broadcast over the territories of the Roman Empire , he explained according to Jerome the origin of each heresy and in what philosophic source it took its rise . But who knows not the disputations of Clement of Alexandria , which_the same Jerome thus honorably commemorates : '' What -isaia- there in them that_-isaia-_not learned , and what that_-isaia-_not of the very_heart of philosophy ? '' He himself , indeed , with marvellous versatility treated of many things of the greatest utility for preparing a history of philosophy , for the exercise of the dialectic art , and for showing the agreement between reason and faith . After him came Origen , who graced the chair of the school of Alexandria , and was most learned in the teachings of the Greeks and Orientals . He published many volumes , involving great labor , which_were wonderfully adapted to explain the divine writings and illustrate the sacred dogmas ; which , though , as they now stand , not altogether free_from error , contain nevertheless a wealth of knowledge tending to the growth and advance of natural truths . Tertullian opposes heretics with the authority of the sacred writings ; with the philosophers he changes his fence and disputes philosophically ; but so learnedly and accurately did he confute them that he made bold to say : '' Neither in science nor in schooling are we equals , as you imagine . '' Arnobius , also , in his works against the pagans , and Lactantius in the divine Institutions especially , with equal eloquence and strength strenuously strive to move men to accept the dogmas and precepts of Catholic wisdom , not by philosophic juggling , after_the fashion of the Academicians , but vanquishing them partly by their_own arms , and partly by arguments drawn_from the mutual contentions of the philosophers . But the writings on the human soul , the divine attributes , and other questions of mighty moment which_the great Athanasius and Chrysostom , the prince of orators , have left behind them are , by common consent , so supremely excellent that it seems scarcely anything could be added to their subtlety and fulness . And , not to cover too wide a range , we add to the number of the great men of whom mention has been_made the names of Basil the Great and of the two Gregories , who , on going forth_from Athens , that home of all learning , thoroughly equipped with all the harness of philosophy , turned the wealth of knowledge which_each had gathered up in a course of zealous study to the work of refuting heretics and preparing Christians . But Augustine would seem to have wrested the palm from all . Of a most powerful genius and thoroughly saturated with sacred and profane learning , with the loftiest faith and with equal knowledge , he combated most vigorously all the errors of his age . What topic of philosophy did he not investigate ? What region of it did he not diligently explore , either in expounding the loftiest mysteries of the faith to the faithful , or defending them against the full onslaught of adversaries , or again when , in demolishing the fables of the Academicians or the Manichaeans , he laid the safe foundations and sure structure of human science , or followed up the reason , origin , and causes of the evils that afflict man ? How subtly he reasoned on the angels , the soul , the human mind , the will and free choice , on religion and the life of the blessed , on time and eternity , and even on the very nature of changeable bodies . Afterwards , in the East , John Damascene , treading in the footsteps of Basil and of Gregory of Nazianzen , and in the West , Boethius and Anselm following the doctrines of Augustine , added largely to the patrimony of philosophy . Later on , the doctors of the middle ages , who are_called Scholastics , addressed themselves to a great work that of diligently collecting , and sifting , and storing up , as it were , in one place , for the use and convenience of posterity the rich and fertile harvests of Christian learning scattered abroad in the voluminous works of the holy Fathers . And with_regard , venerable_brethren , to the origin , drift , and excellence of this scholastic learning , it may be well here to speak more_fully in the words of one of the wisest of Our predecessors , Sixtus V : '' By the divine favor of Him who alone gives the spirit of science wisdom , and understanding , and who thou ages , as there_may be need , enriches His Church with new blessings and strengthens it with safeguards , there_was founded by Our fathers , men of eminent wisdom , the scholastic theology , which two glorious doctors in particular angelic St . Thomas and the seraphic St . Bonaventure , illustrious teachers of this faculty , . with surpassing genius , by unwearied diligence , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of long labors and vigils , set in order and beautified , and when skilfuly arranged and clearly explained in a variety of ways , handed_down to posterity . '' And , indeed , the knowledge and use of so salutary a science , which flows from the fertilizing founts of the sacred writings , the sovereign Pontiffs , the holy Fathers and the councils , must_always be of the greatest assistance to the Church , whether with the view of really and soundly understanding and interpreting the Scriptures , or more safely and to better purpose reading and explaining the Fathers , or for exposing and refuting the various errors and heresies ; and in these late days , when those dangerous times described by the Apostle are_already upon us , when_the blasphemers , the proud , and the seducers go from bad to worse , erring themselves and causing others to err , there_-isaia- surely a very great need of confirming the dogmas of Catholic faith and confuting heresies . Although these_words seem to bear reference solely to Scholastic theology , nevertheless they_may plainly be accepted as equally true of philosophy and its praises . For , the noble endowments which_make the Scholastic theology so formidable to the enemies of truth to wit , as the same Pontiff adds , '' that ready and close coherence of cause and effect , that order and array as of a disciplined army in battle , those clear definitions and distinctions , that strength of argument and those keen discussions , by which light -isaia- distinguished from darkness , the true from the false , expose and strip naked , as it were , the falsehoods of heretics wrapped around by a cloud of subterfuges and fallacies '' those noble and admirable endowments , We say , are only to be found in a right use of that philosophy which_the Scholastic teachers have_been accustomed carefully and prudently to make_use of even in theological disputations . Moreover , since_it_-isaia- the proper and special office of the Scholastic theologians to bind together by the fastest chain human and divine science , surely the theology in which_they excelled would_not have gained such honor and commendation among_men if they_had made use of a lame and imperfect or vain philosophy . Among the Scholastic Doctors , the chief and master of all towers Thomas Aquinas , who , as Cajetan observes , because '' he most venerated the ancient doctors of the Church , in a certain way seems to have inherited the intellect of all . '' The doctrines of those illustrious men , like the scattered members of a body , Thomas collected together and cemented , distributed in wonderful order , and so increased with important additions that_he_-isaia- rightly and deservedly esteemed the special bulwark and glory of the Catholic faith . With his_spirit -atti_degli_apostoli- once humble and swift , his memory ready and tenacious , his_life spotless throughout , a lover of truth for its_own sake , richly endowed_with human and divine science , like the sun he heated the world with the warmth of his virtues and filled it with the splendor of his_teaching . Philosophy has no part which he did_not touch finely -atti_degli_apostoli- once and thoroughly ; on the laws of reasoning , on God and incorporeal substances , on man and other sensible things , on human actions and their principles , he reasoned in such a manner that in him there_-isaia- wanting neither a full array of questions , nor an apt disposal of the various parts , nor the best method of proceeding , nor soundness of principles or strength of argument , nor clearness and elegance of style , nor a facility for explaining what_-isaia- abstruse . Moreover , the Angelic Doctor pushed his philosophic inquiry into the reasons and principles of things , which because_they_are most comprehensive and contain in their bosom , so to say , the seeds of almost infinite truths , were to be unfolded in good time by later masters and with a goodly yield . And as he also used this philosophic method in the refutation of error , he won this title to distinction for_himself : that , single handed , he victoriously combated the errors of former times , and supplied invincible arms to put those to rout which might in after times spring up . Again , clearly distinguishing , as -isaia- fitting , reason from faith , while happily associating the one_with the other , he both preserved the rights and had regard_for the dignity of each ; so much so , indeed , that_reason , borne on the wings of Thomas to its human height , can scarcely rise higher , while faith could scarcely expect more or stronger aids from reason than those_which she has_already obtained through Thomas . For these reasons most learned men , in former ages especially , of the highest repute in theology and philosophy , after mastering with infinite pains the immortal works of Thomas , gave themselves up not_so_much to be instructed in his angelic wisdom as to be nourished upon it . It -isaia- known that nearly all the founders and lawgivers of the religious_orders commanded their members to study and religiously adhere to the teachings of St . Thomas , fearful least any of them should swerve even in the slightest degree from the footsteps of so great a man . To say nothing of the family of St . Dominic , which rightly claims this_great teacher for its_own glory , the statutes of the Benedictines , the Carmelites , the Augustinians , the Society of Jesus , and many_others all testify that_they_are bound by this_law . And , here , how pleasantly one s thoughts fly back to those celebrated schools and universities which flourished of old in Europe to Paris , Salamanca , Alcal\u00e1 , to Douay , Toulouse , and Louvain , to Padua and Bologna , to Naples and Coimbra , and to many another ! All know_how the fame of these seats of learning grew with_their years , and that_their judgment , often asked in matters of grave moment , held great weight everywhere . And we know_how in those great homes of human wisdom , as in his_own kingdom , Thomas reigned supreme ; and that the minds of all , of teachers as well as of taught , rested in wonderful harmony under the shield and authority of the Angelic Doctor . But , furthermore , Our predecessors in the Roman pontificate have celebrated the wisdom of Thomas Aquinas by exceptional tributes of praise and the most ample testimonials . Clement VI in the bull In Ordine ; Nicholas V in his brief to the friars of the Order of Preachers , ; Benedict XIII in the bull Pretiosus , and others bear_witness that the universal Church borrows lustre from his admirable teaching ; while St . Pius V declares in the bull Mirabilis that heresies , confounded and convicted by the same teaching , were dissipated , and the whole_world daily freed from fatal errors ; others , such as Clement XII in the bull Verbo Dei , affirm that_most fruitful blessings have spread abroad from his writings over the whole Church , and that_he_-isaia- worthy of the honor which_-isaia- bestowed on the greatest Doctors of the Church , on Gregory and Ambrose , Augustine and Jerome ; while others have_not hesitated to propose St . Thomas for the exemplar and master of the universities and great centers of learning whom_they may follow with unfaltering feet . On which point the words of Blessed Urban V to the University of Toulouse are worthy of recall : '' It -isaia-_our will , which We hereby enjoin upon you , that ye follow_the teaching of Blessed Thomas as the true and Catholic doctrine and that ye labor with all your force to profit by the same . '' Innocent XII , followed the example of Urban in the case of the University of Louvain , in the letter in the form of a brief addressed to that university on February , , and Benedict XIV in the letter in the form of a brief addressed on August , , to the Dionysian College in Granada ; while to these judgments of great Pontiffs on Thomas Aquinas comes the crowning testimony of Innocent VI : '' His teaching above that of others , the canonical writings alone excepted , enjoys such a precision of language , an order of matters , a truth of conclusions , that_those_who hold to it are never found swerving from the path of truth , and he who dare assail it will_always be suspected of error . The ecumenical councils , also , where blossoms the flower of all earthly wisdom , have always_been careful to hold Thomas Aquinas in singular honor . In the Councils of Lyons , Vienna , Florence , and the Vatican one might almost say that Thomas took part and presided over the deliberations and decrees of the Fathers , contending against the errors of the Greeks , of heretics and rationalists , with invincible force and with the happiest results . But the chief and special glory of Thomas , one which_he_has shared with none of the Catholic Doctors , -isaia- that the Fathers of Trent made it part of the order of conclave to lay upon the altar , together_with sacred Scripture and the decrees of the supreme Pontiffs , the Summa of Thomas Aquinas , whence to seek counsel , reason , and inspiration . A last triumph was reserved for_this incomparable man namely , to compel the homage , praise , and admiration of even the very enemies of the Catholic name . For it has come to light that_there were_not lacking among the leaders of heretical sects some who openly declared that , if the teaching of Thomas Aquinas were only taken away , they could easily battle with all Catholic teachers , gain the victory , and abolish the Church . A vain hope , indeed , but no vain testimony . Therefore , venerable_brethren , as often as We contemplate the good , the force , and the singular advantages to be derived_from his philosophic discipline which Our Fathers so dearly loved . We think it hazardous that_its special honor should not_always and everywhere remain , especially_when it -isaia- established that daily experience , and the judgment of the greatest men , and , to crown all , the voice of the Church , have favored the Scholastic philosophy . Moreover , to the old teaching a novel system of philosophy has succeeded here and there , in which We fail to perceive those desirable and wholesome fruits which_the Church and civil_society itself would prefer . For it pleased the struggling innovators of the sixteenth century to philosophize without_any respect_for faith , the power of inventing in accordance_with his_own pleasure and bent being asked and given in turn by each_one . Hence , it was natural that systems of philosophy multiplied beyond measure , and conclusions differing and clashing one_with another arose about those matters even which_are the most important in human knowledge . From a mass of conclusions men often come to wavering and doubt ; and who knows not how easily the mind slips from doubt to error ? But , as men_are apt to follow_the lead given them , this_new pursuit seems to have caught the souls of certain Catholic philosophers , who , throwing aside the patrimony of ancient wisdom , chose rather to build up a new edifice than to strengthen and complete the old by aid of the new ill advisedly , in sooth , and not_without detriment to the sciences . For , a multiform system of this_kind , which depends on the authority and choice of any professor , has a foundation open to change , and consequently gives us a philosophy not firm , and stable , and robust like that of old , but tottering and feeble . And if , perchance , it sometimes finds itself scarcely equal to sustain the shock of its foes , it should recognize_that the cause and the blame lie in itself . In saying this We have no intention of discountenancing the learned and able men_who bring their industry and erudition , and , what_-isaia- more , the wealth of new discoveries , to the service of philosophy ; for , of course , We understand_that this tends to the development of learning . But one_should be very careful lest all or his chief labor be exhausted in these pursuits and in mere erudition . And the same thing -isaia- true of sacred theology , which , indeed , may be assisted and illustrated by all kinds of erudition , though it -isaia- absolutely necessary to approach it in the grave manner of the Scholastics , in order_that , the forces of revelation and reason being united in it , it may continue to be '' the invincible bulwark of the faith . With wise forethought , therefore , not_a_few of the advocates of philosophic studies , when turning their_minds recently to the practical reform of philosophy , aimed and aim -atti_degli_apostoli- restoring the renowned teaching of Thomas Aquinas and winning it back to its ancient beauty . We have learned with_great joy that_many members of your order , venerable_brethren , have_taken this plan to heart ; and while We earnestly commend their_efforts , We exhort them to hold fast to their purpose , and remind each and all of you that Our first and most cherished idea -isaia- that you_should all furnish to studious youth a generous and copious supply of those purest streams of wisdom flowing inexhaustibly from the precious fountainhead of the Angelic Doctor . Many are the reasons why We are so desirous of this . In the first_place , then , since in the tempest that_-isaia- on us the Christian faith_-isaia- being constantly assailed by the machinations and craft of a certain false wisdom , all youths , but especially_those who_are the growing hope of the Church , should be nourished on the strong and robust food of doctrine , that so , mighty in strength and armed -atti_degli_apostoli- all points , they may_become habituated to advance the cause of religion with force and judgment , '' being ready always , according to the apostolic counsel , to satisfy every_one that asketh you a reason of that hope which_-isaia- in you , '' and that_they_may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to convince the gainsayers . '' Many of those_who , with minds alienated from the faith , hate Catholic institutions , claim reason as their sole mistress and guide . Now , We think_that , apart_from the supernatural help of God , nothing_-isaia- better calculated to heal those minds and to bring them_into favor with the Catholic faith than the solid doctrine of the Fathers and the Scholastics , who so clearly and forcibly demonstrate the firm foundations of the faith , its divine origin , its certain truth , the arguments that sustain it , the benefits it has conferred on the human_race , and its perfect accord with reason , in a manner to satisfy completely minds open to persuasion , however unwilling and repugnant . Domestic and civil_society even , which , as all see , -isaia- exposed to great danger from this plague of perverse opinions , would certainly enjoy a far more peaceful and secure existence if a more wholesome doctrine were taught in the universities and high schools one more in conformity_with_the teaching of the Church , such as -isaia- contained in the works of Thomas Aquinas . For , the teachings of Thomas on the true meaning of liberty , which -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time -isaia- running into license , on the divine origin of all authority , on laws and their force , on the paternal and just rule of princes , on obedience to the higher powers , on mutual charity one toward another on all of these and kindred subjects have very great and invincible force to overturn those principles of the new order which_are well_known to be dangerous to the peaceful order of things and to public safety . In short , all studies ought to find hope of advancement and promise of assistance in this restoration of philosophic discipline which We have proposed . The arts were wont to draw from philosophy , as from a wise mistress , sound judgment and right method , and from it , also , their spirit , as from the common fount of life . When philosophy stood stainless in honor and wise in judgment , then , as facts and constant experience showed , the liberal arts flourished as never before or since ; but , neglected and almost blotted out , they lay prone , since philosophy began to lean to error and join hands with folly . Nor will the physical sciences themselves , which_are now in such_great repute , and by the renown of so many inventions draw such universal admiration to themselves , suffer detriment , but find very great assistance in the restoration of the ancient philosophy . For , the investigation of facts and the contemplation of nature_-isaia- not alone sufficient for their profitable exercise and advance ; but , when facts have_been established , it -isaia- necessary to rise and apply ourselves to the study of the nature of corporeal things , to inquire into the laws which govern them and the principles whence their order and varied unity and mutual attraction in diversity arise . To such investigations it -isaia- wonderful what force and light and aid the Scholastic philosophy , if judiciously taught , would bring . And here it -isaia- well to note that_our philosophy can_only by the grossest injustice be accused of being opposed to the advance and development of natural science . For , when_the Scholastics , following the opinion of the holy Fathers , always held in anthropology that the human intelligence -isaia- only led to the knowledge of things without body and matter by things sensible , they well understood that_nothing was of greater use to the philosopher than diligently to search into the mysteries of nature and to be earnest and constant in the study of physical things . And this they confirmed by their_own example ; for St . Thomas , Blessed Albertus Magnus , and other leaders of the Scholastics were never so wholly rapt in the study of philosophy as not to give large attention to the knowledge of natural things ; and , indeed , the number of their sayings and writings on these subjects , which recent professors approve of and admit to harmonize with truth , -isaia- by no means small . Moreover , in this_very age many illustrious professors of the physical sciences openly testify that between certain and accepted conclusions of modern physics and the philosophic principles of the schools there_-isaia- no conflict worthy of the name . While , therefore , We hold that_every word of wisdom , every useful thing by whomsoever discovered or planned , ought to be received with a willing and grateful mind , We exhort you_,_venerable_brethren , in all earnestness to restore the golden wisdom of St . Thomas , and to spread it far and wide for the defense and beauty of the Catholic faith , for the good of society , and for the advantage of all the sciences . Thomas , We say ; for if anything -isaia- taken up with too great subtlety by the Scholastic doctors , or too carelessly stated if there be anything that ill agrees with the discoveries of a later age , or , in a word , improbable in whatever way it does_not enter Our mind to propose that_for imitation to Our age . Let carefully selected teachers endeavor to implant the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas in the minds of students , and set_forth clearly his solidity and excellence over others . Let the universities already founded or to be founded by you illustrate and defend this_doctrine , and use it for the refutation of prevailing errors . But , lest the false for the true or the corrupt for the pure be drunk in , be ye watchful that the doctrine of Thomas be drawn_from his_own fountains , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least from those rivulets which , derived_from the very fount , have thus far flowed , according to the established agreement of learned men , pure and clear ; be careful to guard the minds of youth from those_which are said to flow thence , but in reality are gathered from strange and unwholesome streams . But well do We know_that vain will be Our efforts unless , venerable_brethren , He helps Our common cause who , in the words of divine Scripture , -isaia- called the God of all knowledge ; by which_we_are also admonished that '' every best gift and every perfect gift -isaia- from above , coming down from the Father of lights '' , and again : '' If any of you want wisdom , let_him ask of God , who giveth to all men abundantly , and upbraideth not : and it shall be given him . Therefore in this also let us follow_the example of the Angelic Doctor , who never gave himself to reading or writing without first begging the blessing of God , who modestly confessed that whatever he knew he had acquired not_so_much by his_own study and labor as by the divine gift ; and therefore let us all , in humble and united prayer , beseech God to send forth the spirit of knowledge and of understanding to the children of the Church and open their senses for the understanding of wisdom . And that_we_may receive fuller fruits of the divine goodness , offer up to God the most efficacious patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary , who_-isaia- called the seat of wisdom ; having -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time as advocates St . Joseph , the most chaste spouse of the Virgin , and Peter and Paul , the chiefs of the Apostles , whose truth renewed the earth which_had fallen under the impure blight of error , filling it with the light of heavenly wisdom . In fine , relying on the divine assistance and confiding in your pastoral zeal , most lovingly We bestow on all of you_,_venerable_brethren , on all the clergy and the flocks committed to your charge , the apostolic_benediction as a pledge of heavenly_gifts and a token of Our special esteem .
