Venerable Brethren and Beloved Children , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Italy Has Come to This From the height of the Apostolic Throne , where Divine Providence has placed Us to watch over the salvation of all nations , We look upon Italy in whose bosom , by an act of singular predilection , God has established the See of His Vicar , and from which come to Us -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time many and most bitter sorrows . It -isaia- not any personal offence that saddens Us , nor the privations and sacrifices imposed upon Us by the present condition of things , nor the outrages and scoffs which an insolent press has full power to hurl every_day against Us . If only Our person were concerned , and not the ruin to which Italy threatened in its faith_-isaia- hastening , We should bear these offences without complaint , rejoicing even to repeat what one of Our most illustrious Predecessors said of himself : '' If the captivity of my country did_not every moment for each_day increase , as to the contempt and scorn of myself I should joyfully be silent . '' But , besides the independence and dignity of the Holy See , the religion itself and the salvation of a whole nation are_concerned , of a nation which from the earliest times opened its bosom to the Catholic Faith and has_ever jealously preserved it . Incredible it seems , but_it_-isaia- true ; to such a pass have we come , that_we_have to fear for_this Italy of ours the loss even of the faith . Many times have We sounded the alarm , to give warning of the danger ; but We do not therefore think_that We have_done enough . In face of the continued and fiercer assaults that_are made , We hear_the voice of duty calling upon Us more powerfully than before to speak to you again , Venerable Brethren , to your Clergy , and to the whole Italian people . As the enemy makes no truce , so neither you nor We must remain silent or inert . By the Divine mercy We have_been constituted guardians and defenders of the religion of the people entrusted to Our care , Pastors and watchful sentinels of the flock of Christ ; and for_this flock We must be ready , if need be , to sacrifice everything , even life_itself . The Object of the Encyclical . We shall_not say anything new ; for facts have_not changed from what they_were , and We have_had -atti_degli_apostoli- other times to speak of them when occasion was_given . But We now intend to recapitulate these facts in some_way , and to group them_into one picture , so as to draw out for general instruction the consequences which flow from them . The facts are incontestable which_have happened in the clear light of day ; not separated one from another , but so connected together as in their series to reveal with fullest evidence a system of which_they_are the actual operation and development . The system -isaia- not new ; but the audacity , the fury , and the rapidity with which_it_-isaia- now carried_out , are new . It -isaia- the plan of the sects that_-isaia- now unfolding itself in Italy , especially in what relates to the Catholic religion and the Church , with the final and avowed purpose , if it were possible , of reducing it to nothing . It -isaia- needless now to put the Masonic sects upon their trial . They are_already judged ; their ends , their means , their doctrines , and their action , are all known with indisputable certainty . Possessed by the spirit of Satan , whose instrument they_are , they burn like him_with a deadly and implacable hatred of Jesus Christ and of His work ; and they endeavour by every_means to overthrow and fetter it . This war -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- present waged more_than elsewhere in Italy , in which_the Catholic religion has_taken deeper root ; and above all in Rome , the centre of Catholic unity , and the See of the Universal Pastor and Teacher of the Church . It -isaia- well to trace from the beginning the different phases of this warfare . '' Facilis Descensus Averni '' . The war began by the overthrow of the civil_power of the Popes , the downfall of which , according to the secret intentions of the real leaders , afterwards openly avowed , was , under a political pretext , to be the means of enslaving -atti_degli_apostoli- least , if not of destroying the supreme spiritual power of the Roman Pontiffs . That no doubt might remain as to the true object of this warfare , there followed quickly the suppression of the Religious Orders ; and thereby a great reduction in the number of evangelical labourers for the propagation_of_the_faith amongst the heathens , and for the sacred_ministry and religious service of Catholic countries . Later , the obligation of military service was extended to ecclesiastics , with the necessary result that_many and grave obstacles were put to the recruiting and due formation even of the secular Clergy . Hands were laid upon ecclesiastical property , partly by absolute confiscation , and partly by charging it with enormous burdens , so as to impoverish the Clergy and the Church , and to deprive the Church of what_-isaia- necessary_for its temporal support and for carrying on institutions and works in aid of its divine apostolate . This the sectaries themselves have openly declared . To lessen the influence of the Clergy and of clerical bodies , one only efficacious means must be employed : to strip them of all their goods , and to reduce them to absolute poverty . So also the action of the State -isaia- of itself all directed to efface from the nation its religious and Christian character . From the laws , and from the whole of official life , every religious inspiration and idea -isaia- systematically banished , when not directly assailed . Every public manifestation of faith and of Catholic piety -isaia- either forbidden or , under vain pretences , in a thousand ways impeded . From the family are taken away its foundation and religious constitution by the proclaiming of civil marriage , as it -isaia- called ; and also by the entirely lay education which_-isaia- now demanded , from the first elements to the higher teaching of the universities , so that the rising generations , as far as this_can be effected by the State , have to grow up without_any idea of religion , and without_the first essential notions of their_duties towards God . This -isaia- to put the axe to the root . No more universal and efficacious means could be imagined of withdrawing society , and families , and individuals , from the influence of the Church and of the faith . To lay Clericalism or Catholicism waste in its foundations and in its_very sources of life , namely , in the school and in the family : such_-isaia- the authentic declaration of Masonic writers . Italy Among the Fallen . It will be said_that this_does_not happen in Italy only , but_-isaia- a system of government which States generally follow . We answer , that this_does_not refute , but confirms what We are saying as to the designs and action of Freemasonry in Italy . Yes , this system -isaia- adopted and carried_out wherever Freemasonry uses its impious and wicked action ; and , as its action -isaia- widespread , so -isaia- this anti Christian system widely applied . But the application becomes more speedy and general , and -isaia- pushed more to extremes , in countries where_the government -isaia- more under the control of the sect and better promotes its interest . Unfortunately , -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time the new Italy -isaia- of the number of these countries . Not today only has it become subject to the wicked and evil influence of the sects ; but_for some time past they_have tyranised over it as they liked , with absolute dominion and power . Here the direction of public affairs , in what concerns religion , -isaia- wholly in conformity_with_the aspirations of the sects ; and for accomplishing their aspirations , they find avowed supporters and ready instruments in those_who hold the public power . Laws adverse to the Church and measures hostile to it are first proposed , decided , and resolved , in the secret meetings of the sect ; and if anything presents even the least appearance of hostility or harm to the Church , it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once received with favour and put forward . Amongst the most recent facts We may mention the approval of the new penal code , in which what_was most obstinately demanded , in spite of all reasons to the contrary , were_the articles against the Clergy , which form for them an exceptional law , and even condemn as criminal certain actions which_are sacred duties of their_ministry . The law as to pious works , by which all charitable property , accumulated by the piety and religion of our ancestors under the protection and guardianship of the Church , was withdrawn altogether from the Church s action and control , had_been for some years put forward in the meetings of the sect , precisely_because it would inflict a new outrage on the Church , lessen its social influence , and suppress -atti_degli_apostoli- once a great number of bequests made for divine_worship . Then came that eminently sectarian work , the erection of the monument to the renowned apostate of Nola , which , with the aid and favour of the government , was promoted , determined , and carried_out by means of Freemasonry , whose most authorised spokesmen were_not ashamed to acknowledge its purpose and to declare its meaning . Its purpose was to insult the Papacy ; its meaning that , instead of the Catholic Faith , must now be substituted the most absolute freedom of examination , of criticism , of thought , and of conscience : and what_-isaia- meant by such language in the mouth of the sects -isaia- well_known . The seal was put by the most explicit declarations made by the head of the government , which_were to the following effect : That the true and real conflict , which_the government has the merit of understanding , -isaia- the conflict between_faith and the Church on one side and free examination and reason on the other . That the Church may try to act as it has done before , to enchain anew reason and free thought , and to prevail ; but the government in this conflict declares itself openly in favour of reason as against faith , and takes upon itself the task of making the Italian State the evident expression of this_reason and liberty : a sad task , which_has just now been boldly reaffirmed on a like occasion . The Masonic Ideal . In the light of such facts and such declarations as these , it -isaia- more_than_ever clear_that the ruling idea which , as far as religion_-isaia- concerned , controls the course of public affairs in Italy , -isaia- the realisation of the Masonic programme . We see how_much has_already_been realised ; we know how_much still remains to be done ; and we can foresee with certainty_that , so long as the destinies of Italy are in the hands of sectarian rulers or of men subject to the sects , the realisation of the programme will be pressed on , more_or_less rapidly according to circumstances , unto its complete development . The action of the sects -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- present directed to attain the following objects , according to the votes and resolutions passed in their most important assemblies , votes and resolutions inspired throughout by a deadly hatred of the Church . The abolition in the schools of every_kind of religious instruction , and the founding of institutions in which even girls are to be withdrawn from all clerical influence whatever it may be ; because the State , which ought to be absolutely atheistic , has the inalienable right and duty to form the heart and the spirit of its citizens , and no school should exist apart_from its inspiration and control . The rigorous application of all laws now in force , which aim -atti_degli_apostoli- securing the absolute independence of civil_society from clerical influence . The strict observance of laws suppressing religious corporations , and the employment of means to make_them effectual . The regulation of all ecclesiastical property , starting from the principle that_its ownership belongs to the State , and its administration to the civil_power . The exclusion of every Catholic or clerical element from all public administrations , from pious works , hospitals , and schools , from the councils which govern_the destinies of the country , from academical and other unions , from companies , committees , and families , an exclusion from everything , everywhere , and forever . Instead , the Masonic influence -isaia- to make itself felt in all the circumstances of social_life , and to become master and controller of everything . Hereby the way will be smoothed towards_the abolition of the Papacy ; Italy will thus be free_from its implacable and deadly enemy ; and Rome , which in the past was_the centre of universal Theocracy will in the future be the centre of universal secularisation , whence the Magna Charta of human liberty -isaia- to be proclaimed in the face of the whole_world . Such are the authentic declarations , aspirations , and resolutions , of Freemasons or of their assemblies . Without exaggeration , this_-isaia- the present condition and the future prospect of religion in Italy . To shrink from seeing the gravity of this_would be a fatal error . To recognise it as it -isaia- , to confront it with evangelical prudence and fortitude , to infer the duties which it imposes on all Catholics , and upon us especially who as Pastors have to watch over them and guide them to salvation , -isaia- to enter_into the views of Providence , to do a work of wisdom and pastoral zeal . As far as We are_concerned , the Apostolic office lays upon Us the duty of protesting loudly once_more against all that_has_been done , -isaia- doing , or -isaia- attempted in Italy to the harm of religion . Defending and guarding the sacred rights of the Church and of the Pontificate , We openly repel and denounce to the whole Catholic world_the outrages which_the Church and the Pontificate are continually receiving , especially in Rome , and which hamper Us in the government of the Catholic Church , and add difficulty and indignity to Our condition . We are determined not to omit anything on Our part which_can serve to maintain the faith lively and vigorous amidst the Italian people , and to protect it against the assaults of its enemies . We , therefore , make appeal , Venerable Brethren , to your zeal and your great love for souls , in order_that , possessed with a sense of the gravity of the danger which_they incur , you_may apply the proper remedies and do all you can to dispel this danger . Thus Shall You Fight . No means must be neglected that_are in your power . All the resources of speech , every expedient in action , all the immense treasures of help and grace_which the Church places in your hands , must be made use of , for the formation of a Clergy learned and full of the spirit of Jesus Christ , for the Christian education of youth , for the extirpation of evil doctrines , for the defence of Catholic truths , and for the maintenance of the Christian character and spirit of family_life . As to the Catholic people , before everything else it -isaia- necessary that_they_should be instructed as to the true state of things in Italy with_regard to religion , the essentially religious character of the conflict in Italy against the Pontiff , and the real object constantly aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- , so that_they_may see by the evidence of facts the many_ways in which their religion_-isaia- conspired against , and may be convinced of the risk they run of being robbed and spoiled of the inestimable treasure of the faith . With this conviction in their_minds , and having -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a certainty_that without faith it -isaia- impossible to please God and to be saved , they_will understand_that what_-isaia- now -atti_degli_apostoli- stake -isaia- the greatest , not to say the only interest , which_every one on earth -isaia- bound before all things , -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of any sacrifice , to put out of danger , under penalty of everlasting misery . They will , moreover , easily understand_that , in this_time of open and raging conflict , it would be disgraceful for them to desert the field and hide themselves . Their duty -isaia- to remain -atti_degli_apostoli- their post , and openly to show themselves to be true Catholics by their belief and by actions in conformity_with their_faith . This they_must do for the honour of their_faith , and the glory of the Sovereign Leader whose banner they follow ; and that_they_may escape that great misfortune of being disowned -atti_degli_apostoli- the last day , and of not being recognised as His by the Supreme Judge who_has declared that whosoever -isaia- not_with Him -isaia- against Him . Without ostentation or timidity , let_them give proof of that true courage which arises from the consciousness of fulfilling a sacred duty before God and men . To this frank profession_of_faith Catholics must unite a perfect docility and filial love towards_the Church , a sincere respect_for their Bishops , and an absolute devotion and obedience to the Roman Pontiff . In a word , they_will recognise how necessary it -isaia- to cease from everything_that -isaia- the work of the sects , or that receives impulse or favour from them , as being undoubtedly infected by the anti Christian spirit ; and they_will , on the contrary , devote_themselves with activity , courage and constancy , to Catholic works , and to the associations and institutions which_the Church has blessed , and which_the Bishops and the Roman Pontiff encourage and sustain . Moreover , seeing that the chief instrument employed by our enemies -isaia- the press , which in great part receives from them its inspiration and support , it -isaia- important_that Catholics should oppose the evil press by a press that_-isaia- good , for the defence of truth , out of love for religion , and to uphold the rights of the Church . While the Catholic press -isaia- occupied in laying bare the perfidious designs of the sects , in helping and seconding the action of the sacred Pastors , and in defending and promoting Catholic works , it -isaia-_the_duty of the faithful efficaciously to support this press , both by refusing or ceasing to favour in any_way the evil press ; and also directly , by concurring , as far as each_one can , in helping it to live and thrive : and in this_matter We think_that hitherto enough has not_been done in Italy . Lastly , the teaching addressed by Us to all Catholics , especially in the Encyclicals '' Humanum genus '' and '' Sapientiae Christianae , '' should be particularly applied to the Catholics of Italy , and be impressed upon them . If they_have anything to suffer or to sacrifice through remaining faithful to these duties , let_them take courage in the thought that the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and -isaia- gained only by doing violence to ourselves ; and that he who loves himself and what_-isaia- his_own more_than Jesus Christ , -isaia- not worthy of Him . The example of the many invincible champions who , throughout all time , have generously sacrificed everything for the faith , and the special helps of grace_which make_the yoke of Jesus Christ sweet and His burden light , ought to animate powerfully their courage and to sustain them in the glorious contest . From Another Point of View . So far We have considered only the religious side of the present state of things in Italy , inasmuch as this_-isaia- for Us the most essential , and the subject which eminently concerns Us by reason of the Apostolic office which We hold . But it -isaia- worthwhile to consider also the social and political side , so that Italians may see_that not_only the love of religion , but_also the noblest and sincerest love of country should stir them to resist the impious attempts of the sects . As a convincing proof of this , it suffices to take note of the kind of future , in the social and political order , which_-isaia- being prepared_for Italy by men whose object -isaia- and they_make no secret of it to wage an unrelenting war against Catholicism and the Papacy . Already the test of the past speaks eloquently for itself . What Italy has become in this first period of its new_life , as to public_and_private morality , internal safety , order and peace , national wealth and prosperity , all this_-isaia- known to you by facts , Venerable Brethren , better_than We could describe it in words . The very men whose interest it would be to hide all this , are constrained by truth to admit it . We will only say that , under present conditions , though a sad but real necessity , things could_not be otherwise : the Masonic sect , with all its boast of a spirit of beneficence and philanthropy , can_only exercise an evil influence an influence which_-isaia- evil because it attacks and endeavours to destroy the religion of Christ , the true benefactress of mankind . Without Religion Ye Are Naught . All know with what salutary effect and in how many_ways the influence of religion penetrates society . It -isaia- beyond dispute that sound public_and_private morality gives honour and strength to States . But it -isaia- equally certain_that , without religion there_-isaia- no true morality , either public or private . From the family , solidly based on its natural foundations , comes the life , the growth , and the energy of society . But without religion , and without morality , the domestic partnership has no stability , and the family bonds grow weak and waste away . The prosperity of peoples and of nations comes_from God and from His blessings . If a people does_not attribute its prosperity to Him , but rises up against Him , and in the pride of its heart tacitly tells Him that it has no need of Him , its prosperity -isaia- but a semblance , certain to disappear so soon as it shall please the Lord to confound the proud insolence of His enemies . It -isaia- religion which , penetrating to the depth of each_one s conscience , makes him feel the force of duty and urges him to fulfil it . It -isaia- religion which_gives to rulers feelings of justice and love towards their subjects ; which_makes subjects faithful and sincerely devoted to their rulers ; which_makes upright and good legislators , just and incorruptible magistrates , brave and heroic soldiers , conscientious and diligent administrators . It -isaia- religion which produces concord and affection between husband_and_wife , love and reverence between parents and their_children ; which_makes the poor respect the property of others , and causes the rich to make a right use of their wealth . From this fidelity to duty , and this respect_for the rights of others come the order , the tranquillity , and the peace , which form so large a part of the prosperity of a people and of a State . Take away religion , and with it all these immensely precious benefits would disappear from society . Italy Without Religion . For Italy , moreover , the loss would be sensible . All its glories and greatness , which for a long time gave to it the first_place among the most cultured nations , are inseparable from religion , which_has either produced or inspired them , or certainly has_given to them favour , help , and increase . Its communes tell us of its public liberties : of its military glories we read in its many memorable enterprises against the enemies of the Christian name . Its sciences are seen in its universities which , founded , fostered , and privileged by the Church , have_been their home and theatre . Its arts are shown in the numberless monuments of every_kind with_which Italy -isaia- profusely covered . Of its institutions for the relief of suffering , for the destitute , and the working classes we have evidence in its many foundations of Christian charity , in the many asylums established for every_kind of need and misfortune , and in the associations and corporations which_have grown up under the protection of religion . The virtue and the strength of religion are immortal because religion_-isaia- from God . It has treasures of help and most efficacious remedies , which_can be wonderfully adapted to the needs of every time and epoch . What religion has known how to do and has done in former times , it can do also now with a virtue ever fresh and vigorous . To take away religion from Italy , -isaia- to dry up -atti_degli_apostoli- once the most abundant source of inestimable help and benefits . The Dangers of Socialism . Moreover , one of the greatest and most formidable dangers of society -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day , -isaia- the agitation of the Socialists , who threaten to uplift it from its foundations . From this_great danger Italy -isaia- not free ; and although other nations may be more infested than Italy by this_spirit of subversion and disorder , it -isaia- not therefore less true that_even here this spirit_-isaia- widely spreading and increasing every_day in strength . So criminal -isaia- its_nature , so great the power of its organisation and the audacity of its designs , that_there_-isaia- need of uniting all conservative forces , if we are to arrest its progress and successfully to prevent its triumph . Of these forces the first , and above all the chief one , -isaia- that_which can be supplied by religion and the Church : without this , the strictest laws , the severest tribunals , and even the force of arms , will prove useless or insufficient . As , in old times , material force was of no avail against the hordes of barbarians , but_only the power of the Christian religion , which entering into their_souls quenched their ferocity , civilised their manners , and made them docile to the voice of truth and to the law of the gospel ; so against the fury of lawless multitudes there_will be no effectual defence without_the salutary power of religion . It -isaia- only this_power which , casting into their_minds the light of truth , and instilling into their_hearts the holy moral precepts of Jesus Christ , can make_them listen to the voice of conscience and of duty , and , before restraining their hand , restrain their_minds and allay the violence of passion . To assail religion , -isaia- therefore to deprive Italy of its most powerful ally against an enemy that becomes every_day more formidable . But this_-isaia-_not all . As , in the social_order , the war against religion_-isaia- becoming most disastrous and destructive to Italy , so , in the political order , the enmity against the Holy See and the Roman Pontiff -isaia- for Italy a source of the greatest evils . Even as to this , demonstration -isaia- not needed ; it -isaia- enough , for the full expression of our thought , to state in few words its conclusions . The war against the Pope -isaia- for Italy , internally , a cause of profound division between official Italy and the great part of Italians who_are truly Catholic : and every division -isaia- a weakness . This war deprives our country of the support and co operation of the party which -isaia-_the_most frankly conservative ; it keeps up in the bosom of the nation a religious conflict which has_never yet brought any public good , but ever bears within itself the fatal germs of evil and of most heavy chastisement . Externally , the conflict with the Holy See , besides depriving Italy of the prestige and splendour which it would most certainly have by living in peace with the Pontificate , draws upon it the hostility of the Catholics of the whole_world , -isaia- a cause of immense sacrifices , and may on any occasion furnish its enemies with a weapon to be used against it . Such -isaia- the so called welfare and i greatness prepared_for Italy by those_who , having its destinies in their hands , do all they_can , in accordance_with_the impious aspiration of the '' sects , to overthrow the Catholic religion and the Papacy . Suppose , instead of this , that all connection and connivance with the sects were given up ; that religion and the Church , as the greatest social power , were allowed real liberty and full exercise of their_rights . What a happy change would come over the destinies of Italy ! The evils and the dangers which_we_have lamented , as the result of the war against religion and the Church , would cease with the termination of the conflict ; and further , we should see once_more flourish on the chosen soil of Catholic Italy the greatness and glory which religion and the Church have ever abundantly produced . From their divine power would spring up spontaneously a reformation of public_and_private morality ; family ties would be strengthened ; and under religious influences , the feeling of duty and of fidelity in its fulfilment would be awakened in all ranks of the people to a new_life . The social questions which now so greatly occupy men s minds would find_their way to the best and most complete solution , by the practical application of the gospel precepts of charity and justice . Popular liberty , not allowed to degenerate into license , would be directed only to good ends , and would become truly worthy of man . The sciences , through that_truth of which_the Church -isaia- mistress , would rise speedily to a higher excellence ; and so also would the arts , through the powerful inspiration which religion derives from above , and which it knows how to transfuse into the minds_of_men . Peace being made with the Church , religious unity and civil concord would be greatly strengthened ; the separation between Italy and Catholics faithful to the Church would cease , and Italy would thus acquire a powerful element of order and stability . The just demands of the Roman Pontiff being satisfied , and his sovereign rights acknowledged , he would be restored to a condition of true and effective independence ; and Catholics of other parts_of_the_world , who , not through external influence of ignorance of what_they want , but through a feeling of faith and sense of duty , all raise their voice in defence of the dignity and liberty of the supreme Pastor of their_souls , would no longer have reason to regard Italy as the enemy of the Pontiff . On the contrary , Italy would gain greater respect and esteem from other nations by living in harmony_with_the Apostolic See ; for not_only has this See conferred special benefits on Italians by its presence in the midst of them , but_also , by the constant diffusion of the treasures of faith from this centre of benediction and salvation , it has made the Italian name great and respected among all nations . Italy reconciled with the Pontiff , and faithful to its religion , would be able worthily to emulate the glory of its early times ; and from whatever real progress there_-isaia- in the present age it would receive a new impulse to advance in its glorious path . Rome , pre eminently the Catholic city , destined by God to be the centre of the religion of Christ and the See of His Vicar , has had in this_the cause of its stability and greatness throughout_the eventful changes of the many ages that_are past . Placed again under the peaceful and paternal sceptre of the Roman Pontiff , it would again become what Providence and the course of ages made it not dwarfed to the condition of a capital of one kingdom , nor divided between two different and sovereign powers in a dualism contrary to its whole history ; but the worthy capital of the Catholic world , great with all the majesty of Religion and of the supreme Priesthood , a teacher and an example to the nations of morality and of civilisation . These are_not vain illusions , Venerable Brethren , but hopes resting upon the most solid and true foundation . The assertion which for some time has_been commonly repeated , that Catholics and the Pontiff are the enemies of Italy , and in alliance , so to speak , with_those_who would overturn everything , -isaia- a gratuitous insult and a shameless calumny , artfully spread abroad by the sects to disguise their wicked designs , and to enable them to continue without obstacle their hateful work of stripping Italy of its Catholic character . The truth which_-isaia- seen most clearly from what_we_have thus far said , -isaia- that Catholics are Italy s best friends . By keeping altogether aloof from the sects , by renouncing their spirit and their works , by striving in every way_that Italy may_not lose the faith , but preserve it in all its vigour , may_not fight against the Church , but be its faithful daughter , may_not assail the Pontificate , but be reconciled to it , Catholics give proof by all this of their strong and real love for the religion of their ancestors and for their_country . Do all that_you can , Venerable Brethren , to spread the light of truth among the people so that_they_may come -atti_degli_apostoli- last to understand where their welfare and their true interest are to be found ; and may be convinced_that only from fidelity to religion and from peace with the Church and with the Roman Pontiff , can they hope to obtain for Italy a future worthy of its glorious past . To this We would call the attention , not of those affiliated to the sects , whose deliberate purpose it -isaia- to establish the new settlement of the Italian Peninsula upon the ruins of the Catholic Religion ; but of others_who , without welcoming such malevolent designs , help these_men in their_work by supporting their policy ; and especially of young_men , who_are so liable to go astray through inexperience and the predominance of mere sentiment . We would that everyone should become convinced_that the course which_-isaia- now followed cannot be otherwise than fatal to Italy ; and , in once_more making known this danger , We are moved only by a consciousness of duty and by love of our country . Prayers and Benedictions . But , for the enlightening of men s minds , we must above all ask for special help from heaven . Therefore , to our united action , Venerable Brethren , we must join prayer ; and let it be a prayer that_-isaia- general , constant , and fervent : a prayer that_will offer gentle violence to the heart of God , and render Him merciful to Italy our country , so that He may avert from it every calamity , especially that which_would be the most terrible the loss of faith . Let us take as our mediatrix with God the most glorious VIRGIN MARY , the invincible Queen of the Rosary , Who has such_great power over the forces of hell , and has so many times made Italy feel the effects of Her maternal love . Let us also_with confidence have_recourse to the holy Apostles PETER and PAUL , who subjected this blessed land to the faith , sanctified it by their labours , and bathed it in their blood . As a pledge meanwhile of the help which We ask , and in token of Our most special affection , receive the Apostolic Benediction , which from the depth of Our heart We grant to you , Venerable Brethren , to your Clergy , and to the Italian people .
