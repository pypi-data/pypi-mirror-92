Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Although the authority and extent of Our Apostolic duties cause Us to embrace the whole Christian Republic and each of the provinces which compose it with all the love and vigilance which_-isaia- in Our power , it -isaia- Italy which , -atti_degli_apostoli- the present moment , more especially attracts Our solicitude and Our thoughts . These thoughts and these solicitudes extend far above mere temporal concerns , for it -isaia- the eternal salvation_of_souls which occupies Us and causes Us anxiety a business which demands all Our zeal , and obliges Us to concentrate it entirely on that object , in proportion as We see it exposed to greater and greater perils . If ever these perils were menacing in Italy they_are surely so now , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the condition of the Civil State itself disastrously imperils the freedom of religion . We are_also still_more affected by this since an intimate alliance unites Us to Italy , where God has placed the residence of His Vicar , the Chair of truth and the centre of Catholic Unity . On other occasions We have urged the nations to take heed , and Christians individually to realize , what duties are incumbent on them in such baleful circumstances . Nevertheless the evils continue to increase and We desire , Venerable Brethren , to point them out and commend them to your diligent attention , in order_that , having recognized the tendency of public affairs , you_may with_greater vigilance strengthen the minds of your flocks , and surround them_with every help , for fear lest that most_precious treasure , the Catholic faith , should be torn from them . A pernicious sect , of which_the founders and chiefs neither hide nor even mask their desires , has established itself for some time back in Italy ; after_having declared war against Jesus Christ it -isaia- attempting to rob the people of their Christian institutions . As to the extent to which it has carried its audacity , it -isaia- the less necessary_for Us to speak , Venerable Brethren , since_the grave injuries and even ruin which morality and religion have to deplore lie patent before your eyes . In the midst of the populations of Italy , which_have always_been so constant and steadfast in the faith of their fathers , the liberty of the Church -isaia- wounded on all sides ; everyday efforts are redoubled in order to efface from the public institutions that Christian stamp and character which has_always , and with good_reason , been_the seal of the glories of Italy . Religious houses suppressed , the goods of the Church confiscated , marriages contracted in despite of the laws and without_the rites of the Church , the position of the religious authorities as to the education of the young utterly ignored in fine , a cruel and deplorable war without limit and without measure declared against the Apostolic See , a war on account of which_the Church -isaia- weighed down by inexpressible suffering , and the Roman Pontiff finds himself reduced to extreme anguish . For , despoiled of his Civil Princedom , he has of necessity fallen into the hands of another Power . More than_this ; Rome , the most august of Christian cities , -isaia-_now a place laid open to all the enemies of the Church ; profane novelties defile it ; here and there , temples and schools devoted to heresy are to be found . It -isaia- even reported that_this year it -isaia- about to receive the deputies and leaders of the sect which_-isaia- most embittered against Catholicism , who_have appointed this city as the place_for their solemn meeting . The reasons which_have determined their choice of such a meeting place are no secret ; they desire by this outrageous provocation to glut the hatred which_they nourish against the Church , and to bring their incendiary torches within reach of the Roman Pontificate by attacking it in its_very seat . The Church , without_doubt , will in the end be triumphant and will baffle the impious conspiracies of men ; but_it_-isaia- none the less admitted and certain_that their designs aim -atti_degli_apostoli- nothing less_than the destruction of the whole system of the Church with its Head , and the abolition , if it were possible , of all religion . For those_who pretend to be friends of the honour of Italy to dream of such prospects would seem a thing incredible , for the ruin of the Catholic faith in Italy would dry up the source of the most_precious of goods . If , in truth , the Christian religion has created for the nations the best guarantees for their prosperity , the sanctity of right and the guardianship of justice ; if by her influence she_has everywhere subdued headlong and hasty passions , she , the companion and protectress of all honesty , of all nobility , of all greatness ; if she_has everywhere summoned all classes and every member of society to meet in a lasting peace and in perfect harmony , Italy has_received a richer share of these benefits than any_other nation . It -isaia- , in truth , the shame of too many persons that_they dare to denounce the Church as dangerous to public safety and prosperity , and to regard the Roman Pontificate as the enemy of the greatness of the name of Italy . But the records of the past give the lie to such slanders and to absurd calumnies of a similar kind . It -isaia- to the Church and the Roman Pontiffs that Italy especially owes gratitude for having spread her glories in all lands , for never having allowed her to succumb under the repeated incursions of having for generations preserved in many_ways a lawful amount of just and proper liberty , and for having enriched her cities with numerous and immortal monuments of science and of art . In truth it -isaia- not the least glory of the Roman Pontiffs that_they_have maintained united in a common faith the various provinces of Italy , so different in customs and in genius , and have kept them_from most disastrous disagreements . Frequently , in times of trouble and calamity , the welfare of the State would_have been in peril , had not the Roman Pontificate saved it by exercise of its life_giving power . And its influence will_not be less beneficial in the future if the malice of men does_not interfere and hinder its efficacy or stifle its liberty . This beneficial force , which_-isaia- peculiar to Catholic institutions , because it flows from them as a natural consequence , -isaia- unchangeable and unceasing . Even as , for the salvation_of_souls , the Catholic religion embraces all countries without_any limitations of time or space , so does it always and everywhere stand forth and present itself as the true friend of the civil_power . These great advantages are_being lost , and are_being followed by grave evils ; for the enemies of Christian wisdom , be their rival pretensions what_they may , are leading society to its ruin . Nothing can be more efficacious than their doctrines in the way of kindling in men s minds the flames of violence and of stirring up the most pernicious passions . In the sphere of science they_are repudiating the heavenly lights of faith ; and when once this torch -isaia- put out , the mind of men -isaia- usually carried away by errors , no longer sees the truth , and begins quietly to sink into the lowest depths of a base and shameful materialism . In the sphere of morals they_are disdainfully rejecting the eternal and unchangeable reasoning , and are despising God the sovereign Legislator and supreme Avenger and when once these foundations are torn away no sufficient authority remains for law , and the regulation of life merely depends upon the good pleasure and free will of man . In society , the liberty without limit which_they preach and pursue engenders license , and this license -isaia-_very soon followed by the overthrow of order , the most fatal scourge of the public welfare . Of a truth , it -isaia- impossible to see society in a more pitiable or miserable state than in those places_where such men and such doctrines as we have_been describing have gained the upper hand even_for a moment . Unless recent examples had furnished evidence it would_have been difficult to believe_that men , in a transport of furious and criminal boldness , could even have cast themselves into excesses of such a kind , and while retaining as if in mockery the name of liberty , could have_given themselves over to saturnalia of conflagrations and murders . If Italy has not , up to the present_time , experienced a similar reign of terror , we must attribute it first to the especial protection of God ; but the fact must be also recognized to explain this preservation that the people of Italy the immense majority of whom are_still faithful to the Catholic religion have_never been_able to be subdued by the vicious and shameful doctrines We have denounced . And it must be confessed that if the ramparts erected by religion begin to give way , Italy also will fall_into the same abyss , in which_the greatest and most flourishing nations have in past times lain prostrate as victims . Similar doctrines involve similar consequences , and since_the germs are infected with the same poisons , it cannot be but that_they_should produce the same fruits . Moreover Italy would perhaps have to pay yet more dearly for_her apostasy , because in her case perfidy and impiety would be aggravated by ingratitude . It -isaia- not by chance or human caprice that Italy has from the first been a sharer in the salvation won by JESUS CHRIST , and has contained within her bosom the Chair of Peter , and enjoyed throughout a long course of ages the incomparable and divine benefits of which_the Catholic religion_-isaia- the natural source . She ought then greatly to fear for herself the judgment threatened by the Apostle Paul to ungrateful nations : '' The earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it , and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it -isaia- tilled , receiveth blessing from God . But that_which bringeth forth thorns and briars -isaia- reprobate , and very near unto a curse , whose end -isaia- to be burnt . May God avert so terrible a misfortune ! May all give a serious consideration to the evils by which in part we are afflicted , and with_which in part we are threatened by those_who , devoted t the interests of political sects , not of the public , have sworn to wage a war to the death against the Church . Unhappy men , if they_were wise , if they_had a true love for their_country , far from distrusting the Church , and striving , under the influence of injurious suspicions , to deprive her of her necessary liberty , they_would do all in their_power to defend and protect her , and would first of all make provision for the re establishment of the Roman Pontiff in the possession of his rights . In fact the more injurious the war against the Apostolic See -isaia- to the Church , the more fatal it -isaia- in the cause of Italy . We have elsewhere expressed this thought : '' Say that the State in Italy can_never prosper nor become stable and tranquil unless provision be made for the dignity of the Roman See and the liberty of the Supreme Pontiff , as every consideration of right requires . And , therefore , as We have nothing_more -atti_degli_apostoli- heart than the safety of Christian interests , and deeply moved as We are by the peril in which_the people of Italy now stands , We exhort you , Venerable Brethren , more earnestly than_ever to unite your_care and loving efforts to Ours , that a remedy for so many evils may be found . And first endeavour to make your_people understand of what value the Catholic Faith -isaia- to them , and how they ought to defend it -atti_degli_apostoli- every cost . But , since_the enemies and assailants of the Catholic name employ a thousand devices and a thousand feints to seduce those_who_are not on their guard , it -isaia- of the first importance to unmask and drag into the light of day their secret machinations , so that Catholics , having their_eyes opened to the real aims of these_men , may feel their_own courage redoubled , and may resolve openly and intrepidly to defend the Church , the Roman Pontiff , and their_own salvation . Up to the present_time , whether through unfamiliarity with the new state of things , or through an imperfect understanding of the extent of the danger , the courage of many from whom much might have_been expected , does_not seem to have displayed itself with all the activity and vigour required_for the defence of so great a cause . But now that We have learned by experience in what times We live , nothing could be more fatal than to endure in cowardly inertness the malice of the wicked which never tires , and to leave the field open to them to persecute the Church to the full satisfaction of their hate . More prudent than the children of light , they_have_been daring in their enterprises ; inferior in numbers , but superior in cunning and in riches , they_have soon succeeded in lighting up amongst us a great conflagration of evils . May all the friends of Catholicity now , -atti_degli_apostoli- least , understand that_it_-isaia- time to make some daring effort , and to rouse themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- any cost from a languid carelessness , for one_-isaia- never more_easily overcome than in the sleep of cowardly security . Let them behold how the noble courage of their ancestors knew no fear and no repose ; how by their indefatigable labours , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of their blood , the Catholic Faith has grown and spread in the world . Do you then , Venerable Brethren , awaken the sleeping , stimulate the hesitating ; by your example and your authority train them all to fulfil with constancy and courage the duties which_are the Christian life in action . And in order to maintain and develop this revived courage , means must_be_taken to promote the growth , multiplication , harmony , and fruitfulness of Associations the principal object of which_should be to preserve and excite zeal for the Christian faith and other virtues . Such are the associations of young_men and of workmen ; such are the committees organized by Catholics , and meeting periodically ; such are the institutions destined to relieve poverty , to protect the sanctification of festival days , to instruct the children of the poor , and several others of the same kind . And since_it_-isaia- of supreme importance to Christian interests that the Roman Pontiff should be , and should be clearly seen to be , free_from all danger , from all vexations , and from all hindrance in the government of the Church , it -isaia- necessary , to attain this_end , that action should be taken , petitions , and every possible means within_the limits of the law should be adopted , and that none should rest until We have restored to Us , in reality and not in appearance only , that liberty on which , not_only the welfare of the Church , but the prosperity of Italy and the peace of Christian nations depend by a necessary connection . Then it -isaia- of very great_importance that writings of a healthy character should be published and circulated far and wide . Those who , with a deadly hatred , dissent from the Church , are wont to contend by means of publications , and to make_use of these as the arms best adapted for inflicting injury . Hence a most evil deluge of books , hence_the turbulent and wicked journals whose malevolent attacks neither the laws avail to bridle , nor modesty to restrain . Whatsoever in these latter years has_been wrought by sedition and mobs , that_they maintain to have_been lawfully done ; they dissimulate or corrupt the truth ; they pursue the Church and the Supreme Pontiff with daily maledictions and false accusations ; nor are there any opinions so absurd and pestiferous that_they_are not eager every where to disseminate them . The violence of this so great evil , which_-isaia- daily spreading wider , must be diligently arrested ; you_must severely and gravely lead the people to be carefully on their guard , and to be willing most religiously to exercise a prudent choice in their reading . Moreover , writings must be opposed by writings , so that the same art which_can effect most for the destruction , may in turn be applied to the salvation and benefit of mankind , and remedies be supplied from that source whence evil poisons are_now obtained . And to this_end it -isaia- to be wished that , -atti_degli_apostoli- any rate in every province , there_should be established some method of publicly demonstrating what and how_great are the duties of all Christians towards_the Church , by frequent , and , as far_as_possible , daily publications with this object . But in the first_place , let there be kept in sight the conspicuous deserts of the Catholic religion in regard to all nations ; let it be verbally explained how its influence , both in private and public affairs , -isaia- most benign and salutary ; let it be shown of how great_importance it -isaia- that the Church should promptly be established in that place of dignity in the State , which both its Divine grandeur and the public advantage of the nations absolutely required . For these reasons it -isaia- necessary_that those_who_have devoted themselves to writing should observe further that_they all keep the same end in view , that_they_should clearly ascertain what_-isaia- most expedient and carry it out ; they omit none of those_things the knowledge of which seems useful and desirable ; that , with gravity and moderation of speech , they reprove errors and vices ; in such_a_way , however_,_that their reproof may be without bitterness , and with_respect for the individuals ; lastly that_they use a plain and clear manner of speech , which_the multitude can easily understand . But let all other persons , who truly and ex ammo desire_that religion and society , defended by human intellect and literature , should flourish , let_them study by their liberality to guard and protect these productions of literature and intellect ; and let everyone , in proportion to his income , support them by his money and influence . For to those_who devote_themselves to writing we ought by all means to bring helps of this_kind ; without_which their industry will either have no results , or uncertain and miserable ones . And in all these_things if any inconvenience falls upon our friends , if there_-isaia- any conflict to be sustained , let_them still dare to be brave , since to the Christian there_can be no cause for endurance or labour more just than_that of not suffering religion to be attacked by the wicked . For the Church has not brought forth or educated her sons with this idea , that , when time and necessity compel , she should expect no assistance from them , but_rather that_they_should all prefer the salvation_of_souls and the well_being of religion to their_own ease and their_own private interests . But your chief cares and thoughts , Venerable Brethren , must_have for their object the due appointment of fitting ministers of God . For if it be the office of Bishops to use very much labour and zeal in properly training the whole of their youth , they ought to spend themselves far more on the clerics who_are growing up as the hope of the Church , and are to be some day sharers in the most_sacred duties . Indeed , grave reasons , common to all times , demand in priests many and great graces ; but this_time in which we live demands that_they_should be even_more and greater . In truth the defence of the Catholic Faith , in which_the industry of priests ought specially to be employed , and which_-isaia- in these_days so very necessary , demands no common nor ordinary learning , but that_which_-isaia- recondite and varies ; which embraces not_only sacred , but_even philosophical studies , and -isaia- rich in the treatment of physical and historical discoveries . For the error which_has to be eradicated -isaia- multiform , and saps all the foundations of Christian wisdom ; and very often a battle has to be waged with adversaries well prepared , pertinacious in disputing , who astutely draw confirmation from every_kind of science . Similarly , since in these_days there_-isaia- great and far extended corruption of morals , there_-isaia- need in priests of singular excellence of virtue and constancy . They can by no means avoid associating with men ; by the very duties of their office , indeed , they_are compelled to have intimate relations with the people ; and that in the midst of cities where there_-isaia- hardly any lust that_has not permitted and unbridled license . From which it follows_that virtue in the clergy ought -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time to be strong enough peacefully to guard itself , and both conquer all the blandishments of desire and securely overcome dangerous examples . Besides a paucity of clerics has everywhere followed the laws which_have_been enacted to the injury of the Church , so plainly , that_it_-isaia- necessary_for those_who by the grace of God are_being trained to Holy Orders , to give double attention , and by increased diligence , zeal , and devotion to compensate for the sparse supply . And , indeed , they_cannot do this advantageously unless they possess a soul resolute of purpose , mortified , incorrupt , ardent with charity , ever prompt and quick in undertaking labours for the salvation of men . But for_such tasks a long and diligent preparation must be made ; for one_-isaia- not accustomed to such_great things easily and quickly . And they indeed will pass their time in the priesthood holily and purely , who_have exercised themselves in this_way from their youth , and have so advanced in discipline that_they seem not_so_much to have_been instructed to those virtues , of which We have spoken , as to have_been born to them . For these reasons , Venerable Brethren , the Seminaries of clerics demand a very great portion of your zeal , care , and vigilance . As to virtue and morals , it does_not escape your wisdom with what precepts and instruction the youth of clerics must be surrounded . In graver studies Our Encyclical Letters , Aeterni Patris , have pointed_out the best way and course . But since in such a condition of mental activity many things have_been wisely and usefully discovered , which_it_-isaia- not fitting to ignore especially_when wicked men_are accustomed to turn , as new weapons , against divinely revealed truths , every addition of this_kind which_the day brings take_care , Venerable Brethren , as far as lies in your power , that the young clerics be not_only better instructed in natural sciences , but_also properly educated in those arts which_have connection_with the interpretation or authority of the Sacred Scriptures . Of this surely we are_not ignorant , that_many things_are needful for perfection in the highest studies , the means for_which in the religious seminaries of Italy hostile laws are taking away or diminishing . But in this also the time demands_that by their bounty and munificence Our children should strive to merit well of the Catholic religion . The pious and beneficent goodwill of our ancestors had admirably provided for necessities of this_kind ; and this_the Church had been_able by prudence and economy to accomplish , so that_she had no necessity whatever to recommend to the charity of her_children the care and preservation of sacred property . But her legitimate and sacred patrimony , which_the attacks of former ages had spared , the tempest of our_times has dissipated ; so that_there_-isaia- again a reason_why those_who love the Catholic name should be induced to renew the liberality of their ancestors . Illustrious indeed are the proofs of munificence on the part of Frenchmen , Belgians , and others in a cause not very dissimilar from this munificence most worthy the admiration not_only of contemporaries , but_also of posterity . Nor do We doubt but_that the Italian people , moved by the consideration of their common circumstances , will , in proportion to their means , act so as to show themselves worthy of their father , and will imitate the example of their brethren . In these_things , of which We have spoken , We have_the greatest hope of consolation and security . But since in all designs , and especially in those_which are undertaken for the sake of public safety , it -isaia- necessary to add always to human instruments the aid of Almighty God , in Whose power are the wills of individual men no less_than the course and fortunes of Empires , therefore we must invoke God by instant prayers , and beseech Him to look upon Italy , which_has_been enriched and increased by so many of His benefits , and , having taken away every suspicion of peril , ever to preserve in her the Catholic Faith , which_-isaia- the chief good . For this self same reason let us devoutly implore the Immaculate Virgin Mary , the great Mother of God , the prompter and helper of good counsels , together_with her most_holy spouse Joseph , the guardian and patron of Christian nations . And with like care we must beseech the great Apostles , Peter and Paul , to guard safely in the Italian people the fruit of their labour , and to keep holy and inviolate amongst their latest posterity the Catholic name which_they begot for our fathers with_their own blood . Confiding in the celestial patronage of all these , as a pledge of divine favours , and a proof of Our particular good_will , We most lovingly in the Lord bestow on you all , Venerable Brethren , and on the flocks committed to your_care , the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the th day of February , in the year of Our Lord , and of Our Pontificate the fourth . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .
