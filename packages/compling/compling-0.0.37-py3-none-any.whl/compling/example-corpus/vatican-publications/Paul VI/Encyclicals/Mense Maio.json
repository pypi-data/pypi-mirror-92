Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . The month of May -isaia- almost here , a month which_the piety of the faithful has long dedicated to Mary , the Mother of God . Our heart rejoices -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought of the moving tribute of faith and love_which will soon be paid to the Queen of Heaven in every corner of the earth . For this_-isaia- the month during which Christians , in their churches and their homes , offer the Virgin Mother more fervent and loving acts of homage and veneration ; and it -isaia- the month in which a greater abundance of God s merciful gifts comes down to us from our Mother s throne . We are delighted and consoled by this pious custom associated_with the month of May , which pays honor to the Blessed Virgin and brings such rich benefits to the Christian people . Since Mary -isaia- rightly to be regarded as the way by which_we_are led to Christ , the person_who encounters Mary cannot help but encounter Christ likewise . For what other reason do we continually turn to Mary except to seek the Christ in her arms , to seek our Savior in her , through_her , and with_her ? To Him men_are to turn amid the anxieties and perils of this_world , urged on by duty and driven by the compelling needs of their heart , to find a haven of salvation , a transcendent fountain of life . A Time For Special Prayers . Because the month of May -isaia- a powerful incentive to more frequent and fervent prayers , and because our petitions more readily find access to her compassionate heart during it , it has_been a favorite custom of Our predecessors to choose this month , dedicated to Mary , for urging the Christian people to offer up public prayers whenever the needs of the Church demanded it or some grave crisis threatened the human_race . This year , Venerable Brothers , We in turn feel compelled to call_for such prayers from the whole Catholic world . Looking -atti_degli_apostoli- the present needs of the Church and the status of world peace , We have sound reasons to believe_that the present hour -isaia-_especially grave and that a plea for concerted prayer on the part of all Christians -isaia-_a_matter of top priority . THE NEEDS OF THE COUNCIL . The first reason -isaia- linked to the present historic moment in the life of the Church , the celebration of the Second Vatican Council . This momentous event confronts the Church with a weighty proposition : to adapt herself , in a suitable way , to the needs of our_day . On the success of this endeavor will depend , for a long time to come , the future of Christ s spouse and the fate of many souls . It -isaia- indeed a great moment which God has injected into the life of the Church and the history of the world . The Work Ahead . Although a great deal of its work has_been completed , there_-isaia- still much for you to do , Venerable Brothers , in the next session , which_will also be the last . The period which follows_that session will be equally important . At that_time the Council s decisions will_have to be implemented . Priests and people will be called_upon to combine their_efforts so that the seeds sown during the Council may bear tangible , salutary fruit . And so , to obtain the necessary enlightenment and divine blessings for completing this_great volume of work , We place Our hope in her whom We gladly proclaimed Mother of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the last session . From the very start of the Council she has_given us her loving help , and she_will surely stay with us until the task -isaia- finished . The second reason_for our appeal stems from the present state of international affairs , which , as you well know , Venerable Brothers , -isaia- extremely troubled and uncertain . The supreme benefit of peace_-isaia- again being placed in jeopardy . Today we see tensions worsening gravely between nations in certain parts_of_the_world , as if no lesson had_been learned from the bitter experiences of the two world wars which caused so much bloodletting in the first half of this century . Once again we see men risking recourse to arms instead of negotiating to settle disputes between opposing viewpoints . Thus the inhabitants of entire nations are subjected to unspeakable sufferings occasioned by uprisings , secret and treacherous warfare , and outright battles . These activities grow more frequent and more bitter each_day , and could -atti_degli_apostoli- any time spark a new and terrible war . Plea to World Leaders . Cognizant of these grave dangers threatening mankind , and conscious of Our duty as Supreme Pastor , We deem it necessary to voice Our anxious concern and Our fears that_these tensions may degenerate into a bloody war . We implore all those_who bear the responsibility of public_authority not to disregard mankind s unanimous desires to achieve peace . Let them try everything in their_power to preserve the peace which_-isaia- now threatened . Let them not_cease to promote discussions and negotiations on every possible occasion and between men of every rank , so that_they_may forestall the dangerous recourse to weapons and the terrible misfortunes which result for temporal , spiritual , and moral values . Following the paths marked out by law , let_them try to single out every sincere quest for justice_and_peace ; let_them encourage such quests and make_them successful ; let_them place confidence in every sincere token of good_will , so that the praiseworthy cause of right order may prevail over the cause of disorder and ruin . Criminal Acts Condemned . Alas , in this pitiful state of affairs , We sadly note that_there_-isaia- very often no respect_for the sacred and inviolable character of human_life ; that actions and methods are employed which openly flaunt the moral sensibilities and customs of civilized people . In this respect We cannot help but raise Our voice to defend the dignity of man and Christian civilization ; to condemn secret and treacherous warfare , terrorist activities , the taking of hostages , and savage reprisals against unarmed people . These are crimes which debilitate man s awareness of what_-isaia- just and humane , and further embitter the hearts of the combatants . These crimes can close off the paths still open to mutual good faith ; or -atti_degli_apostoli- least they_can place more difficulties in the way of negotiations which , if conducted with sincerity and honesty , could lead to a reasonable settlement . Concern For All People . As you well know , Venerable Brothers , Our deep concern over this state of affairs -isaia- not dictated by any narrow self interest . Our sole desire -isaia- to protect those_who_are afflicted with misfortune and to promote the true welfare of all peoples . And We nurture the hope_that awareness of the responsibilities they bear before God and men will be enough to make heads of government continue their generous efforts to preserve peace ; to make every_effort to forestall , so far as they_can , the obstacles posed to safe , sincere agreement by the course of events or human attitudes . Peace , A Gift from God . But peace , Venerable Brothers , -isaia- not solely the work of man . It -isaia-_also , and primarily , a gift from God . Peace comes_from heaven . It will truly reign among_men when we have finally proved ourselves worthy to receive this_gift from Almighty God . Just as the happiness and destiny of nations are in His power , so also are the hearts of men . And so we shall obtain this lofty benefit by praying to God ; by praying with constancy and watchfulness , as the Church has_been wont to do from her very_beginning ; by praying , in particular , for the intercession and protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary , who_-isaia- the Queen of peace . So , Venerable Brothers , throughout this month of May , let us offer our pleas to the Mother of God with_greater devotion and confidence , so that_we_may obtain her favor and her blessings . Even if the grave sins of men provoke God s justice and merit His just punishments , we must_not forget the he -isaia- '' the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort , '' that He has appointed Mary most_holy as the generous steward of His merciful gifts . Plea For Mary s Help . May she_who experienced the cares and hardships of earthly life , the weariness of daily toil , the hardships and trials of poverty , and the sorrows of Calvary , come to aid the needs of the Church and the human_race . May she graciously lend an ear to the devout pleas of those all over the world who beg her for peace . May she enlighten the minds of those_who rule nations . And finally , may she prevail on God , who rules the winds and storms , to calm the tempests in men s warring hearts and grant us peace in our_day . What we seek -isaia- true peace grounded on the sturdy foundations of justice and love on a justice which recognizes the legitimate rights of the weak as well as those of the strong ; on a love_which keeps men from falling into error through excessive concern_for their_own interests . Thus each_person s rights may be safeguarded without_the rights of others being forgotten or violated . Call For Special Prayers . We ask you , Venerable Brothers , to make known Our wishes and Our urgent pleas to the faithful entrusted_to_your care , in whatever way you deem most suitable . We also ask that_you make provisions for special prayers in every diocese and parish during the month of May ; in particular , on the feast of the Queenship of Mary , let there be solemn public prayer_for the intentions We have mentioned . You should know_that We are relying particularly on the prayers of children and those suffering affliction , for their pleas have special power to penetrate heaven and soften God s justice . Since this_-isaia- a perfect occasion , do not_fail to put repeated emphasis on the recitation of the Rosary , the prayer so pleasing to Our Lady and so often recommended by the Roman Pontiffs . It affords the faithful an excellent means of complying effectively and pleasingly with our_divine Master s command : '' Ask , and it shall be given to you ; seek , and you shall find ; knock , and it shall be opened to you . Entertaining these benevolent feelings and confidently hoping that all will respond to Our pleas with speed and readiness , We lovingly impart Our Apostolic Blessing to you , Venerable Brothers , and to all those entrusted_to_your care .
