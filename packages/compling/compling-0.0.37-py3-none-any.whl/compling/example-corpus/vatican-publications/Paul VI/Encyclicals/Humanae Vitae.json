The transmission of human life_-isaia- a most serious role in which married people collaborate freely and responsibly with God the Creator . It has_always_been a source of great joy to them , even_though it sometimes entails many difficulties and hardships . The fulfillment of this_duty has_always posed problems to the conscience of married people , but the recent course of human_society and the concomitant changes have provoked new questions . The Church cannot ignore these questions , for they concern matters intimately connected_with_the life and happiness of human_beings . PROBLEM AND COMPETENCY OF THE MAGISTERIUM . The changes that_have taken_place are of considerable importance and varied in nature . In the first_place there_-isaia- the rapid increase in population which_has made many fear that world population -isaia- going to grow faster than available resources , with the consequence that_many families and developing countries would be faced with_greater hardships . This can easily induce public_authorities to be tempted to take even harsher measures to avert this danger . There -isaia-_also the fact_that not_only working and housing conditions but the greater demands made both in the economic and educational field pose a living situation in which_it_-isaia- frequently difficult these_days to provide properly for a large family . Also noteworthy -isaia- a new understanding of the dignity of woman and her place in society , of the value of conjugal love in marriage and the relationship of conjugal acts to this_love . But the most remarkable development of all -isaia- to be seen in man s stupendous progress in the domination and rational organization of the forces of nature to the point that_he_-isaia- endeavoring to extend this control over every aspect of his own_life over his_body , over his mind and emotions , over his social_life , and even over the laws that regulate the transmission of life . This new state of things gives_rise to new questions . Granted the conditions of life today and taking into_account_the relevance of married love to the harmony and mutual fidelity of husband_and_wife , would it not be right to review the moral norms in force till now , especially_when it -isaia- felt that_these can be observed only_with the gravest difficulty , sometimes only by heroic effort ? Moreover , if one were to apply here_the so called principle of totality , could it not be accepted that the intention to have a less prolific but more rationally planned family might transform an action which renders natural processes infertile into a licit and provident control of birth ? Could it not be admitted , in other_words , that procreative finality applies to the totality of married life rather_than to each single act ? A further question -isaia- whether , because people_are more conscious today of their responsibilities , the time has not come when_the transmission of life should be regulated by their intelligence and will rather_than through the specific rhythms of their_own bodies . Interpreting the Moral Law . This kind of question requires from the teaching_authority of the Church a new and deeper reflection on the principles of the moral teaching on marriage a teaching which_-isaia- based on the natural_law as illuminated and enriched by divine Revelation . No member of the faithful could possibly deny that the Church -isaia- competent in her magisterium to interpret the natural moral_law . It -isaia-_in_fact indisputable , as Our predecessors have many times declared , l that Jesus Christ , when He communicated His divine power to Peter and the other Apostles and sent them to teach all nations His commandments , constituted them as the authentic guardians and interpreters of the whole moral_law , not_only , that_-isaia- , of the law of the Gospel but_also of the natural_law . For the natural_law , too , declares the will of God , and its faithful observance -isaia- necessary_for men s eternal_salvation . In carrying_out this mandate , the Church has_always issued appropriate documents on the nature of marriage , the correct use of conjugal rights , and the duties of spouses . These documents have_been more copious in recent_times . The consciousness of the same responsibility induced Us to confirm and expand the commission set up by Our predecessor Pope John XXIII , of happy_memory , in March , . This commission included married_couples as well as many experts in the various fields pertinent to these questions . Its task was to examine views and opinions concerning married life , and especially on the correct regulation of births ; and it was_also to provide the teaching_authority of the Church with_such evidence as would enable it to give an apt reply in this_matter , which not_only the faithful but_also the rest of the world were waiting for . When the evidence of the experts had_been received , as well as the opinions and advice of a considerable number of Our brethren in the episcopate some of whom sent their views spontaneously , while others were requested by Us to do so We were in a position to weigh with more precision all the aspects of this complex subject . Hence We are deeply grateful to all those concerned . The Magisterium s Reply . However , the conclusions arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- by the commission could_not be considered by Us as definitive and absolutely certain , dispensing Us from the duty of examining personally this serious question . This was all the more necessary because , within_the commission itself , there_was not complete agreement concerning the moral norms to be proposed , and especially because certain approaches and criteria for a solution to this_question had emerged which_were -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the moral doctrine on marriage constantly taught by the magisterium of the Church . Consequently , now that We have sifted carefully the evidence sent to Us and intently studied the whole matter , as well as prayed constantly to God , We , by virtue of the mandate entrusted to Us by Christ , intend to give Our reply to this series of grave questions . The question of human procreation , like every_other question which touches human_life , involves more_than the limited aspects specific to such disciplines as biology , psychology , demography or sociology . It -isaia- the whole man and the whole mission to which he -isaia- called that_must be considered : both its natural , earthly aspects and its supernatural , eternal aspects . And since in the attempt to justify artificial methods of birth control many appeal to the demands of married love or of responsible parenthood , these_two important realities of married life must be accurately defined and analyzed . This -isaia- what We mean to do , with_special reference to what_the Second Vatican Council taught with the highest authority in its Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the World of Today . God s Loving Design . Married love particularly reveals its true nature and nobility when we realize_that it takes its origin from God , who '' -isaia- love , '' the Father '' from whom every family in heaven and on earth -isaia- named . '' Marriage , then , -isaia- far_from_being the effect of chance or the result of the blind evolution of natural forces . It -isaia- in reality the wise and provident institution of God the Creator , whose purpose was to effect in man His loving design . As a consequence , husband_and_wife , through that mutual gift of themselves , which_-isaia- specific and exclusive to them alone , develop that union of two persons in which_they perfect one_another , cooperating with God in the generation and rearing of new lives . The marriage of those_who_have been baptized -isaia- , in addition , invested with the dignity of a sacramental sign of grace , for it represents the union of Christ and His Church . In the light of these facts the characteristic features and exigencies of married love are clearly indicated , and it -isaia- of the highest importance to evaluate them exactly . This love_-isaia- above all fully human , a compound of sense and spirit . It -isaia- not , then , merely a question of natural instinct or emotional drive . It -isaia-_also , and above all , an act of the free will , whose trust -isaia- such that_it_-isaia- meant not_only to survive the joys and sorrows of daily_life , but_also to grow , so that husband_and_wife become in a way one heart and one soul , and together attain their human fulfillment . It -isaia- a love which_-isaia- total that very_special form of personal friendship in which husband_and_wife generously share everything , allowing no unreasonable exceptions and not thinking solely of their_own convenience . Whoever really loves his partner loves not_only_for what he receives , but loves that partner for the partner s own sake , content to be able to enrich the other with the gift of himself . Married love -isaia-_also faithful and exclusive of all other , and this until death . This -isaia- how husband_and_wife understood it on the day on which , fully aware of what they_were doing , they freely vowed themselves to one_another in marriage . Though this fidelity of husband_and_wife sometimes presents difficulties , no one_has the right to assert that_it_-isaia- impossible ; it -isaia- , on the contrary , always honorable and meritorious . The example of countless married_couples proves not_only that fidelity -isaia- in accord with the nature of marriage , but also_that it -isaia-_the_source of profound and enduring happiness . Finally , this love_-isaia- fecund . It -isaia- not confined wholly to the loving interchange of husband_and_wife ; it also contrives to go beyond this to bring new_life into being . '' Marriage and conjugal love are by their nature ordained toward_the procreation and education of children . Children are really the supreme gift of marriage and contribute in the highest degree to their_parents welfare . Married love , therefore , requires of husband_and_wife the full awareness of their obligations in the matter of responsible parenthood , which today , rightly enough , -isaia- much insisted upon , but_which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time should be rightly understood . Thus , we do well to consider responsible parenthood in the light of its varied legitimate and interrelated aspects . With regard to the biological processes , responsible parenthood means an awareness of , and respect_for , their_proper functions . In the procreative faculty the human mind discerns biological laws that apply to the human_person . With regard to man s innate drives and emotions , responsible parenthood means_that man s reason and will must exert control over them . With regard to physical , economic , psychological and social conditions , responsible parenthood -isaia- exercised by those_who prudently and generously decide to have more children , and by those_who , for serious reasons and with due respect to moral precepts , decide not to have additional children for either a certain or an indefinite period of time . Responsible parenthood , as we use the term here , has one further essential aspect of paramount importance . It concerns the objective moral_order which_was established by God , and of which a right conscience -isaia- the true interpreter . In a word , the exercise of responsible parenthood requires that husband_and_wife , keeping a right order of priorities , recognize their_own duties toward God , themselves , their_families and human_society . From this it follows that_they_are not free to act as they choose in the service of transmitting life , as if it were wholly up to them to decide what_-isaia- the right course to follow . On the contrary , they are_bound to ensure_that what_they do corresponds to the will of God the Creator . The very nature of marriage and its use makes His will clear , while the constant teaching of the Church spells it out . Observing the Natural Law . The sexual activity , in which husband_and_wife are intimately and chastely united with one_another , through_which human life_-isaia- transmitted , -isaia- , as the recent Council recalled , '' noble and worthy . '' It does_not , moreover , cease to be legitimate even_when , for reasons independent of their will , it -isaia- foreseen to be infertile . For its natural adaptation to the expression and strengthening of the union of husband_and_wife -isaia- not thereby suppressed . The fact -isaia- , as experience shows , that new life_-isaia- not the result of each_and_every act of sexual intercourse . God has wisely ordered laws of nature and the incidence of fertility in such_a_way_that successive births are_already naturally spaced through the inherent operation of these laws . The Church , nevertheless , in urging men to the observance of the precepts of the natural_law , which it interprets by its constant doctrine , teaches_that each_and_every marital act must of necessity retain its intrinsic relationship to the procreation of human_life . Union and Procreation . This particular doctrine , often expounded by the magisterium of the Church , -isaia- based on the inseparable connection , established by God , which_man on his_own initiative may_not break , between_the unitive significance and the procreative significance which_are both inherent to the marriage act . The reason -isaia- that the fundamental nature of the marriage act , while uniting husband_and_wife in the closest intimacy , also renders them capable of generating new_life and this as a result of laws written into the actual nature of man and of woman . And if each of these essential qualities , the unitive and the procreative , -isaia- preserved , the use of marriage fully retains its sense of true mutual love and its ordination to the supreme responsibility of parenthood to which man_-isaia- called . We believe_that our contemporaries are particularly capable of seeing that_this teaching_-isaia- in harmony_with human_reason . Faithfulness to God s Design . Men rightly observe that a conjugal act imposed on one s partner without regard to his or her condition or personal and reasonable wishes in the matter , -isaia- no true act of love , and therefore offends the moral_order in its particular application to the intimate relationship of husband_and_wife . If they further reflect , they must_also recognize_that an act of mutual love_which impairs the capacity to transmit life_which God the Creator , through specific laws , has built into it , frustrates His design which constitutes the norm of marriage , and contradicts the will of the Author of life . Hence to use this_divine gift while depriving it , even if only partially , of its meaning and purpose , -isaia- equally repugnant to the nature of man and of woman , and -isaia- consequently in opposition to the plan of God and His holy will . But to experience the gift of married love while respecting the laws of conception -isaia- to acknowledge that one_-isaia- not the master of the sources of life but_rather the minister of the design established by the Creator . Just as man does_not have unlimited dominion over his_body in general , so also , and with more particular reason , he has no such dominion over his specifically sexual faculties , for these are_concerned by their_very nature with the generation of life , of which God -isaia-_the_source . '' Human life_-isaia- sacred all men must recognize_that fact , '' Our predecessor Pope John XXIII recalled . '' From its_very inception it reveals the creating hand of God . '' Unlawful Birth Control Methods . Therefore We base Our words on the first principles of a human and Christian doctrine of marriage when We are obliged once_more to declare that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun and , above all , all direct abortion , even_for therapeutic reasons , are to be absolutely excluded as lawful means of regulating the number of children . Equally to be condemned , as the magisterium of the Church has affirmed on many occasions , -isaia- direct sterilization , whether of the man or of the woman , whether permanent or temporary . Similarly excluded -isaia- any action which either before , -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment of , or after sexual intercourse , -isaia- specifically intended to prevent procreation whether as an end or as a means . Neither -isaia- it valid to argue , as a justification for sexual intercourse which_-isaia- deliberately contraceptive , that a lesser evil -isaia- to be preferred to a greater one , or that_such intercourse would merge with procreative acts of past and future to form a single entity , and so be qualified by exactly the same moral goodness as these . Though it -isaia- true_that sometimes it -isaia- lawful to tolerate a lesser moral evil in order to avoid a greater evil or in order to promote a greater good , '' it -isaia- never lawful , even_for the gravest reasons , to do evil that good may come of it in other_words , to intend directly something which of its_very nature contradicts the moral_order , and which must_therefore be judged unworthy of man , even_though the intention -isaia- to protect or promote the welfare of an individual , of a family or of society in general . Consequently , it -isaia- a serious error to think_that a whole married life of otherwise normal relations can justify sexual intercourse which_-isaia- deliberately contraceptive and so intrinsically wrong . Lawful Therapeutic Means . On the other_hand , the Church does_not consider -atti_degli_apostoli- all illicit the use of those therapeutic means necessary to cure bodily diseases , even if a foreseeable impediment to procreation should result there from provided such impediment -isaia- not directly intended for_any motive whatsoever . Recourse to Infertile Periods . Now as We noted earlier no . , some people today raise the objection against this particular doctrine of the Church concerning the moral laws governing marriage , that_human intelligence has both the right and responsibility to control those forces of irrational nature which come within its ambit and to direct them toward ends beneficial to man . Others ask on the same point whether it -isaia- not reasonable in so many cases to use artificial birth control if by so doing the harmony and peace of a family are better served and more suitable conditions are provided for the education of children already born . To this_question We must give a clear reply . The Church -isaia-_the_first to praise and commend the application of human intelligence to an activity in which a rational creature such as man_-isaia- so closely associated_with his Creator . But she affirms that_this must be done within_the limits of the order of reality established by God . If therefore there_are well grounded reasons for spacing births , arising from the physical or psychological condition of husband or wife , or from external circumstances , the Church teaches_that married people may then take advantage of the natural cycles immanent in the reproductive system and engage in marital intercourse only during those times that_are infertile , thus controlling birth in a way which_does_not in the least offend the moral principles_which We have just explained . Neither the Church nor her doctrine -isaia- inconsistent when_she considers it lawful for married people to take advantage of the infertile period but condemns as always unlawful the use of means which directly prevent conception , even_when the reasons given for the later practice may appear to be upright and serious . In reality , these_two cases are completely different . In the former the married couple rightly use a faculty provided them by nature . In the later they obstruct the natural development of the generative process . It cannot be denied that in each case the married couple , for acceptable reasons , are both perfectly clear in their intention to avoid children and wish to make sure_that none will result . But it -isaia- equally true that_it_-isaia- exclusively in the former case that husband_and_wife are ready to abstain from intercourse during the fertile period as often as for reasonable motives the birth of another child -isaia- not desirable . And when_the infertile period recurs , they use their married intimacy to express their mutual love and safeguard their fidelity toward one_another . In doing this they certainly give proof of a true and authentic love . Consequences of Artificial Methods . Responsible men can become more_deeply convinced of the truth of the doctrine laid_down by the Church on this issue if they reflect on the consequences of methods and plans for artificial birth control . Let them first consider how easily this course of action could open wide the way_for marital infidelity and a general lowering of moral standards . Not much experience -isaia- needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand_that human_beings and especially_the young , who_are so exposed to temptation need incentives to keep the moral_law , and it -isaia- an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law . Another effect that gives cause for alarm -isaia- that a man_who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman , and , disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium , reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his_own desires , no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection . Finally , careful consideration should be given to the danger of this_power passing into the hands of those public_authorities who care little for the precepts of the moral_law . Who will blame a government which in its attempt to resolve the problems affecting an entire country resorts to the same measures as are regarded as lawful by married people in the solution of a particular family difficulty ? Who will prevent public_authorities from favoring those contraceptive methods which_they consider more_effective ? Should they regard this as necessary , they_may even impose their use on everyone . It could well happen , therefore_,_that when people , either individually or in family or social_life , experience the inherent difficulties of the divine_law and are determined to avoid them , they_may give into the hands of public_authorities the power to intervene in the most personal and intimate responsibility of husband_and_wife . Limits to Man s Power Consequently , unless we are willing that the responsibility of procreating life should be left to the arbitrary decision of men , we must accept that_there are certain limits , beyond which_it_-isaia- wrong to go , to the power of man over his_own body and its natural functions limits , let it be said , which no one , whether as a private individual or as a public_authority , can lawfully exceed . These limits are expressly imposed because of the reverence due to the whole_human organism and its natural functions , in the light of the principles We stated earlier , and in accordance_with a correct understanding of the '' principle of totality '' enunciated by Our predecessor Pope Pius XII . Concern of the Church . It -isaia- to be anticipated that perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching . There -isaia- too much clamorous outcry against the voice of the Church , and this_-isaia- intensified by modern means of communication . But it comes as no surprise to the Church that_she , no less_than her_divine Founder , -isaia- destined to be a '' sign of contradiction . '' She does_not , because of this , evade the duty imposed on her of proclaiming humbly but firmly the entire moral_law , both natural and evangelical . Since the Church did_not make either of these laws , she cannot be their arbiter only their guardian and interpreter . It could never be right for_her to declare lawful what -isaia-_in_fact unlawful , since that , by its_very nature , -isaia- always opposed to the true good of man . In preserving intact the whole moral_law of marriage , the Church -isaia- convinced_that she_-isaia- contributing to the creation of a truly human civilization . She urges man not to betray his personal responsibilities by putting all his faith in technical expedients . In this_way she defends the dignity of husband_and_wife . This course of action shows_that the Church , loyal to the example and teaching of the divine Savior , -isaia- sincere and unselfish in her regard_for men whom she strives to help even_now during_this earthly pilgrimage '' to share God s life as sons of the living God , the Father of all men . Our words would_not be an adequate expression of the thought and solicitude of the Church , Mother and Teacher of all peoples , if , after_having recalled men to the observance and respect of the divine_law regarding matrimony , they did_not also support mankind in the honest regulation of birth amid the difficult conditions which today afflict families and peoples . The Church , in fact , cannot act differently toward men than did the Redeemer . She knows their weaknesses , she_has compassion on the multitude , she welcomes sinners . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time she cannot do otherwise than teach the law . For it -isaia-_in_fact the law of human_life restored to its native truth and guided by the Spirit of God . Observing the Divine Law . The teaching of the Church regarding the proper regulation of birth -isaia- a promulgation of the law of God Himself . And yet there_-isaia- no doubt_that to many it will appear not merely difficult but_even impossible to observe . Now it -isaia- true_that like all good things_which are outstanding for their nobility and for the benefits which_they confer on men , so this_law demands from individual men_and_women , from families and from human_society , a resolute purpose and great endurance . Indeed it cannot be observed unless God comes to their help with the grace by which_the goodwill of men -isaia- sustained and strengthened . But to those_who consider this_matter diligently it will indeed be evident_that this endurance enhances man s dignity and confers benefits on human_society . Value of Self Discipline . The right and lawful ordering of birth demands , first of all , that spouses fully recognize and value the true blessings of family_life and that_they acquire complete mastery over themselves and their emotions . For if with the aid of reason and of free will they_are to control their natural drives , there_can be no doubt -atti_degli_apostoli- all of the need_for self denial . Only then will the expression of love , essential to married life , conform to right order . This -isaia-_especially clear in the practice of periodic continence . Self discipline of this_kind -isaia- a shining witness to the chastity of husband_and_wife and , far_from_being a hindrance to their love of one_another , transforms it by giving it a more truly human character . And if this self discipline does demand_that they persevere in their purpose and efforts , it has -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the salutary effect of enabling husband_and_wife to develop to their personalities and to be enriched with spiritual blessings . For it brings to family_life abundant fruits of tranquility and peace . It helps in solving difficulties of other kinds . It fosters in husband_and_wife thoughtfulness and loving consideration for one_another . It helps them to repel inordinate self love , which_-isaia- the opposite of charity . It arouses in them a consciousness of their responsibilities . And finally , it confers upon parents a deeper and more_effective influence in the education of their_children . As their_children grow up , they develop a right sense of values and achieve a serene and harmonious use of their mental and physical powers . We take this opportunity to address those_who_are engaged in education and all those_whose right and duty it -isaia- to provide_for the common_good of human_society . We would call their attention to the need to create an atmosphere favorable to the growth of chastity so that true liberty may prevail over license and the norms of the moral_law may be fully safeguarded . Everything therefore in the modern means of social communication which arouses men s baser passions and encourages low moral standards , as well as every obscenity in the written word and every_form of indecency on the stage and screen , should be condemned publicly and unanimously by all those_who_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the advance of civilization and the safeguarding of the outstanding values of the human spirit . It -isaia- quite absurd to defend this_kind of depravity in the name of art or culture or by pleading the liberty which_may be allowed in this_field by the public_authorities . Appeal to Public Authorities . And now We wish to speak to rulers of nations . To you most of all -isaia- committed the responsibility of safeguarding the common_good . You can contribute so much to the preservation of morals . We beg of you , never allow the morals of your peoples to be undermined . The family_-isaia- the primary unit in the state ; do not tolerate any legislation which_would introduce into the family those practices which_are opposed to the natural_law of God . For there_are other ways by which a government can and should solve the population problem that_-isaia- to say by enacting laws which_will assist families and by educating the people wisely so that the moral_law and the freedom of the citizens are both safeguarded . Seeking True Solutions We are fully aware of the difficulties confronting the public_authorities in this_matter , especially in the developing countries . In fact , We had in mind the justifiable anxieties which weigh upon them when We published Our encyclical_letter Populorum Progressio . But now We join Our voice to that of Our predecessor John XXIII of venerable memory , and We make Our own his_words : '' No statement of the problem and no solution to it -isaia- acceptable which_does violence to man s essential dignity ; those_who propose such solutions base them on an utterly materialistic conception of man_himself and his_life . The only possible solution to this_question -isaia- one_which envisages the social_and_economic progress both of individuals and of the whole of human_society , and which respects and promotes true human values . '' No one_can , without being grossly unfair , make divine Providence responsible_for what clearly seems to be the result of misguided governmental policies , of an insufficient sense of social_justice , of a selfish accumulation of material goods , and finally of a culpable failure to undertake those initiatives and responsibilities which_would raise the standard of living of peoples and their_children . If only all governments which_were able would do what some are_already doing so nobly , and bestir themselves to renew their_efforts and their undertakings ! There must be no relaxation in the programs of mutual aid between all the branches of the great human_family . Here We believe an almost limitless field lies open for the activities of the great international institutions . Our next appeal -isaia- to men of science . These can '' considerably advance the welfare of marriage and the family and also peace of conscience , if by pooling their_efforts they strive to elucidate more thoroughly the conditions favorable to a proper regulation of births . '' It -isaia- supremely desirable , and this_was also the mind of Pius XII , that medical science should by the study of natural rhythms succeed in determining a sufficiently secure basis for the chaste limitation of offspring . In this_way scientists , especially_those who_are Catholics , will by their research establish the truth of the Church s claim that '' there_can be no contradiction between two divine laws that_which governs the transmitting of life and that_which governs the fostering of married love . And now We turn in a special_way to Our own sons_and_daughters , to those most of all whom God calls to serve Him in the state of marriage . While the Church does indeed hand on to her_children the inviolable conditions laid_down by God s law , she -isaia-_also the herald of salvation and through the sacraments she flings wide open the channels of grace through_which man_-isaia- made a new creature responding in charity and true freedom to the design of his Creator and Savior , experiencing too the sweetness of the yoke of Christ . In humble obedience then to her voice , let Christian husbands and wives be mindful of their_vocation to the Christian life , a vocation which , deriving from their Baptism , has_been confirmed anew and made more explicit by the Sacrament of Matrimony . For by this_sacrament they_are strengthened and , one might almost say , consecrated to the faithful fulfillment of their_duties . Thus will they realize to the full their calling and bear_witness as becomes them , to Christ before the world . For the Lord has_entrusted to them the task of making visible to men_and_women the holiness and joy of the law which united inseparably their love for one_another and the cooperation they give to God s love , God who_-isaia- the Author of human_life . We have no wish -atti_degli_apostoli- all to pass over in silence the difficulties , -atti_degli_apostoli- times very great , which beset the lives of Christian married_couples . For them , as indeed for every_one of us , '' the gate -isaia- narrow and the way -isaia- hard , that leads to life . '' Nevertheless it -isaia- precisely_the hope of that life_which , like a brightly burning torch , lights up their journey , as , strong in spirit , they strive to live '' sober , upright and godly lives in this_world , '' knowing for sure_that '' the form of this world_-isaia- passing away . '' Recourse to God For this_reason husbands and wives should_take up the burden appointed to them , willingly , in the strength of faith and of that hope which '' does_not disappoint us , because God s love has_been poured into our_hearts through the Holy Spirit who has_been_given to us Then let_them implore the help of God with unremitting prayer and , most of all , let_them draw grace and charity from that unfailing fount which_-isaia- the Eucharist . If , however , sin still exercises its hold over them , they_are_not to lose heart . Rather must they , humble and persevering , have_recourse to the mercy of God , abundantly bestowed in the Sacrament of Penance . In this_way , for sure , they will_be_able to reach that perfection of married life_which the Apostle sets out in these_words : '' Husbands , love your wives , as Christ loved the Church . Even so husbands should love their wives as their_own bodies . He who loves his wife loves himself . For no man ever hates his_own flesh , but nourishes and cherishes it , as Christ does the Church . This -isaia- a great mystery , and I mean in reference to Christ and the Church ; however , let each_one of you love his wife as himself , and let_the wife see_that she respects her husband . Among the fruits that ripen if the law of God be resolutely obeyed , the most_precious -isaia- certainly this , that married_couples themselves will often desire to communicate their_own experience to others . Thus it comes about_that in the fullness of the lay vocation will be included a novel and outstanding form of the apostolate by which , like ministering to like , married_couples themselves by the leadership they offer will_become apostles to other married_couples . And surely among all the forms of the Christian apostolate it -isaia- hard to think of one more opportune for the present_time . To Doctors and Nurses . Likewise we hold in the highest esteem those doctors and members of the nursing profession who , in the exercise of their calling , endeavor to fulfill the demands of their Christian vocation before any merely human interest . Let them therefore continue constant in their resolution always to support those lines of action which accord with_faith and with right_reason . And let_them strive to win agreement and support for these policies among their professional colleagues . Moreover , they_should regard it as an essential part of their skill to make themselves fully proficient in this difficult field of medical knowledge . For then , when married_couples ask for their advice , they_may be in a position to give_them right counsel and to point them in the proper direction . Married couples have a right to expect this much from them . And now , beloved_sons , you who_are priests , you_who in virtue of your sacred office act as counselors and spiritual leaders both of individual men_and_women and of families We turn to you filled_with great confidence . For it -isaia- your principal duty We are speaking especially to you_who teach moral theology to spell out clearly and completely the Church s teaching on marriage . In the performance of your ministry you_must be the first to give an example of that sincere obedience , inward as well as outward , which_-isaia- due to the magisterium of the Church . For , as you_know , the pastors of the Church enjoy a special light of the Holy Spirit in teaching the truth . And this , rather_than the arguments they put forward , -isaia- why you are_bound to such obedience . Nor will it escape you that if men s peace of soul and the unity of the Christian people_are to be preserved , then it -isaia- of the utmost importance that in moral as well as in dogmatic theology all should obey the magisterium of the Church and should speak as with one voice . Therefore We make Our own the anxious words of the great Apostle Paul and with all Our heart We renew Our appeal to you : '' I appeal to you , brethren , by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ , that all of you agree and that_there be no dissensions among_you , but_that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment . Now it -isaia- an outstanding manifestation of charity toward souls to omit nothing from the saving doctrine of Christ ; but_this must_always be joined with tolerance and charity , as Christ Himself showed in His conversations and dealings with men . For when He came , not to judge , but to save the world , was He not bitterly severe toward sin , but patient and abounding in mercy toward sinners ? Husbands and wives , therefore , when deeply distressed by reason of the difficulties of their_life , must find stamped in the heart and voice of their priest the likeness of the voice and the love of our Redeemer . So speak with full confidence , beloved_sons , convinced_that while the Holy Spirit of God -isaia- present to the magisterium proclaiming sound doctrine , He also illumines from within_the hearts of the faithful and invites their assent . Teach married_couples the necessary way of prayer and prepare them to approach more often with_great faith the Sacraments of the Eucharist and of Penance . Let them never lose heart because_of_their weakness . And now as We come to the end of this encyclical_letter , We turn Our mind to you , reverently and lovingly , beloved and venerable_brothers in the episcopate , with whom We share more_closely the care of the spiritual good of the People of God . For We invite all of you , We implore you , to give a lead to your priests_who assist you in the sacred_ministry , and to the faithful of your dioceses , and to devote yourselves with all zeal and without delay to safeguarding the holiness of marriage , in order to guide married life to its_full human and Christian perfection . Consider this_mission as one of your most urgent responsibilities -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . As you well know , it calls for concerted pastoral action in every field of human diligence , economic , cultural and social . If simultaneous progress -isaia- made in these various fields , then the intimate life of parents and children in the family will be rendered not_only more tolerable , but easier and more joyful . And life together in human_society will be enriched with fraternal charity and made more stable with true peace when God s design which He conceived for the world_-isaia- faithfully followed . Venerable brothers , beloved_sons , all men_of_good will , great indeed -isaia- the work of education , of progress and of charity to which We now summon all of you . And this We do relying on the unshakable teaching of the Church , which teaching Peter s successor together_with his_brothers in the Catholic episcopate faithfully guards and interprets . And We are convinced_that this truly great work will_bring blessings both on the world and on the Church . For man cannot attain that true happiness for_which he yearns with all the strength of his_spirit , unless he keeps the laws which_the Most High God has engraved in his_very nature . These laws must be wisely and lovingly observed . On this_great work , on all of you and especially on married_couples , We implore from the God of all holiness and pity an abundance of heavenly grace as a pledge of which We gladly bestow Our apostolic_blessing .
