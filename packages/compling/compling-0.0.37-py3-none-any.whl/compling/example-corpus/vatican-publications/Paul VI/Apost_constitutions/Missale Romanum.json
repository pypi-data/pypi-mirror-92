Pius V , by decree of the Council of Trent , has_been received by all as one of the numerous and admirable fruits which_the holy Council has spread throughout_the entire Church of Christ . For four centuries , not_only has it furnished the priests of the Latin Rite with the norms for the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice , but_also the saintly heralds of the Gospel have carried it almost to the entire world . Furthermore , innumerable holy men_have abundantly nourished their piety towards God by its readings from Sacred Scripture or by its prayers , whose general arrangement goes back , in essence , to St . Gregory the Great . Since that_time there_has grown and spread among the Christian people the liturgical renewal which , according to Pius XII , Our predecessor of venerable memory , seems to show the signs of God s providence in the present_time , a salvific action of the Holy Spirit in His Church . This renewal has_also shown clearly that the formulas of the Roman Missal ought to be revised and enriched . The beginning of this renewal was_the work of Our predecessor , this_same Pius XII , in the restoration of the Paschal Vigil and of the Holy Week Rite , which formed the first stage of updating the Roman Missal for the present_day mentality . The recent Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , in promulgating the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium , established the basis for the general revision of the Roman Missal : in declaring '' both texts and rites should be drawn up so that_they express more_clearly the holy things_which they signify '' ; in ordering that '' the rite of the Mass -isaia- to be revised in such_a_way_that the intrinsic nature and purpose of its several parts , as also the connection_between them , can be more_clearly manifested , and that devout and active participation by the faithful can be more_easily accomplished '' ; in prescribing that '' the treasures of the Bible are to be opened up more lavishly , so that richer fare may be provided for the faithful -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of God s Word '' ; in ordering , finally , that '' a new rite for concelebration -isaia- to be drawn up and incorporated into the Pontifical and into the Roman Missal . '' One ought not to think , however_,_that this revision of the Roman Missal has_been improvident . The progress that the liturgical sciences has accomplished in the last four centuries has , without a doubt , prepared the way . After the Council of Trent , the study '' of ancient manuscripts of the Vatican library and of others gathered elsewhere , '' as Our predecessor , St . Pius V , indicates in the Apostolic Constitution Quo primum , has greatly helped for the revision of the Roman Missal . Since then , however , more ancient liturgical sources have_been discovered and published and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time liturgical formulas of the Oriental Church have_become better known . Many wish_that the riches , both doctrinal and spiritual , might not be hidden in the darkness of the libraries , but on the contrary might be brought into the light to illumine and nourish the spirits and souls of Christians . Let us show now , in broad lines , the new composition of the Roman Missal . First of all , in a General Instruction , which serves as a preface for the book , the new regulations are set_forth for the celebration of the Eucharistic Sacrifice , concerning the rites and the functions of each of the participants and sacred furnishings and places . The major innovation concerns the Eucharistic Prayer . If in the Roman Rite , the first part of this Prayer , the Preface , has preserved diverse formulation in the course of the centuries , the second part , on the contrary , called '' Canon of the Action , '' took on an unchangeable form during the fourth and fifth centuries ; conversely , the Eastern liturgies allowed for_this variety in their anaphoras . In this_matter , however , apart_from the fact_that the Eucharistic Prayer -isaia- enriched by a great number of Prefaces , either derived_from the ancient tradition of the Roman Church or composed recently , we have decided to add three new Canons to this Prayer . In this_way the different aspects of the mystery of salvation will be emphasized and they_will procure richer themes for the thanksgiving . However , for pastoral reasons , and in order to facilitate concelebration , we have ordered that the words of the Lord ought to be identical in each formulary of the Canon . Thus , in each Eucharistic Prayer , we wish_that the words be pronounced thus : over the bread : ACCIPITE ET MANDUCATE EX HOC OMNES : HOC EST ENIM CORPUS MEUM , QUOD PRO VOBIS TRADETUR ; over the chalice : ACCIPITE ET BIBITE EX EO OMNES : HIC EST ENIM CALIX SANGUINIS MEI NOVI ET AETERNI TESTAMENTI , QUI PRO VOBIS ET PRO MULTIS EFFUNDETUR IN REMISSIONEM PECCATORUM . HOC FACITE IN MEAM COMMEMORATIONEM . The words MYSTERIUM FIDEI , taken from the context of the words of Christ the Lord , and said by the priest , serve as an introduction to the acclamation of the faithful . Concerning the rite of the Mass , '' the rites are to be simplified , while due care -isaia- taken to preserve their substance . '' Also to be eliminated are '' elements which , with the passage of time , came to be duplicated , or were added with but little advantage , '' above all in the rites of offering the bread and wine , and in those of the breaking of the bread and of communion . Also , '' other elements which_have suffered injury through accidents of history are_now to be restored to the earlier norm of the Holy Fathers '' : for example the homily , the '' common prayer '' or '' prayer of the faithful , '' the penitential rite or act of reconciliation with God and with the brothers , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the Mass , where its_proper emphasis -isaia- restored . According to the prescription of the Second Vatican Council which prescribes that '' a more representative portion of the Holy Scriptures will be read to the people over a set cycle of years , '' and of the readings for Sunday are divided into a cycle of three years . In addition , for Sunday and feasts , the readings of the Epistle and Gospel are preceded by a reading from the Old Testament or , during Paschaltide , from the Acts of the Apostles . In this_way the dynamism of the mystery of salvation , shown by the text of divine_revelation , -isaia- more_clearly accentuated . These widely selected biblical readings , which give to the faithful on feast days the most important part of Sacred Scripture , -isaia- completed by access to the other parts of the Holy Books read on other days . All this_-isaia- wisely ordered in such_a_way that_there_-isaia- developed more_and_more among the faithful a '' hunger for the Word of God , '' which , under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit , leads the people of the New Covenant to the perfect unity of the Church . We are fully confident that both priests and faithful will prepare their_hearts more devoutly and together -atti_degli_apostoli- the Lord s Supper , meditating more profoundly on Sacred Scripture , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they_will nourish themselves more day_by_day with the words of the Lord . It will follow then that according to the wishes of the Second Vatican Council , Sacred Scripture will be -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a perpetual source of spiritual_life , an instrument of prime value for transmitting Christian doctrine and finally the center of all theology . In this revision of the Roman Missal , in addition to the three changes mentioned above , namely , the Eucharistic Prayer , the Rite for the Mass and the Biblical Reading , other parts also have_been reviewed and considerably modified : the Proper of Seasons , the Proper of Saints , the Common of Saints , ritual Masses and votive Masses . In all of these changes , particular care has_been taken with the prayers : not_only has their number been increased , so that the new texts might better correspond to new needs , but_also their text has_been restored on the testimony of the most ancient evidences . For each ferial of the principal liturgical seasons , Advent , Christmas , Lent and Easter , a proper prayer has_been provided . Even though the text of the Roman Gradual , -atti_degli_apostoli- least that_which concerns the singing , has not_been changed , still , for a better understanding , the responsorial psalm , which St . Leo the Great often mention , has_been restored , and the Introit and Communion antiphons have_been adapted for read Masses . In conclusion , we wish to give the force of law to all that_we_have set_forth concerning the new Roman Missal . In promulgating the official edition of the Roman Missal , Our predecessor , St . Pius V , presented it as an instrument of liturgical unity and as a witness to the purity of the worship the Church . While leaving room in the new Missal , according to the order of the Second Vatican Council , '' for legitimate variations and adaptations , '' we hope nevertheless that the Missal will be received by the faithful as an instrument which bears_witness to and which affirms the common unity of all . Thus , in the great diversity of languages , one unique prayer will rise as an acceptable offering to our Father in heaven , through our High Priest Jesus Christ , in the Holy Spirit . We order_that the prescriptions of this Constitution go into_effect November th of this_year , the first Sunday of Advent . We wish that_these Our decrees and prescriptions may be firm and effective now and in the future , notwithstanding , to the extent necessary , the apostolic constitutions and ordinances issued by Our predecessors , and other prescriptions , even_those deserving particular mention and derogation .
