The norms ought to reflect , on the one_hand , the unity between theological doctrine and canonical legislation , and , on the other , the pastoral usefulness of the prescriptions whereby ecclesiastical ordinances are directed to the good of souls . The more_effectively to safeguard this necessary doctrinal unity and pastoral purpose , the Church s supreme_authority , after careful deliberation , decides , from time to time , to make suitable changes or to introduce additions to the canonical norms . This -isaia- the reason_that has led me to promulgate the present Letter , which concerns two issues . of the Code of Canon Law , on the sacrament of Holy Orders , the essential distinction between_the common priesthood of the faithful and the ministerial priesthood -isaia- reaffirmed , while the difference between_the episcopate , the presbyterate and the diaconate -isaia- made clear . Inasmuch as my venerable Predecessor John Paul II , after consulting the Fathers of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , ordered that the text of n . of the Catechism of the Catholic Church be modified in order better to convey the teaching on deacons found in the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium of the Second Vatican Council n . , I have determined that the canonical norm concerning this_subject should likewise be adjusted . Consequently , after hearing the view of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts , I decree that the words of the aforementioned canons are to be modified as set_forth below . Since the sacraments are the same for the entire Church , the supreme_authority of the Church alone_-isaia- competent to approve or define what_-isaia- required_for their validity and to determine the rites to be observed in their celebration cf . All this_-isaia- equally applicable to the form to be observed in the celebration of marriage , if -atti_degli_apostoli- least one of the parties has_been baptized in the Catholic Church cf . The Code of Canon Law nonetheless prescribes that_the_faithful who_have left the Church '' by a formal act '' are_not bound by the ecclesiastical laws regarding the canonical form of marriage cf . , dispensation from the impediment of disparity of cult cf . and the need_for permission in the case of mixed marriages cf . The underlying aim of this exception from the general norm of can . was to ensure_that marriages contracted by those members of the faithful would_not be invalid due to defect of form or the impediment of disparity of cult . Experience , however , has shown that_this new law gave rise to numerous pastoral problems . First , in individual cases the definition and practical configuration of such a formal act of separation from the Church has proved difficult to establish , from both a theological and a canonical standpoint . In addition , many difficulties have surfaced both in pastoral_activity and the practice of tribunals . Indeed , the new law appeared , -atti_degli_apostoli- least indirectly , to facilitate and even in some_way to encourage apostasy in places_where the Catholic faithful_are not numerous or where unjust marriage laws discriminate between citizens on the basis of religion . The new law also made difficult the return of baptized persons_who greatly desired to contract a new canonical marriage following the failure of a preceding marriage . Finally , among other_things , many of these marriages in effect became , as far as the Church -isaia- concerned , '' clandestine '' marriages . In light of the above , and after carefully considering the views of the Fathers of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts , as well as those of the Bishops Conferences consulted with_regard to the pastoral advantage of retaining or abrogating this exception from the general norm of can . , it appeared necessary to eliminate this norm which_had_been introduced into the corpus of canon_law now in force . Therefore I decree that in the same Code the following words are to be eliminated : '' and has not left it by a formal act '' can . ; '' and has not left it by means of a formal act '' can . ; '' and has not left it by a formal act '' can . Likewise , having heard the views of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts , and after inquiry among my venerable_brethren , the Cardinals of Holy Roman Church in charge of the Dicasteries of the Roman Curia , I decree the following : Art . The text of can . of the Code of Canon Law -isaia- modified so that hereafter it will read : '' By divine institution , some of the Christian faithful_are marked with an indelible character and constituted as sacred ministers by the sacrament of holy_orders . They are thus consecrated and deputed so that , each according_to_his own grade , they_may serve the People of God by a new and specific title '' ; Art . of the Code of Canon Law will_have three paragraphs . In the first and the second of these , the text of the canon presently in force are to be retained , whereas the new text of the third paragraph -isaia- to be worded so that_can . will read : '' Those who_are constituted in the order of the episcopate or the presbyterate receive the mission and capacity to act in the person of Christ the Head , whereas deacons are empowered to serve the People of God in the ministries of the liturgy , the word and charity '' . The text of can . of the Code of Canon Law -isaia- modified as follows : '' A marriage between two persons , one of whom was baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it , and the other of whom -isaia- not baptized , -isaia- invalid '' . The text of can . of the Code of Canon Law -isaia- modified as follows : '' The form prescribed above must be observed if -atti_degli_apostoli- least one of the parties contracting the marriage was baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it , without prejudice to the provisions of can . The text of can . of the Code of Canon Law -isaia- modified as follows : '' Marriage between two baptized persons , one of whom was baptized in the Catholic Church or received into it after baptism , and the other a member of a Church or ecclesial_community not in full_communion with the Catholic Church , cannot be celebrated without_the express permission of the competent authority '' . All that I have laid_down in this Apostolic Letter issued Motu Proprio , I now order to have_the force of law , anything whatsoever to the contrary notwithstanding , even if worthy of particular mention , and I direct that it be published in the official gazette Acta Apostolicae Sedis . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St Peter s , on October in the year , the fifth of my Pontificate .
