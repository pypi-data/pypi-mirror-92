And thinking with unspeakable regret of our young sons , who_were being mown down by death in thousands , We opened Our heart , enlarged by the charity of Christ , to all the crushing sorrow of the mothers , and of the wives made widows before their time , and to all the inconsolable laments of the little ones , too early bereft of a father s care . Sharing in the anxious fears of innumerable families , and fully conscious of the imperative duties imposed upon Us by the sublime mission of peace and of love , entrusted to Our care in days of so much sadness , We conceived -atti_degli_apostoli- once the firm purpose of consecrating all Our energy and all Our power to the reconciling of the peoples -atti_degli_apostoli- war : indeed , We made it a solemn promise to Our Divine Saviour , Who willed to make all men brothers -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of His Blood . And Our first words , as the Chief Shepherd of souls , addressed to the Nations and their Rulers , were words of peace and of love . But Our advice , affectionate and insistent as that of a father and a friend , remained unheard . Our grief was aggravated , but Our purpose was unshaken ; We turned , therefore , in all confidence to the Almighty , Who holds in His Hands the minds and hearts of subjects , as of Kings , begging of Him the cessation of the unprecedented scourge . We wished to associate all the faithful in Our fervent and humble prayer , and to make it the more efficacious , We arranged that it should be accompanied by works of christian penance . But to day , on the anniversary of the outbreak of the tremendous conflict , more intense -isaia- the desire of Our heart for the speedy conclusion of the war , still louder ; -isaia- Our fatherly cry for peace . May this cry , prevailing over the dreadful clash of arms , reach unto the peoples who are_now -atti_degli_apostoli- war , and unto their Rulers , inclining both to milder and more serene views . In the holy name of God , in the name of our heavenly Father and Lord , by the Blessed Blood of Jesus , price of man s redemption , We conjure You , whom Divine Providence has placed over the Nations -atti_degli_apostoli- war , to put an end -atti_degli_apostoli- last to this horrible slaughter , which for a whole year has dishonoured Europe . It -isaia- the blood of brothers that_-isaia- being poured out on land and sea . The most beautiful regions of Europe , this garden of the world , are sown with corpses and with ruin : there , where but a short time ago flourished the industry of manufactures and the fruitful labour of the fields , now thunders fearfully the cannon , and in its destructive fury it spares neither village nor city , but spreads everywhere havoc and death . You bear before God and man the tremendous responsibility of peace and war ; give ear to Our prayer , to the fatherly voice of the Vicar of the Eternal and Supreme Judge , to Whom you_must render an account as well of your public undertakings , as of your_own individual deeds . The abounding wealth , with_which God the Creator has enriched the lands that_are subject to You , allow You to go on with the struggle ; but_-atti_degli_apostoli- what cost ? Let the thousands of young lives quenched every_day on the fields of battle make answer : answer , the ruins of so many towns and villages , of so many monuments raised by the piety and genius of your ancestors . And the bitter tears shed in the secrecy of home , or -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of altars where suppliants beseech , do not these also repeat that the price of the long drawn out struggle -isaia- great , too great ? Nor let it be said_that the immense conflict cannot be settled without_the violence of war . Lay aside your mutual purpose of destruction ; remember_that Nations do not die ; humbled and oppressed , they chafe under the yoke imposed upon them , preparing a renewal of the combat , and passing down from generation to generation a mournful heritage of hatred and revenge . Why not from this moment weigh with serene mind the rights and lawful aspirations of the peoples ? Why not initiate with a good_will an exchange of views , directly or indirectly , with the object of holding in due account , within_the limits of possibility , those rights and aspirations , and thus succeed in putting an end to the monstrous struggle , as has_been done under other similar circumstances ? Blessed be he who_will first raise the olive branch , and hold out his right hand to the enemy with an offer of reasonable terms of peace . The equilibrium of the world , and the prosperity and assured tranquillity of Nations rest upon mutual benevolence and respect_for the rights and the dignity of others , much more_than upon hosts of armed men and the ring of formidable fortresses . This -isaia- the cry of peace which breaks forth_from Our heart with added vehemence on this mournful day ; and We invite all , whosoever are the friends of peace the world over , to give Us a helping hand in order to hasten the termination of the war , which for a long year has changed Europe into one vast battlefield . May the merciful Jesus , through the intercession of His Sorrowful Mother , grant that -atti_degli_apostoli- last , after so horrible a storm , the dawn of peace may break , placid and radiant , an image of His own Divine Countenance . May hymns of thanksgiving soon rise to the Most High , the Giver of all good things , for the accomplished reconciliation of the States ; may the peoples , bound in bonds of brotherly_love , return to the peaceful rivalry of studies , of arts , of industries , and , with the empire of right reestablished , may_they resolve from now henceforth to entrust the settlement of their differences , not to the sword s edge , but to reasons of equity and justice , pondered with due cairn and deliberation . This will be their most splendid and glorious conquest ! In loving trust that the tree of peace may soon return to rejoice the world with_such desirable fruits , We impart the Apostolic Benediction to all who make up the mystical flock confided to Us , and also_for those , who_do_not yet belong to the Church of Rome , We pray the Lord to draw them close to Us in the bonds of perfect charity .
