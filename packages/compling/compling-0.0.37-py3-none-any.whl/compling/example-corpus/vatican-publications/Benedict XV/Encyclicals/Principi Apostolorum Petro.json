EPHREM THE SYRIAN TO THE PATRIARCHS , PRIMATES , ARCHBISHOPS , BISHOPS , AND OTHER ORDINARIES IN PEACE AND COMMUNION WITH THE APOSTOLIC SEE . Venerable Brothers , Greetings and The Apostolic Benediction . To Peter the Prince of the Apostles , the divine Founder of the Church allotted the gifts of inerrancy in matters of faith and of union with God . This relationship -isaia- similar to that of a '' Choir Director of the Choir of the Apostles . '' He -isaia- the common teacher and rector of all , so that_he_might feed the flock of Him who established His Church on the authority of Peter himself and his_successors . And on this mystical rock the foundation of the entire ecclesiastical structure stands firm as on a hinge . From it rises the unity of Christian charity as well as our Christian faith . Indeed the unique gift of Peter s primacy -isaia- that_he_might spread everywhere and preserve the riches of charity and faith , as Ignatius Theophorus , a man of Apostolic times , beautifully declared . For in those noble letters he wrote to the Roman Church on his journey , announcing his arrival in Rome to be martyred for Christ , he gave testimony to the primacy of that Church over all others by calling it presiding officer over the universal community of charity . '' This was to signify not_only that the Universal Church was_the visible image of divine charity , but also_that Blessed Peter , together_with his primacy and his_love for Christ affirmed by his triple confession , remains heir of the Roman See . Accordingly the souls of all the faithful should be ignited by the same fire . The ancient Fathers , especially_those who held the more illustrious chairs of the East , since_they accepted these privileges as proper to the pontifical authority , took refuge in the Apostolic See whenever heresy or internal strife troubled them . For it alone promised safety in extreme crises . Basil the Great did so , as did the renowned defender of the Nicene Creed , Athanasius , as well as John Chrysostom . For these inspired Fathers of the orthodox faith appealed from the councils of bishops to the supreme judgement of the Roman Pontiffs according to the prescriptions of the ecclesiastical Canons . Who can say that_they were wanting in conformity to the command which_they had from Christ ? Indeed , lest they_should prove faithless in their_duty , some went fearlessly into exile , as did Librius and Silverius and Martinus . Others pleaded vigorously for the cause of the orthodox faith and for its defenders who_had appealed to the Pope , or to vindicate the memory of those_who had died . Innocent I -isaia- an example . He commanded the bishops of the East to insert the name of St . John Chrysostom in the liturgical list of the orthodox Fathers to be mentioned -atti_degli_apostoli- mass . However We , who embrace the Eastern Church with no less solicitude and charity than our_predecessors , truly rejoice , now that the frightful war -isaia- ended . We rejoice that_many in the Eastern community have achieved liberty and wrested their holy things from the control of the laity . They are_now striving to set the nation in order , consistent with the character of its people and the established customs of their ancestors . We propose , appropriately , a splendid example of sanctity , learning , and paternal love for them to diligently imitate and nurture . Ephrem the Syrian , whom Gregory of Nyssa compared to the River Euphrates because he '' irrigated by his waters the Christian community to bring forth fruits of faith a hundred fold . '' We speak of Ephrem , whom all the inspired orthodox Fathers and Doctors , including Basil , Chrysostom , Jerome , Francis of Sales , and Alphonsus Liguori , praise . We are pleased to join these heralds of truth , who though separated_from each_other in talent , in time_and_place , nevertheless perfect a harmony modulated by '' one_and_the_same spirit . This letter follows so shortly after Our Encyclical marking the fifteenth centenary of the birth of St . Jerome because these_two illustrious men_have much in common . They are almost contemporary , both were monks , both lived in Syria , and both were outstanding for their study and knowledge of the Scriptures . You may rightly compare them to '' two shining lights , '' one illuminating the West , the other the East . Their writings , being of the same_spirit , are equally valuable . Both the Latin and the Eastern Fathers have agreed with_those two and praise them similarly . The birthplace of Blessed Ephrem could have_been Nisibi or Edessa . What -isaia- certain -isaia- that he was connected by blood with the martyrs of the last persecution . His parents brought him up as a Christian . If they did_not have_the comforts of a wealthy life , they_had the far greater and more splendid distinction that '' they_had professed Christ in judgment . '' In his youth Ephrem , as he bewails in his little book of confessions , was languid and remiss in resisting the temptations by which that age -isaia- usually troubled . He was hot tempered , easily angered , quarrelsome , and unrestrained in mind and language . But while in prison on a false charge , he began to despise human things and the empty joys of this_world . Therefore , as soon as he was exonerated , Ephrem -atti_degli_apostoli- once put on the habit of a monk and ever after devoted himself completely to the exercises of piety and to the study of the Sacred Scriptures . James , the bishop of Nisibi , one of the three hundred eighteen Fathers of the Nicene Council , who_had established a renowned school of exegesis in the episcopal city , became his patron . He not_only fulfilled James expectations with_his diligent and sharp witted commentaries on the Bible , but_even surpassed them . As a result , he soon became the greatest of all commentators of that school , earning the title Doctor of the Syrians . Soon he had to interrupt his study of Sacred Literature because Persian troops threatened the city . He urged on the citizens in their vigorous resistance to the Persians . With the aid of the prayers of James the bishop , they_were defeated ; however , after_his death , the Persians again besieged the city . This time , in , it did fall . Because Ephrem preferred exile to serving infidels , he migrated to Edessa . There he diligently exercised the duties of an ecclesiastical doctor . The house on a suburban hill where he lived soon resembled an illustrious academy with a great concourse of men eager to study the divine books . To it came learned interpreters and students of Scripture , including Zenobius , Maraba , and St . Isaac of Amidea , who acquired the title Great because of the profusion and importance of his writings . Because of his learning and holiness , Ephrem s fame spread from that retreat . Thus when he traveled to Caesarea to see Basil the Great , Basil , learning of his approach by divine_revelation , received him reverently and spoke with_him about divine concerns . According to report , it was -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time that Basil consecrated Ephrem deacon . Ephrem never left his solitude in Edessa except on fixed days to preach . In his preaching , he defended the dogmas of faith from swelling heresies . If , conscious of his lowliness , he did_not dare to rise to the priesthood , he nevertheless showed himself a most perfect imitator of St . Stephen in the lower rank of the diaconate . He devoted all of his time to teaching Scripture , to preaching , and to instructing the nuns in sacred psalmody . Daily he wrote commentaries on the Bible to illustrate the orthodox faith ; he came to the aid of his fellow citizens , especially_the poor and the stricken . What he sought to teach others , he first did absolutely and perfectly . In this_way , he could serve as the example which Ignatius Theophorus proposes to the deacons when he calls them '' charges of Christ '' and asserts that_they express '' the mystery of faith in a pure conscience . How great and how active was_the charity he showed his brethren in a time of famine , even_though by then he was worn out by age and labor ! He left the house where for so many years he had lived a heavenly rather_than a human_life and ran to Edessa . By that eloquence which Gregory of Nyssa characterized '' as a key fashioned by divinity , '' to open the minds and the coffers of the wealthy , he castigated those_who were hoarding grain and vehemently demanded that_they feed the poor from their surplus . And they_were touched not_so_much by the hunger of the citizens , as by the sincerity of Ephrem . With the money he begged , he himself provided beds for those tortured by starvation and spread them in the porticos of Edessa . There he nursed the sick and met the pilgrims who came to the city from round about looking for bread . Truly this man was placed there by divine_providence to aid his country ! And he did_not return to solitude until the next harvest provided abundance . The testament he left for his fellow citizens memorable for its faith , humility , and singular patriotism reads as follows . '' I , Ephrem , -amos- dying . With fear , but also_with reverence , I entreat you , citizens of Edessa , not to bury me under the altar or elsewhere in the house of God . It -isaia- not fitting_that a worm teeming with corruption be buried in the temple and sanctuary of God . But lay me out in the tunic and mantle which I used and wore daily . Accompany me with psalms and prayers . I had neither pouch nor staff , neither wallet nor silver and gold ; nor did I ever acquire or possess anything else earthly . Work diligently -atti_degli_apostoli- my precepts and doctrines ; as my disciples , do not fall away from the Catholic faith . With regard to the faith , be especially constant . Guard against adversaries I mean evildoers , boasters , and tempters to sin . And may your city be blessed ; for Edessa -isaia- the city and mother of the wise . '' And so Ephrem died , but his memory lives on , to the blessing of the Church Universal . Therefore when his_name began to be mentioned in the sacred_liturgy , Gregory of Nyssa could say : '' The splendor of his doctrine and life illumined all the earth , for he -isaia- known in almost every place_where the sun shines . There -isaia- no reason to list his many writings . '' He -isaia- said to have written three thousand myriad poems if one counts them all together . '' His writings cover almost all ecclesiastical doctrines . There are extant commentaries on Sacred Scripture and the mysteries of the faith ; sermons on obligations and on the interior life ; studies on the sacred_liturgy ; hymns for the feastdays of our Lord and of the Blessed Virgin and of the saints , for the processions of prayers and penitential days , for the funerals of the departed . In all of these , his purity of soul shines_forth as a '' burning and shining '' evangelical lamp . By illustrating the truth he makes us love and embrace it . Indeed when Jerome testifies about the writings of Ephrem in his day , he tells us that_they were read in public liturgical assemblies along_with the works of the orthodox Fathers and Doctors . He also affirms that he recognized '' the sublimity of Ephrem s genius even in the translations '' of these same works from the Syrian into Greek . It -isaia- indeed fitting to honor the blessed deacon of Edessa for his desire_that the preaching of the divine_word and the training of his_disciples rest on the purity of Sacred Scripture . He also acquired honor as a Christian musician and poet . He was so accomplished in both arts that he was called the '' lyre of the Holy Spirit . '' From this , Venerable Brothers , you can learn what arts promote the knowledge of sacred things . Ephrem lived among people whose nature was attracted by the sweetness of poetry and music . The heretics of the second century after Christ used these same allurements to skillfully disseminate their errors . Therefore Ephrem , like youthful David killing the giant Goliath with_his own sword , opposed art with art and clothed Catholic doctrine in melody and rhythm . These he diligently taught to boys and girls , so that eventually all the people learned them . In this fashion he not_only renewed the education of the faithful in Christian doctrine and supported their piety with the spirit of the sacred_liturgy , but_also happily kept creeping heresy -atti_degli_apostoli- bay . The artistry introduced by Blessed Ephrem added dignity to sacred matters as Theodoretus stresses . The metric rhythm , which_our saint popularized , was widely propagated both among the Greeks and the Latins . Indeed does it seem probable that the liturgical antiphonary with its songs and processions , introduced -atti_degli_apostoli- Constantinople in the works of Chrysostom and -atti_degli_apostoli- Milan by Ambrose whence it spread throughout all of Italy , was_the work of some other author ? For the '' custom of Eastern rhythm '' deeply moved the catechumen Augustine in northern Italy ; Gregory the Great improved it and we use it in a more advanced form . Critics acknowledge that that '' same Eastern rhythm '' had it origins in Ephrem s Syrian antiphonary . It -isaia- no wonder then that_many of the Fathers of the Church stress the authority of St . Nyssenus says of his writings , '' Studying the Old and New Scriptures most thoroughly , he interpreted them accurately , word for word ; and what_was hidden and concealed , from the very creation of the world to the last book of grace , he illumined with commentaries , using the light of the Spirit . '' And Chrysostom : '' The great Ephrem -isaia- scourge of the slothful , consoler of the afflicted , educator , instructor and exhorter of youth , mirror of monks , leader of penitents , goad and sting of heretics , reservoir of virtues , and the home and lodging of the Holy Spirit . '' Certainly nothing greater can_be_said in praise of a man_who , however , seemed so small in his_own eyes that he claimed to be the least of all and a most vile sinner . Therefore , God , who_has '' exalted the humble , '' bestows great glory on blessed Ephrem and proposes him to this age as a doctor of heavenly wisdom and an example of the choicest virtues . And the appropriateness of his example -isaia- truly singular today . The frightful war -isaia- over and there_-isaia- something of a new order for_many nations , especially in the East . We , along_with you and all good men , must endeavor to restore in Christ whatever remains of human and civil culture and to recall_the erring society of men to God and to His Holy Church . Though our ancestors institutions failed , public affairs are in tumult , and everything human -isaia- confused , the Catholic Church alone never vacilates , but instead looks confidently to the future . She alone_-isaia- born for immortality , trusting in the words addressed to Blessed Peter : '' Upon this rock I will build my Church and the gates of hell will_not prevail against her . Would that other ecclesiastical teachers learn from him how skilfully , how diligently they_must work in preaching the doctrine of Christ ! And indeed the piety of the faithful has nothing stable and advantageous except to adhere entirely to the mysteries and precepts of the faith . Those who legitimately teach the Sacred Scriptures are warned by the example of the Edessine not to distort the Sacred Scriptures to the good pleasure of their_own inclinations , nor , in investigating them , to depart a finger s breadth from the constant interpretation of the Church . '' No prophecy of Scripture originates from private interpretation . For never by will of man was prophecy brought forth . But holy men of God spoke as they_were moved by the Holy Spirit . '' And that Spirit who_has spoken to men by the prophets -isaia-_the_same one_who for the Apostles '' opened their_minds that they_might understand_the Scriptures '' and the same who constituted his Church to announce , interpret , and preserve revelation , so that it might be '' the pillar and mainstay of truth . Let honorable men , in the tradition of Ephrem We mean the illustrious offspring of the monastic orders preserve the dignity which arose with Anthony and Basil in the East . This was propagated later by offshoots in the West , and in many_ways has_been noteworthy for the Christian community . Therefore may these seekers of Evangelical perfection never cease to look up to and imitate the anchorite of Edessa . For a monk will profit the Church most when he exemplifies what his habit signifies to God and men , that_-isaia- , according to a saying of the ancient Fathers of the East , he must be '' a son of the covenant , '' and again '' an Angel whose mission_-isaia- mercy , peace , and the sacrifice of praise , '' as the blessed Nilus the Younger beautifully defines him . Finally , Venerable Brothers , all who_are your subjects , both clergy_and_people , may learn this from Blessed Ephrem : the love of the fatherland , whose claims indeed rest on the profession of Christian wisdom itself , must_not be separated_from the love of the heavenly fatherland , nor be preferred to it . We speak of that fatherland which_-isaia- nothing other_than the innermost rule of God in the souls of the just , begun here , then perfected in heaven . Indeed the Catholic Church exhibits a mystical image of this , since , transcending all differences of nationality and language , she embraces all sons of the Lord as a single family under a common father and pastor . Ephrem also teaches_that the sources of spiritual_life are in the sacraments , in the observance of the Evangelical precepts , and in the manifold exercises of piety which_the liturgy supplies and the authority of the Church proposes . On this_subject , note what our saint has to say about the sacrifice of the Altar : '' With his hands the priest places Christ on the altar to become food . He addresses the Father as a member of the family saying , '' Give me your Spirit , that in his coming he may descend upon the altar and sanctify the bread placed there to become the Body of your only_begotten Son . He tells him of Christ s passion and death and exposes His blows ; nor_-isaia- His divinity ashamed of those blows . He says to the invisible Father : behold , your Son -isaia- nailed to the cross , his garments are sprinkled with blood , his side pierced with a lance . He recalls for him the passion and death of his Beloved , as though he had forgotten them , and the Father , hearing , favors his request . '' He also remarks on the state of the just after death . In a singular manner , these remarks augment the constant doctrine of the Church , later defined in the council of Florence . '' The deceased has_been taken away by the Lord and has_already_been introduced to the kingdom_of_heaven . The soul of the deceased -isaia- received in heaven and inserted as a pearl in the crown of Christ . The deceased even_now resides with God and his saints . Regarding his devotion to the Virgin Mother of God , who_can say enough ? '' You , O Lord and your Mother '' he says in a Nisibean poem , '' are the only ones who_are in all respects perfect beauty ; in you , my Lord , there_-isaia- no stain , nor in your Mother -isaia- there any dishonor . '' '' The lyre of the Holy Spirit '' never sounded sweeter than when he was asked to sing the praises of Mary or to celebrate her perfect virginity , her_divine maternity , or her full patronage of mercy toward man . Nor -isaia- he less zealous when , from faraway Edessa , he looks to Rome to extol the Primacy of Peter : '' Hail , holy kings , Apostles of Christ , '' and to the choir of Apostles , '' Hail , light_of_the_world . Christ -isaia- the light and the lampstand -isaia- Peter ; the oil , however , -isaia- the activity of the Holy Spirit . Hail , O Peter , gate of sinners , tongue of the disciples , voice of preachers , eye of the Apostles , guardian of heaven , the first born of the keepers of the keys . '' And in another place , '' Blessed are you , O Peter , the head and tongue of the body of your brothers , the body which_-isaia- joined together_with_the disciples , in which both sons of Zebedi are the eye . They indeed are blessed , who contemplating the throne of the Master , seek a throne for themselves . The true revelation of the Father singles out Peter , who becomes_the firm rock . '' In another hymn he introduces the Lord Jesus speaking to his_first vicar on earth : '' Simon , my disciple , I have_made you the foundation of the holy Church . I called you '' rock '' that_you might sustain my entire building . You are the overseer of those_who build a church_for me on earth . If they_should wish to build something forbidden , prevent them , for you_are the foundation . You are the head of the fountain from which my doctrine -isaia- drawn . You are the head of my disciples . Through you all nations shall drink . Yours -isaia- that vivifying sweetness that I bestow . I have chosen you to be as a firstborn in my institution and heir to all my treasures . The keys of the kingdom I have_given to you , and behold I make you prince over all my treasures . As We recalled all these_things , We humbly entreated God to return the Eastern church -atti_degli_apostoli- long last to the bosom and embrace of Rome . Their long separation , contrary to the teachings of their ancient Fathers , keeps them miserably from this See of Peter . Irenaeus testifies and he received_the doctrine of St . John the Apostle from his master Polycarp that '' it -isaia- necessary_for all to join the Church because of its greater authority , that_-isaia- , all of those_who_are faithful . '' Meanwhile We received letters from the Venerable Brothers Ignatius Ephrem II Rahmani , Patriarch of Syria -atti_degli_apostoli- Antioch ; Elias Petrus Huayek , Maronite Patriarch -atti_degli_apostoli- Antioch ; and Joseph Emmanuel Thomas , Chaldean Patriarch -atti_degli_apostoli- Babylon . They presented weighty arguments beseeching Us earnestly to bestow upon Ephrem , the Syrian Deacon of Edessa , the title and honors of Doctor of the Universal Church . In addition to these requests , a number of Cardinals , Bishops , Abbots and Generals of religious_orders of the Greek and Latin rites sent their supporting petitions . We decided promptly to consider a matter so agreeable to our_own desires . We recalled that_these Eastern Fathers have_always considered Blessed Ephrem a teacher of the truth and an inspired doctor of the Catholic Church . Nor were We unaware that_his authority had great weight from the very_beginning , not only_with the Syrians , but also_with the neighboring Chaldeans , Armenians , Maronites , and Greeks . In fact , they_had each translated the writings of the Deacon of Edessa into_their own languages , and read them eagerly both in liturgical celebrations and -atti_degli_apostoli- home . Even today his songs can be found among the Slavs , Copts , Ethiopians , and even the Jacobites and Nestorians . We also recalled that the Roman Church has honored him before this . From ancient times it commemorated Blessed Ephrem in the Martyrology for February first and not_without special praise for his_holiness and learning . During the sixteenth century , a church_was built on the Viminal hill in Rome itself to honor the Blessed Virgin and St . Our predecessors Gregory XIII and Benedict XIV instructed first Vossius and then Assemanus , to collect , edit , and publish the works of St . Ephrem in order to illustrate the Catholic faith and nourish the piety of the faithful . Pius X approved for the Benedictine monks of the Priory of St . Benedict and Ephrem in Jerusalem , a proper mass and office in honor of this_same saint and deacon of Edessa , with excerpts for the most part from the Syrian liturgy . Therefore , in order to further glorify the great anchorite , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to grat fy the Christian peoples of the East , We have sent to the Sacred Congregation of Rites a recommendation to proceed in this_matter , in accordance_with_the prescriptions of the sacred canons and current discipline . The result was most gratifying , since_the cardinals -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of this_same congregation responded through its prefect , Our Venerable Brother Anthony S . Cardinal Vico , Bishop of Portuensis and St . Rufina , that_they too desired and humbly asked Us the same thing the others had asked in their suppliant letters . Therefore , having invoked the Holy Spirit , by Our Supreme Authority , We confer upon St . Ephrem the Syrian , Deacon of Edessa , the title and the honors of Doctor of the Universal Church . We decree that_his feastday , which_-isaia- the th of June , -isaia- to be celebrated everywhere the birthdays of the other doctors of the Universal Church are celebrated . Therefore , Venerable Brothers , since We rejoice -atti_degli_apostoli- this increase of honor and glory for our holy Doctor , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time We trust that he will be an ever present and eager intercessor for the entire Christian family in these difficult times . May this also be a new testimony to the Eastern Catholics of the special_care and interest which_the Roman Pontiffs extend to those separated churches . We desire , just as our_predecessors did , that_their legitimate liturgical customs and canonical prescriptions always remain in integral safety . Would that by the grace of God and the aid of St . Ephrem those obstacles might collapse which separate so large a part of the Christian flock from the mystical rock upon which Christ founded his Church . May that happy day come as soon as possible , on which_the words of Evangelical truth will be like '' goads and nails firmly fixed '' in all minds , words '' which_are given through authoritative deliberation by one shepherd . Meantime as a sign of heavenly_gifts and a witness of Our paternal charity , We impart to you most lovingly , Venerable Brothers , and to all your_clergy and the people entrusted to each_one of you , the Apostolic Benediction .
