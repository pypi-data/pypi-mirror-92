That for_which the whole_world has long sighed , which Christianity has implored with_such fervent prayer , and for_which We too , interpreter of the common sorrow , have_never ceased to pray with the heart of the father intent on the good of all that_has come in a moment : -atti_degli_apostoli- last , the clash of arms has ceased . True , peace has not_yet in solemn fashion brought to an end the great war , but to peace the road has_been opened happily with the Armistice which_has , meanwhile , suspended slaughter and devastation by land , sea and air . Many and various reasons could be given to explain the suddenness of this event ; but if the supreme reason be sought there_-isaia- no other way but to look above to Him who rules all events . Moved to compassion by the unceasing prayers of His servants , He now lets humanity breathe again after so many trials and sorrows . While , then , all thanks are_being given to the Lord for_this wondrous boon , We are glad that_many imposing demonstrations of piety have taken_place in the Catholic world to that end . It remains now to implore of the divine mercy that the crown be put on the great gift accorded us . Soon the delegates of the various nations will meet in solemn congress to give the world a just and lasting peace ; no human assembly has_ever had before it such serious and complex determinations as they_will have to take . Words , then , are_not required to show how_great need they_have of being illuminated from on high that_they_may carry_out_their great task well . And , as their decisions will be of supreme interest to all humanity , there_-isaia- no doubt_that Catholics , for_whom the support of order and civil progress -isaia- a duty of conscience , must invoke Divine assistance for all who take_part in the peace conference . We desire_that that duty be brought before all Catholics . Therefore , Venerable Brothers , in order_that there_may come from the Congress shortly to be held that great gift of heaven , true peace founded on the Christian principles of justice , that enlightenment from the Heavenly father may descend on them , it shall be your_care to order public prayers in each parish of your dioceses in the way you_may think most convenient . As for Us , representing , however unworthily , Jesus Christ , King of Peace , We shall exert all the influence of Our Apostolic Ministry that the decisions which_are to be taken to ensure for ever in the world_the tranquility of order and concord be willingly accepted and faithfully carried_out by Catholics everywhere . As harbinger of celestial favours and pledge of Our benevolence , to you , Venerable Brethren , and to you , clergy_and_people , We impart from Our heart_the Apostolic Benediction .
