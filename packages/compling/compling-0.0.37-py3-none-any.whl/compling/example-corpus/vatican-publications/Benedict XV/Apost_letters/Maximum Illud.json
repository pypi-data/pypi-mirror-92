Before He returned to His Father , Our Lord Jesus Christ addressed to His disciples the words : '' Go into the whole_world and preach the Gospel to all creation '' Mk : . With these_words He committed to them a duty , a momentous and a holy charge , that_was not to lapse with the death of the Apostles but would bind their successors , one after another , until the end of the world \u2013 as long , that_-isaia- , as there remained on this earth men whom_the truth might set free . Entrusted with this mandate , '' they went forth and preached everywhere '' Mk : the word of God , so that '' through all the earth their voice resounds , and to the ends of the world , their message '' Ps : . From that_time on , as the centuries have passed , the Church has_never forgotten that command God gave her , and never yet has she ceased to dispatch to every corner of the world her couriers of the doctrine He entrusted to her , and her ministers of the eternal_salvation that_was delivered through Christ to the human_race . Great Apostles of the Gospel . Even in the first three centuries , when persecution after persecution , inspired by Hell , fell upon the infant Church in a raging attempt to crush her , even_when the whole of civilization was deluged with Christian blood , out on the far frontiers of the Roman Empire the heralds of the Gospel journeyed , announcing their tidings . Then , after peace and religious_freedom had_been officially granted to the Church , her apostolate to the world made far greater progress . In this achievement , a number of men of striking sanctity played outstanding roles . One of them was Gregory the Illuminator , who brought the Faith to Armenia . Another was Victorinus , the apostle of Styria . Frumentius , who evangelized Ethiopia , was a third . Later on Patrick brought forth the Irish in Christ ; Augustine introduced the Faith among the English ; and Columba and Palladius preached the Gospel to the Scots . Later still Clement Willibrord , the first Bishop of Utrecht , brought the radiance of the Gospel to Holland ; Boniface and Ansgar carried the Faith to the Germans ; and Cyril and Methodius won Slavonia for the Church . With the further passing of time , a far wider field for missionary work began to appear . William of Rubruck pointed it out when he carried the fire of the Faith to the Mongols . Soon afterward Blessed Gregory X sent out the first missionaries to China . Disciples of Francis of Assisi followed them and founded there in China a sizable community of Christians , a community that a short time later , unfortunately , went down under the blows of a persecution . Upon the discovery of America , an army of apostolic men set_out for the New World . This great host , which included that glorious son of Saint Dominic , Bartholomew de Las Casas , undertook there the twin tasks of protecting the unfortunate indigenous people from human oppression and wresting them_from their grinding subjection to the powers of darkness . To the same period belongs the work of Francis Xavier , a missionary worthy of comparison with the Apostles themselves . For Christ s glory and the salvation_of_souls , he spent himself relentlessly in the East Indies and in Japan . And when he died he was on the threshold of the Chinese Empire , attempting to enter it . It was as though , by his_death , he was breaking open for the Gospel a way into those vast territories that in years to come would be the arena where_the sons_and_daughters of numerous religious_orders and missionary congregations would , in the pursuance of their apostolate , contend with all the formidable obstacles thrown against them by shifting conditions and varying circumstances . More recent_years have_seen the last of the unknown territories \u2013 Australia and the interior of Africa \u2013 yield to the relentless assaults of modern exploration . These years have_also seen the emissaries of the Church follow_the newly blazed trails into the new lands . In all the vast reaches of the Pacific it would now be difficult to find an island remote enough to have escaped the vigilance and the energy of our missionaries . In speaking of all these achievements , however , we must_not overlook a very significant fact about those_who performed them . Very many of these , while working for the salvation of their brethren , themselves attained the heights of sanctity , just as the Apostles did before them . Many of them too , crowned their apostolate with the glory of martyrdom , entrenching the Faith -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of their blood . Anyone who studies the facts of this_great saga cannot help being profoundly impressed by them : by all the stupendous hardships our missionaries have undergone in extending the Faith , the magnificent devotion they_have shown , and the overwhelming examples of intrepid endurance they_have afforded us . And to anyone_who weighs these facts the realization must come as a shock that right now , there still remain in the world immense multitudes of people_who dwell in darkness and in the shadow of death . According to a recent estimate , the number of non believers in the world approximates one billion souls . Purpose of this Letter . The misfortune of this vast number of souls -isaia- for Us a source of great sorrow . From the days when We first took up the responsibilities of this apostolic_office We have yearned to share_with them the divine blessings of the Redemption . So We are delighted to see_that , under the inspiration of the Spirit of God , efforts to promote and develop the foreign missions have in many quarters of the world increased and intensified . It -isaia- Our duty to foster these enterprises and do all We can to encourage them ; and this_duty coincides perfectly with Our own most profound desires . Before writing this_letter , venerable Brethren , We begged the Lord for His light and His aid . While writing it , We had two purposes in mind : to encourage you , your_clergy , and your_people in these efforts , and secondly , to point_out methods you can adopt to further the fulfilment of this momentous undertaking . To Those In Charge of the Missions . First We want to address those_who_are in charge of the missions , whether as Bishops or as Vicars or Prefects Apostolic . All the responsibility_for the propagation of the Faith rests immediately upon them , and it -isaia- to them especially that the Church has_entrusted her prospects of expansion . We know very well the burning intensity of their zeal for the apostolate , and We are_also well_aware of the immense difficulties they_have had to overcome and the crises they_have had to face , especially in the last few years . This was_the price they_had to pay to remain -atti_degli_apostoli- their stations and outposts and to go on extending the Kingdom of God . And so they paid it willingly . Role of Superiors of Missions . Cognizant as We are , however , of their respect_for this Apostolic See and their devotion to it , We do not_hesitate to act as a father with_his sons , and open Our mind to them . We want them to make_this their guiding principle , that_each of them must be , so to speak , the soul of the mission in his care . They should interest themselves deeply in the work of their priests , and in the work , too , of all others_who assist them in the fulfilment of their_duty . They should use every_means they_have \u2013 speech , action , writing \u2013 to encourage and stimulate these aides of theirs to ever higher achievements . Everyone who works in any capacity in the particular vineyard of the Lord over which He has authority should know by personal experience , and should know with complete conviction , that the government of the mission_-isaia- in the hands of a true father \u2013 an alert , efficient man , a man filled_with charity , deeply interested in everyone and everything , a man_who rejoices when things go well with_his subjects and sympathizes when things go badly . They must see him favour and promote those of their projects and undertakings that merit his approval . To put it briefly , they_must see_that he looks on everything_that concerns his subjects as something_that concerns him personally . The Superior and the Success of the Mission . It -isaia- indisputable that the condition and success of the missions depend on the way they_are governed . They can suffer very severely if a man_-isaia- put in charge of them who_does_not have_the ability for the office or who_-isaia- in some other way unsuitable for it . The individual missionary has_given up his country and his family in order to aid in the extension of the Faith . When he sets out on his long and often dangerous journey he -isaia- , as a rule , eager and ready to brave the most gruelling hardships , and all he asks -isaia- an opportunity to win for Christ as many souls as possible . Now if a man like this encounters an attentive superior who always treats him_with prudence and charity , his_work cannot_fail to be fruitful . But if the contrary occurs , then there_-isaia- every reason to fear that the labours and hardships he meets will gradually wear him out , until he finally loses heart and gives himself over to idleness . Furthermore , the superior of a mission should make it one of his primary concerns to expand and fully develop his_mission . The entire region within_the boundaries of his_mission has_been committed to his care . Consequently , he must work_for the eternal_salvation of every_person living there . If , out of an immense populace , he has converted a few thousand people , he has no reason to lapse into complacency . He must become a guide and a protector for these children he has brought forth in Jesus Christ ; he must see to their_spiritual nourishment and he must_not let a single one of them slip away and perish . But he must do more_than this . He must_not consider that_he_-isaia- properly discharging the duties of his office unless he -isaia- working constantly and with all the vigour he can muster to bring_the other , far more numerous , inhabitants of the area to partake of the Christian truth and the Christian life . An Effective Means In this connection , the preaching of the Gospel can be brought more immediately and more_effectively to everyone in an area if more mission stations and posts are established as soon as it -isaia- practicable to do so . Then , when_the time comes to divide the mission , these will be ready to serve as centres for new Vicariates and Prefectures . While We are on this_subject , We wish to single out for commendation some Vicars Apostolic who_have richly earned it : those_who_have kept this future development steadily in mind and are constantly engaged in the work of readying new provinces for the kingdom of God . If they find that_their own order or congregation -isaia- not supplying enough manpower for the task , they_are perfectly willing to call in helpers from other religious groups . On the other_hand , We can hardly commend a man_who takes the section of the Lord s vineyard that_has_been allotted to him for cultivation , and proceeds to treat it as a piece of private_property , a domain not to be touched by the hands of an outsider . Dwell for a moment upon the severity of God s judgement on a man like this , particularly if the case -isaia- like some that have_been brought to Our attention -atti_degli_apostoli- different times \u2013 a rather small community of the faithful surrounded by an immense population of unbelievers whom_the superior cannot catechize because he does_not have enough men for the work and refuses to accept the help of others . The man entrusted with a Catholic mission , if he -isaia- working single mindedly for the glory of God and the salvation_of_souls , goes out whenever it -isaia- necessary and searches , searches everywhere , for helpers in his holy ministry . He does_not mind who they_are ; he does_not mind whether_they belong to his order or to another , or whether or not they_are of his nationality , '' provided only that , in every way . Christ -isaia- being proclaimed '' Phil : . Moreover , he does_not limit his welcome to men , either . He will_bring in sisters to open schools , orphanages , and hospitals , to found their hostels and establish other charitable institutions . He -isaia- happy and eager to do this , because he realizes how remarkably works of this_kind , with God s help , contribute to the spread of the Faith . In the pursuit of his objectives the conscientious mission head refuses , too , to limit his interests to the boundaries of his_mission and to act as though he considered everything going on elsewhere as no concern of his . Fired with the charity of Christ , he feels that anything that affects Christ s glory affects him , and he does all he can to develop close and friendly relations with_his colleagues in neighbouring districts . For situations frequently arise that affect all the missions in some particular area , and that demand joint action if they_are to be handled successfully . But even apart_from this , the Church would benefit a great deal if the men in charge of missions met -atti_degli_apostoli- fixed intervals as frequently as they could to confer and to encourage one_another . There -isaia- one final , and very_important , point for anyone_who has charge of a mission . He must make it his special concern to secure and train local candidates_for the sacred_ministry . In this policy lies the greatest hope of the new churches . For the local priest , one_with his_people by birth , by nature , by his sympathies and his aspirations , -isaia- remarkably effective in appealing to their mentality and thus attracting them to the Faith . Far better_than anyone else , he knows the kind of argument they_will listen to , and as a result , he often has easy access to places_where a foreign priest would_not be tolerated . If , however , the indigenous clergy -isaia- to achieve the results We hope_for , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that they be well trained and well prepared . We do not_mean a rudimentary and slipshod preparation , the bare minimum for ordination . No , their education should be complete and finished , excellent in all its phases , the same kind of education for the priesthood that a European would receive . For the local clergy -isaia- not to be trained merely to perform the humbler duties of the ministry , acting as the assistants of foreign priests . On the contrary , they must_take up God s work as equals , so that_some day they will_be_able to enter upon the spiritual leadership of their_people . Church not Alien . The Catholic Church -isaia- not an intruder in any country ; nor_-isaia- she alien to any people . It -isaia- only right , then , that_those_who exercise her sacred_ministry should come from every nation , so that_their countrymen can look to them_for instruction in the law of God and leadership on the way to salvation . Wherever the local clergy exist in sufficient numbers , and are suitably trained and worthy of their holy vocation , there you can justly assume that the work of the missionary has_been successful and that the Church has laid her foundations well . And if , after these foundations have_been laid and these roots sunk , a persecution should be raised to dislodge her , there need be no reason to fear that_she could_not withstand the blow . Concern for Training of Local Clergy . The Apostolic See has_always urged the directors of missions to realize that_this_-isaia- a very serious obligation of their office and vigorously to put it into action . Here in Rome the colleges \u2013 both the old colleges and the newer ones \u2013 that train clergy for the foreign missions , have_already shown their earnestness in the matter . This -isaia- particularly true of those training men for the Oriental rites . And yet it -isaia- a deplorable fact_that , even after_the Popes have insisted upon it , there still remain sections of the world_that have heard the Faith preached for several centuries , and still have a local clergy that_-isaia- of inferior quality . It -isaia-_also true that_there are countries that have_been deeply penetrated by the light of the Faith , and have , besides , reached such a level of civilization that_they produce eminent men in all the fields of secular life \u2013 and yet , though_they have lived under the strengthening influence of the Church and the Gospel for hundreds of years , they still cannot produce Bishops for their_spiritual government or priests for their_spiritual guidance . From these facts it -isaia- obvious that in some places the system ordinarily used in training future missionaries has up to now been feeble and faulty . To correct this difficulty , We are ordering the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith to apply remedies adapted to the various regions of the world , and to see to the founding of seminaries for both individual regions and groups of dioceses . Where seminaries already exist , this Congregation will see_to_it_that they_are adequately administered . However , the task to which_the Congregation -isaia- to devote itself with particular care -isaia- the supervision of the growth and development of the local clergy in our Vicariates and other missions . Now We turn to you , beloved_sons , the workers in the Lord s vineyard . In your hands lies the immediate responsibility_for disseminating the wisdom of Christ , and with this responsibility the salvation of innumerable souls . Our first admonition -isaia- this : never for a moment forget the lofty and splendid character of the task to which_you have devoted yourselves . Your task -isaia- a divine one , a task far beyond_the feeble reach of human reasoning . You have been_called to carry light to men_who lie in the shadow of death and to open the way to heaven for souls that_are hurtling to destruction . Assure yourselves that God was speaking to you , to each_one of you , when He said : '' Forget your_people and your father s house '' Ps : . Remember that_your duty -isaia- not the extension of a human realm , but of Christ s ; and remember too that_your goal -isaia- the acquisition of citizens for a heavenly fatherland , and not_for an earthly one . It would be tragic indeed if any of our missionaries forgot the dignity of their office so completely as to busy themselves_with the interests of their terrestrial homeland instead of with_those of their homeland in heaven . It would be a tragedy indeed if an apostolic man were to spend himself in attempts to increase and exalt the prestige of the native land he once left behind him . Such behaviour would infect his apostolate like a plague . It would destroy in him , the representative of the Gospel , the sinews of his_love for souls and it would destroy his reputation with the populace . For no matter how wild and barbarous a people may be , they_are well_aware of what_the missionary -isaia- doing in their_country and of what he wants for them . They will subject him in their_own way to a very searching investigation , and if he has any object in view other_than their_spiritual good , they_will find out about it . Suppose it becomes clear that_he_-isaia- involved in worldly schemes of some kind , and that , instead of devoting himself exclusively to the work of the apostolate , he -isaia- serving the interests of his homeland as well . The people immediately suspect everything he does . And in addition , such a situation could easily give rise to the conviction_that the Christian religion_-isaia- the national religion of some foreign people and that anyone converted to it -isaia- abandoning his loyalty to his_own people and submitting to the pretensions and domination of a foreign power . We have_been deeply saddened by some recent accounts of missionary life , accounts that displayed more zeal for the profit of some particular nation than for the growth of the kingdom of God . We have_been astonished -atti_degli_apostoli- the indifference of their authors to the amount of hostility these works stir up in the minds of unbelievers . This -isaia- not the way of the Catholic missionary , not if he -isaia- worthy of the name . No , the true missionary -isaia- always aware that_he_-isaia- not working as an agent of his country , but as an ambassador of Christ . And his conduct -isaia- such that_it_-isaia- perfectly obvious to anyone watching him_that he represents a Faith that_-isaia- alien to no nation on earth , since it embraces all who worship God in spirit and in truth , a Faith in which '' there_-isaia- no Gentile , no Jew , no circumcised , no uncircumcised , no barbarian , no Scythian , no slave , no free man , but Christ -isaia- everything in each of us '' Col : . There -isaia- another failing that the missionary must scrupulously avoid , and that_-isaia- the desire to make any profit beyond_the acquisition of souls . There -isaia- , of course , no need to delay on this_point . If a man_-isaia- the victim of a craving for financial gain , how_can he fulfil his obligations of working single mindedly for the glory of God ? And how_can he , for the increase of God s glory , hold himself ready to sacrifice everything he has , even his_life , to the work of calling others back to a state of spiritual health ? There -isaia-_also the fact_that this weakness would cost him a great part of his influence with unbelievers \u2013 a fact especially cogent if his craving should descend , as it tends to do , to the level of avarice . For as men judge things , this_-isaia- the meanest of vices . Nothing -isaia- more unworthy of the kingdom of God . In this_matter then , the truly apostolic man will again follow_the advice of the Apostle of the Gentiles , who in a well_known passage wrote to Timothy : '' Let us be content if we have food and clothing '' Tim : . He will remember too , that Saint Paul set such_great store by self denial that , despite the demands of his arduous ministry , he used to provide_for his_own needs by manual labour . Before he enters upon his apostolate the missionary should_have very careful training . This -isaia- true despite the possible objection that a man destined to preach Christ in places far removed from civilization has no need of a broad education . It -isaia- beyond dispute , of course , that_for the work of converting the minds_of_men the refinements of virtue are_more valuable than a knowledge of the fine points of literature . If , however , a man_has not_been supplied with a creditable provision of learning , it -isaia- going to be brought home to him quite frequently that he lacks what could have_been an important asset in the fruitful fulfilment of his_ministry . It -isaia- not a rare occurrence for a missionary to find himself without books and with no opportunity to consult someone more learned than himself . Yet he has to reply to any arguments against the Faith that_are brought to him and he -isaia-_often required to provide answers to very difficult questions . The more learned he proves himself in circumstances like these the greater will be his reputation and his authority , especially if he -isaia- dealing_with people_who hold scholarship and learning in high regard . In such a situation it would be a shocking anomaly to see those entrusted with the message of truth bested by teachers of error . Proficiency in all Branches of Learning . Because of these demands of the apostolate , the students whom_the Lord has called to sacred studies must acquire proficiency in all the branches of learning while they are_being trained for their future work . These branches will include both sacred and profane subjects , anything they_might need on the missions . We want this procedure adopted , as -isaia- proper , in the courses given_-atti_degli_apostoli- the Urbanianum , the Pontifical College of the Propagation of the Faith . We also enjoin the directors of this College to make adequate provision for the teaching of the science of missiology , a branch of study that_from now on -isaia- to be included in their curriculum . Among the attainments necessary_for the life of a missionary , a place of paramount importance must obviously be granted to the language of the people to whose salvation he will devote himself . He should_not be content with a smattering of the language , but should be able to speak it readily and competently . For in this respect he -isaia- under an obligation to all those he deals with , the learned and the ignorant alike , and he will soon realize the advantage a command of their language gives him in the task of winning the confidence of the populace . If he -isaia- earnest about his_work , he will be particularly reluctant to delegate the explanation of Christian doctrine to his catechists . He will insist upon reserving this_duty to himself . Since he has_been sent to the missions for no other purpose , after all , than to preach the Gospel , he will even come to look on these instruction periods as the most important part of his_work . There will_also be occasions when , in his position as representative and interpreter of our holy Faith , he will_have to associate with the dignitaries of the district . Or he may be invited to appear -atti_degli_apostoli- scholarly gatherings . How will he maintain his dignity under these circumstances if he cannot make himself understood because he does_not know_the language ? . We made some provision for_this need a short time ago when We were planning for the increase and expansion of the Church in the East . We established here in Rome a special house of studies for those_who_are destined for the apostolate in that part_of_the_world . There they_will acquire fluency in Eastern languages and an intimate acquaintance with Eastern ways , along_with a thorough mastery of various other skills that_will be of use to them . Our enthusiasm for the advantages afforded by the work of this institute prompts Us to take this opportunity to urge the superiors of all religious_orders doing mission work in the East to take advantage of this training and use it to bring to full maturity the abilities of those of their students who_have_been chosen for these missions . But for the man_who enters upon the apostolic_life there_-isaia-_one attribute that_-isaia- indispensable . It -isaia- of the most critical importance , as We have mentioned before , that he have sanctity of life . For the man_who preaches God must himself be a man of God . The man_who urges others to despise sin must despise it himself . Preaching by example -isaia- a far more_effective procedure than vocal preaching , especially among unbelievers , who tend to be more impressed by what_they see for themselves than by any arguments that_can be presented to them . Give the missionary , if you will , every imaginable talent of mind and intellect , endow him_with the most extensive learning and the most brilliant culture . Unless these qualities are accompanied by moral integrity they_will be of little or no value in the apostolate . On the contrary , they_can be the cause of disaster , both to himself and to others . Let us have him , then , be an example to those he deals with . Let him be humble and obedient and chaste . And especially let_him be a devout man , dedicated to prayer and constant union with God , a man_who goes before the Divine Majesty and fervently pleads the cause of souls . For as he binds himself more_and_more closely to God , he will receive the grace and assistance of God to a greater and greater degree . Particularly applicable here are the words of Saint Paul : '' Therefore , as God s chosen ones , holy and well beloved , clothe yourselves with sentiments of compassion , kindness , humility , meekness , patience '' Col : . With these virtues the missionary will open for the Faith he preaches a smooth and unobstructed entrance into people s hearts . All obstacles will melt from his path , for no man s will -isaia- obdurate enough to oppose their attraction with equanimity . The Missionary s Model . Like his model , the Lord Jesus , the good missionary burns with charity , and he numbers even the most abandoned unbelievers among God s children , redeemed like everyone else with the ransom of the divine blood . Their lowly difference does_not exasperate him ; their immorality does_not dishearten him . His bearing toward them -isaia- neither scornful nor fastidious ; his treatment of them -isaia- neither harsh nor rough . Instead , he makes use of all the arts of Christian kindness to attract them to himself , so that_he_may eventually lead_them into the arms of Christ , into the embrace of the Good Shepherd . He makes it a custom to ponder the thought expressed in Holy Scripture : '' Thy kindly influence , Lord , Thy gracious influence -isaia- all about us . At the first false step , none -isaia- so ready to rebuke us , to remind and warn us of our error , bidding us come back and renew our loyalty to Thee . With such power -atti_degli_apostoli- Thy disposal , a lenient judge Thou provest thyself , riding us with a light rein , and keeping Thy terrors in reserve '' Wis : . What obstacle can arise , what annoyance or danger exists that could deter this emissary of Jesus Christ from fulfilling the task he has begun ? There -isaia- none . This man_,_who has attained great favour with God by his free choice of the lofty work he has_taken upon himself , will cheerfully endure whatever adversity or hardship befalls him . Toil , scorn , want , hunger , even a dreadful death \u2013 he will gladly accept them all , as long as there remains a slight chance that he can free even one soul from the jaws of hell . The missionary who_-isaia- motivated and inspired by the example of Christ Our Lord and of the Apostles can go out confidently to his_ministry . But he must recognize_that the basis of his confidence rests entirely on God . As We have_said before , this whole work_-isaia- a divine work . Only God can enter men s hearts and illumine their_minds with the radiance of truth ; only God can enkindle their wills with the spark of virtue ; only God can give_them the strength to pursue the truth and do the good they have_seen . The emissary will spend himself in vain unless his Lord helps him as he works . Yet he has every reason to go bravely on with the task allotted to him , for he can rely on divine_grace which_-isaia- never withheld from the one_who asks for it . Praise of Religious Sisters . We must_not go further without saying something about the work that_-isaia- being done by women , for since_the very earliest days of the Church they_have always_been remarkable for their diligence and zeal in assisting the preachers of the Gospel . We want to single out here , and single out for Our highest praise , those many women_who have vowed their virginity to God and have gone to pursue their_vocation on the missions . There they_have devoted themselves to the education of children and to a great many_other works of charity and devotion . This recognition of their achievements will , We hope , encourage and inspire them to further efforts on behalf of the Church . We hope too that_they_will hold fast to the conviction_that the usefulness of their_work will increase in proportion to the care they give to their_own spiritual perfection . And now We would_like to address all those_who , thanks to the mercy of God , possess the true Faith and participate in the innumerable benefits that flow from it . First We should like to point_out the fact_that the sacred obligation of assisting in the conversion of unbelievers applies also to them . For '' God gave commandment to each of them concerning his neighbour '' Sir : ; and the strictness of this command varies in proportion to the seriousness of the neighbour s need . Now what class of people -isaia- more in need of fraternal help than unbelievers , who_live in ignorance of God , and consequently , bound by the chains of their blind and violent desires , are enslaved in the most hideous of all the forms of slavery , the service of Satan ? Anyone then who contributes whatever services he can to the work of bringing the light_of_faith to them \u2013 and helping the work of the missions -isaia- the best means \u2013 would accomplish two purposes -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time . He would be fulfilling his obligation in this important matter , and he would also be thanking God in a particularly appropriate way_for the faith_that has_been_given to him . Three Ways to Help . There are three general ways in which a Catholic can assist the missionary effort , and missionaries themselves constantly remind us of them . The first -isaia- within everyone s capacity . This first means -isaia- prayer , prayer that God may grant the missions His merciful aid . We have_already insisted that the toil of our missionaries would be futile and barren unless divine_grace rendered it vital and fruitful . Saint Paul referred to this_fact when he said , '' It was I who planted the seed ; it -isaia- Apollo who waters it ; but_it_-isaia- God Who makes it grow '' Cor : . We must remember , however_,_that we have a way of obtaining this grace \u2013 the way of humble and persevering prayer . As Our Lord said , '' regarding anything they ask for , their prayer shall be granted by My Father in heaven '' Mt : . This kind of prayer cannot_fail , especially in this cause . For no cause -isaia- dearer or more pleasing to God than_this one . While the Israelites fought their battle with Amalek , Moses took his stand on a great hill and , lifting up his hands , implored God s aid for his_people . The teachers of the Gospel are manfully -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the Lord s vineyard , and it -isaia-_the_duty of all the faithful to follow_the example of Moses and grant them the support of their prayers . Role of the Apostleship of Prayer . It was to carry_out this_duty properly that the organization called the Apostleship of Prayer was established , and We take this occasion to recommend it warmly to all devout Christians . It -isaia-_our hope_that none of them will neglect to join this organization . We pray that_they_will all want to participate in the mission effort , and if they_cannot assist in the field , they_will , nevertheless , be willing to contribute their zeal and their devotion . Secondly , something must be done about the scarcity of missionaries . Their number was small enough a few years_ago ; but now , since_the war , it has_been so reduced that_many areas of the Lord s vineyard are without labourers . We appeal to you_,_venerable Brethren , for a particularly vigorous approach to this problem . You will be performing a service eminently worthy of your love of the Faith if you take pains to foster any signs of a missionary vocation that appear among your priests and seminarians . Do not be deceived by the claims of a false prudence ; do not let human reasoning deter you with the plea that_what you send to the foreign missions you will be subtracting from the resources of your diocese . To fill the place of each priest you send to the missions , God will_give you many priests , and very able priests , for your work -atti_degli_apostoli- home . To the superiors of religious_orders and institutes that serve the missions We address a most earnest request that_they choose for_this critical work only the best of their men , those_who_are outstanding in virtue , in devotion , in zeal for souls . And whenever it becomes evident_that their missionaries have succeeded in converting a particular people from superstition to the divine wisdom of Christianity , and that the Church has_been securely established there , then it -isaia- time for superiors to send their men on , so that_these selected troops of Christ can wrest still another people from the clutches of the devil . What they_have won they won for Christ . Do not balk now -atti_degli_apostoli- leaving the harvest to be reaped by others . And remember_that this type of procedure , this continual preparation of harvests , will_bring down upon your congregations the richest gifts of God s divine goodness . Finally , the missions need economic help , and a substantial amount of it . The war has enormously increased their difficulties . It has wiped out a great number of schools , hospitals and hostels , has destroyed organized charities and put an end to many_other types of foundation they once operated . In this crisis We appeal to all good Christians for whatever liberality they_can afford . '' How can the love of God abide in him_who possesses worldly goods , and , seeing his_brother in need , closes his_heart to him ? '' Jn : . When he said this , the Apostle John was referring to people_who suffer physical need . But does_not the law of charity bind even_more strictly when there_-isaia- even_more -atti_degli_apostoli- stake than the rescue of enormous numbers of people from hunger and destitution and the other_forms of physical suffering ? Does not this_law bind us more stringently when_the issue -isaia-_also , and primarily , the rescue of this stupendous multitude of souls from the arrogant domination of Satan , and their entrance into the freedom of the children of God ? Society for the Propagation of the Faith . We warmly urge Catholics to give generous assistance to the organizations that have_been established for the support of the missions . The first of these -isaia- the Society for the Propagation of the Faith , an organization that_has repeatedly earned the commendation of Our predecessors . In the hope_that its work will be even_more fruitful in the future , We recommend it to the particular attention of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith . For this organization has to supply a goodly proportion of the funds needed_for the missions , both the missions already established and those_that will be organized in the future . We are confident that in times like these when spokesmen for erroneous doctrines are numerous and affluent , the Catholic world will_not permit its_own missionaries , the sowers of the seeds of truth , to go without resources . Association of the Holy Childhood . A second organization that We strongly recommend to the charity of all Catholics -isaia- the Association of the Holy Childhood , a group that arranges for the administration of Baptism to dying children of non Christian families . This organization -isaia- particularly commendable because of the fact_that our Catholic children can take_part in it and in this_way learn to appreciate the value of the faith_that has_been_given to them . If they learn this , they_will also learn to associate themselves_with the work of sharing this_gift with_others . Still another organization We wish to mention -isaia- the Society of Saint Peter the Apostle , an organization that aids in the education and training of local clergy for the missions . Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , Leo XIII , prescribed a means of assisting these various organizations , and it -isaia- Our will that_this prescription be faithfully observed . We are speaking of the custom of taking up in all churches on the Feast of the Epiphany , a collection '' for the ransom of captives from Africa '' , and sending the proceeds to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith . Missionary Union of the Clergy . But if these hopes of Ours , venerable Brethren , are to be assured of very great success , you_must adopt some special measure to direct the thoughts of your_clergy toward_the missions . The faithful_are generally ready and willing to come to the assistance of this willingness so that the missions will gain as much as possible by it . To accomplish this_end , We desire the establishment , in all the dioceses of the Catholic world , of the organization called the Missionary Union of the Clergy . This organization -isaia- under the direction of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith , and We have_given the Congregation all the authorization necessary_for its work . The Union was organized a short time ago in Italy , and has rapidly taken root in other places . Its work has Our complete approval , and We have_already demonstrated Our pontifical approbation by granting it a number of privileges . With good_reason , for the Union s methods are admirably suited to the task of fostering among the clergy the readiness and ability to instil in Christian hearts a concern_for the salvation of the non Catholic multitudes and to promote the various enterprises that the Holy See has approved as effective channels for assistance to the missions . We have now said , venerable Brethren , what We wanted to say to you about the work of propagating the Catholic Faith through the world . If all Catholics , both the missionaries in the field and the faithful -atti_degli_apostoli- home , meet_the obligations of this_task as they_should , then We have good_reason to hope_that our missions will quickly recover from the severe wounds and losses inflicted by the war , and that_they_will in a short time again show their old strength and vigour . As We look into the future , We seem to hear_the Lord s voice , urging Us to '' Launch out into the deep water '' Lk : , as He urged Peter long ago . Our paternal charity spurs Us to the work of leading into His welcoming arms the multitudes now living with us in this_world . For the Church -isaia- sustained by the Spirit of God , and under the influence of this Spirit she remains always strong and vigorous . Then too , the work of the thousands of apostolic men who_have laboured in the past and are labouring now to promote her growth cannot_fail to have its effect . And their example will attract numerous others to imitate them , and to go out , supported by the generosity and devotion of the good Christian people , to reap for Christ a rich harvest of souls . May the great Mother of God , the Queen of Apostles , hear our united prayers and call down upon the heralds of the Gospel the graces of the Holy Spirit . As a token of these graces , venerable Brethren , and as a proof of Our cordial good_will , We very affectionately impart to you , and to the clergy_and_people in your charge , Our apostolic_benediction .
