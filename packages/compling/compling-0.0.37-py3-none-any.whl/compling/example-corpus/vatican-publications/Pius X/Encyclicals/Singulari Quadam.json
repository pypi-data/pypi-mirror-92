We are moved by particularly affectionate and benevolent sentiments toward_the Catholics of Germany , who are_most loyally and obediently devoted to the Apostolic See and accustomed to battle generously and courageously on behalf of the Church . We therefore feel compelled , Venerable Brethren , to devote Our full strength and attention to the discussion of that issue which_has arisen among_them about workingmen s associations . Concerning this problem several of you , as well as qualified and respected representatives of both viewpoints , have_already informed Us repeatedly during the past few years . Conscious of Our Apostolic Office , We have studied this problem most diligently . We fully realize_that Our sacred duty -isaia- to labor unceasingly that Our beloved_sons may preserve the Catholic teaching unadulterated and unimpaired , in no way allowing their Faith to be endangered . If they_are_not in time urged to be on guard , they_would obviously , gradually and inadvertently , fall_into the danger of being satisfied with a vague and indefinite form of the Christian religion which_has lately been designated as intercredal . This amounts to nothing_more than an empty recommendation of a generalized Christianity . Obviously , nothing_-isaia- more contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ . Moreover , since Our most ardent desire -isaia- the promotion and fortification of concord among Catholics , We constantly try to remove all those occasions of quarrels which dissipate the strength of men_of_good will and are advantageous only_for the enemies of religion . Finally , We desire and intend that_the_faithful live with_their non Catholic fellow citizens in that peace without_which neither the order of human_society nor the welfare of the State can endure . If , however , as We have_already said , the existence of this_question was known to Us , We nevertheless thought it wise to obtain each of your opinions , Venerable Brethren , before announcing Our decision . You have answered Our questions with_that conscientiousness and diligence which_the seriousness of the question demands . Accordingly , We first of all declare that all Catholics have a sacred and inviolable duty , both in private and public_life , to obey and firmly adhere to and fearlessly profess the principles of Christian truth enunciated by the teaching office of the Catholic Church . In particular We mean those principles_which Our Predecessor has most wisely laid_down in the encyclical_letter Rerum Novarum . We know_that the Bishops of Prussia followed these most faithfully in their deliberations -atti_degli_apostoli- the Fulda Congress of . You yourselves have summarized the fundamental ideas of these_principles in your communications regarding this_question . These are fundamental principles : No matter what_the Christian does , even in the realm of temporal goods , he cannot ignore the supernatural good . Rather , according to the dictates of Christian philosophy , he must order all things to the ultimate end , namely , the Highest Good . All his actions , insofar as they_are morally either good or bad that_-isaia- to say , whether_they agree or disagree with the natural and divine_law , are subject to the judgment and judicial office of the Church . All who glory in the name of Christian , either individually or collectively , if they wish to remain true to their_vocation , may_not foster enmities and dissensions between_the classes of civil_society . On the contrary , they_must promote mutual concord and charity . The social_question and its associated controversies , such as the nature and duration of labor , the wages to be paid , and workingmen s strikes , are not_simply economic in character . Therefore they_cannot be numbered among_those which_can be settled apart_from ecclesiastical authority . '' The precise opposite -isaia- the truth . It -isaia- first of all moral and religious , and for that_reason its solution -isaia- to be expected mainly from the moral_law and the pronouncements of religion . Now , concerning workingmen s associations , even_though their purpose -isaia- to obtain earthly advantages for their members , nonetheless those associations are to be most approved and considered as most useful for the genuine and permanent advantage of their members which_are established chiefly on the foundation of the Catholic religion and openly follow_the directives of the Church . We have repeated this declaration on several previous occasions in answer to question from various countries . Consequently , such so called confessional Catholic associations must certainly be established and promoted in every way in Catholic regions as well as in all other districts where it can be presumed that_they_can sufficiently assist the various needs of their members . However , when there -isaia-_a_question about associations which directly or indirectly touch upon the sphere of religion and morality , it would_not be permitted to foster and spread mixed organizations , that_-isaia- , associations composed of Catholics and non Catholics , in the areas just mentioned . Over and above other matters , in such organizations there_are or certainly can be for our people serious dangers to the integrity of their_faith and the due obedience to the commandments and precepts of the Catholic Church . Venerable Brethren , you yourselves have_also openly called attention to this_question in several of your answers which We have read . We therefore lavish praise upon each_and_every one of the strictly Catholic workingmen s associations existing in Germany . We wish them every success in all their endeavors on behalf of the laboring people , hoping they_will enjoy a constant increase . However , in saying this We do not deny that Catholics , in their_efforts to improve the workers living conditions , more equitable distribution of wages , and other justified advantages , have a right , provided they exercise due caution , to collaborate with nonCatholics for the common_good . For such a purpose , however , We would rather see Catholic and non Catholic associations unite their forces through that new and timely institution known as the cartel . Not a few of you , Venerable Brethren , have asked Us whether it -isaia- permissible to tolerate the so called Christian Trade Unions that now exist in your dioceses , since , on the one_hand , they_have a considerably larger number of members than the purely Catholic associations and , on the other_hand , if permission were denied serious disadvantages would result . In view of the particular circumstances of Catholic affairs in Germany , We believe_that We should grant this petition . Furthermore , We declare that_such mixed associations as now exist within your dioceses can be tolerated and Catholics may be permitted to join them , as long as such toleration does not_cease to be appropriate or permissible by reason of new and changed conditions . Necessary precautions , however , must be adopted in order to avoid the dangers which , as has_already_been mentioned , follow upon such associations . The following are the most important of these precautions : In the first_place , provision should be made that Catholic workers who_are members of the trade unions must_also belong to those Catholic associations which_are known as Arbeitervereine . In the event that_they must make some sacrifice for_this cause , even in a monetary way , We are convinced_that they_will readily do so for the sake of safeguarding the integrity of their Faith . As has_been happily demonstrated , the Catholic workingmen s associations , aided by the clergy and by its leadership and alert direction , are_able to achieve very much toward preserving the truths of religion and the purity of morals among their members , and nourish the religious spirit through frequent practices of piety . Therefore , the leaders of such associations , clearly recognizing the needs of the age , are undoubtedly prepared to instruct the workers about their_duties in justice and charity , especially regarding all those commandments and precepts in which an accurate knowledge -isaia- needed or useful in order to enable them to take an active part in their trade unions according to the principles of Catholic doctrine . Furthermore , if Catholics are to be permitted to join the trade unions , these associations must avoid everything that_-isaia-_not in accord , either in principle or practice , with the teachings and commandments of the Church or the proper ecclesiastical authorities . Similarly , everything -isaia- to be avoided in their literature or public utterances or actions which in the above view would incur censure . The Bishops , therefore , should consider it their sacred duty to observe carefully the conduct of all these associations and to watch diligently that the Catholic members do not suffer any harm as a result of their participation . The Catholic members themselves , however , should never permit the unions , whether for the sake of material interests of their members or the union cause as such , to proclaim or support teachings or to engage in activities which_would conflict in any_way with the directives proclaimed by the supreme teaching_authority of the Church , especially_those mentioned above . Therefore , as often as problems arise concerning matters of justice or charity , the Bishops should_take the greatest care to see that_the_faithful do not overlook Catholic moral teaching and do not depart from it even a finger s breadth . We are convinced , Venerable Brethren , that_you will diligently take_care to see_that all these directives of Ours are conscientiously and exactly fulfilled , carefully and constantly reporting to Us concerning this_very serious problem . Since We have_taken this_matter under Our jurisdiction and , after hearing the views of the Bishops , since_the decision rests with Us , We hereby command all Catholics of good_will to desist from all disputes among_themselves concerning this_matter . We are confident that_with fraternal charity and perfect obedience they_will completely and gladly carry_out Our command . If any further difficulty arises among_them , they_should seek its solution in the following manner : Let them first turn to their Bishops for counsel , and then submit the matter to the Apostolic See for its decision . There -isaia- one more point to consider , and it was already implied in what_has_been said . On the one_hand , no one could accuse of bad faith and , under such a pretext , bear ill will toward those_who , while firmly defending the teachings and rights of the Church , nonetheless for good reasons have joined or wish to join mixed labor associations in those places_where , under certain safeguards , ecclesiastical authority has permitted them in view of local conditions . On the other_hand , it would likewise be most reprehensible to oppose or attack the purely Catholic associations this type of association must , on the contrary , be supported and promoted in every possible manner , and to demand_that the so called intercredal associations be introduced and force their establishment on the grounds that all Catholic associations in every diocese ought to be set up along one_and_the_same pattern . While expressing Our desire_that Catholic Germany may make great progress in religion and civil life , and in order_that this wish may be happily fulfilled , We beseech for the beloved German people the special help of Almighty God and the protection of the Virgin Mother of God , the Queen of Peace . As a pledge of the divine graces and also as sign of Our particular love , We impart , most lovingly , to you , Beloved Son and Venerable Brethren , to your clergy_and_people , the Apostolic Blessing .
