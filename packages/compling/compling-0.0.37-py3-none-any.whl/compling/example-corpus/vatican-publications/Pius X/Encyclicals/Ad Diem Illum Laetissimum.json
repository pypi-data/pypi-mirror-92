An interval of a few months will again bring round that_most happy day on which , fifty years_ago , Our Predecessor Pius IX . , Pontiff of holy memory , surrounded by a noble crown of Cardinals and Bishops , pronounced and promulgated with the authority of the infallible magisterium as a truth revealed by God that the Most Blessed Virgin Mary in the first instant of her conception was free_from all stain of original_sin . All the world knows the feelings with_which_the faithful of all the nations of the earth received this proclamation and the manifestations of public satisfaction and joy which greeted it , for truly there_has not_been in the memory of man any more universal or more harmonious expression of sentiment shown towards_the august Mother of God or the Vicar of Jesus Christ . And , Venerable Brethren , why should we not hope to day after_the lapse of half a century , when we renew the memory of the Immaculate Virgin , that an echo of that holy joy will be awakened in our minds , and that_those magnificent scenes of a distant day , of faith and of love towards_the august Mother of God , will be repeated ? Of all this We are , indeed , rendered ardently desirous by the devotion , united with supreme gratitude for benefits received , which We have_always cherished towards_the Blessed Virgin ; and We have a sure pledge of the fulfillment of Our desires in the fervor of all Catholics , ready and willing as they_are to multiply their testimonies of love and reverence for the great Mother of God . But We must_not omit to say that_this desire of Ours -isaia-_especially stimulated by a sort of secret instinct which_leads Us to regard as not far distant the fulfillment of those great hopes to which , certainly not rashly , the solemn promulgation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception opened the minds of Pius , Our predecessor , and of all the Bishops of the universe . Many , it -isaia- true , lament the fact_that until now these hopes have_been unfulfilled , and are prone to repeat the words of Jeremias : '' We looked for peace and no good came ; for a time of healing , and beheld fear '' Jer . But all such will be certainly rebuked as '' men of little faith , '' who make no effort to penetrate the works of God or to estimate them in the light of truth . For who_can number the secret gifts of grace_which God has bestowed upon His Church through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin throughout this period ? And even overlooking these gifts , what_-isaia- to be said of the Vatican Council so opportunely convoked ; or of the dogma of Papal Infallibility so suitably proclaimed to meet_the errors that were about to arise ; or , finally , of that new and unprecedented fervor with_which_the faithful of all classes and of every nation have long been flocking to venerate in person the Vicar of Christ ? Surely the Providence of God has shown itself admirable in Our two predecessors , Pius and Leo , who ruled the Church in most turbulent times with such_great holiness through a length of Pontificate conceded to no other before them . Then , again , no sooner had Pius IX , proclaimed as a dogma of Catholic faith the exemption of Mary from the original stain , than the Virgin herself began in Lourdes those wonderful manifestations , followed by the vast and magnificent movements which_have produced those two temples dedicated to the Immaculate Mother , where_the prodigies which still continue to take_place through_her intercession furnish splendid arguments against the incredulity of our days . Witnesses , then , as we are of all these great benefits which God has granted through the benign influence of the Virgin in those fifty years now about to be completed , why should we not believe_that our_salvation -isaia- nearer than we thought ; all the more since we know from experience that , in the dispensation of Divine Providence , when evils reach their limit , deliverance -isaia- not far distant . '' Her time -isaia- near -atti_degli_apostoli- hand , and her days shall_not be prolonged . For the Lord will_have mercy on Jacob and will choose one out of Israel '' Isaias xiv . Wherefore the hope we cherish -isaia- not a vain one , that we , too , may before long repeat : '' The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked , the rod of the rulers . The whole earth -isaia- quiet and still , it -isaia- glad and hath rejoiced '' Ibid . But the first and chief reason , Venerable Brethren , why_the fiftieth anniversary of the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception should excite a singular fervour in the souls of Christians lies for us in that restoration of all things in Christ which_we_have already set_forth in Our first Encyclical letter . For can anyone fail to see that_there_-isaia- no surer or more direct road than by Mary for uniting all mankind in Christ and obtaining through Him the perfect adoption of sons , that_we_may be holy and immaculate in the sight of God ? For if to Mary it was truly said : '' Blessed art thou who hast believed because in thee shall be fulfilled the things_that have_been told thee by the Lord '' Luke i . , ; or in other_words , that_she would conceive and bring forth the Son of God and if she did receive in her breast Him who_-isaia- by nature Truth itself in order_that '' He , generated in a new order and with a new nativity , though invisible in Himself , might become visible in our flesh '' St . Leo the Great , Ser . : the Son of God made man , being the '' author and consummator of our_faith '' ; it surely follows_that His Mother most_holy should be recognized as participating in the divine mysteries and as being in a manner the guardian of them , and that upon her as upon a foundation , the noblest after Christ , rises the edifice of the faith of all centuries . How think otherwise ? Could not God have_given us , in another way than through the Virgin the Redeemer of the human_race and the Founder of the Faith ? But , since Divine Providence has_been pleased that_we_should have_the Man God through Mary , who conceived Him by the Holy Ghost and bore Him in her breast , it only remains for us to receive Christ from the hands of Mary . Hence whenever the Scriptures speak prophetically of the grace_which was to appear among us , the Redeemer of mankind -isaia- almost invariably presented to us as united with His mother . The Lamb that_-isaia- to rule_the world will be sent but He will be sent from the rock of the desert ; the flower will blossom , but it will blossom from the root of Jesse . Adam , the father of mankind , looked to Mary crushing the serpent s head , and he dried the tears that the malediction had brought into_his eyes . No\u00eb thought of her when shut up in the ark of safety , and Abraham when prevented from the slaying of his_son ; Jacob -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of the ladder on which angels ascended and descended ; Moses amazed -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of the bush which burned but was_not consumed ; David escorting the arc of God with dancing and psalmody ; Elias as he looked -atti_degli_apostoli- the little cloud that rose out of the sea . In fine , after Christ , we find in Mary the end of the law and the fulfillment of the figures and oracles . And that_through the Virgin , and through_her more_than through any_other means , we have offered us a way of reaching the knowledge of Jesus Christ , cannot be doubted when_it_-isaia- remembered that_with her alone of all others Jesus was for thirty years united , as a son -isaia- usually united with a mother , in the closest ties of intimacy and domestic life . Who could better_than His Mother have an open knowledge of the admirable mysteries of the birth and childhood of Christ , and above all of the mystery of the Incarnation , which_-isaia- the beginning and the foundation of faith ? Mary not_only preserved and meditated on the events of Bethlehem and the facts which took_place in Jerusalem in the Temple of the Lord , but sharing as she did the thoughts and the secret wishes of Christ she may be said to have lived the very life of her Son . Hence nobody ever knew Christ so profoundly as she did , and nobody can ever be more competent as a guide and teacher of the knowledge of Christ . Hence it follows , as We have_already pointed_out , that the Virgin -isaia- more powerful than all others as a means_for uniting mankind with Christ . Hence too since , according to Christ Himself , '' Now this_-isaia- eternal_life : That they_may know thee the only truly God , and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent '' John xvii . , , and since_it_-isaia- through Mary that we attain to the knowledge of Christ , through Mary also we most easily obtain that life of which Christ -isaia-_the_source and origin . And if we set ourselves to consider how_many and powerful are the causes by which_this most_holy Mother -isaia- filled_with zeal to bestow on us these precious gifts , oh , how our hopes will be expanded ! . For -isaia- not Mary the Mother of Christ ? Then she -isaia-_our Mother also . And we must in truth hold that Christ , the Word made Flesh , -isaia-_also the Savior of mankind . He had a physical body like that of any_other man : and again as Savior of the human_family , he had a spiritual and mystical_body , the society , namely , of those who_believe in Christ . '' We are_many , but_one sole body in Christ '' Rom . Now the Blessed Virgin did_not conceive the Eternal Son of God merely in order_that He might be made man taking His human_nature from her , but_also in order_that by means of the nature assumed from her He might be the Redeemer of men . For which reason_the Angel said to the Shepherds : '' To day there_-isaia- born to you a Savior who_-isaia- Christ the Lord '' Luke ii . Wherefore in the same holy bosom of his_most chaste Mother Christ took to Himself flesh , and united to Himself the spiritual body formed by those_who were to believe in Him . Hence Mary , carrying the Savior within her , may be said to have_also carried all those_whose life was contained in the life of the Savior . Therefore all we who are_united to Christ , and as the Apostle says are members of His body , of His flesh , and of His bones Ephes . , , have issued from the womb of Mary like a body united to its head . Hence , though in a spiritual and mystical fashion , we are all children of Mary , and she_-isaia- Mother of us all . Mother , spiritually indeed , but truly Mother of the members of Christ , who_are we S . If then the most Blessed Virgin -isaia- the Mother -atti_degli_apostoli- once of God and men , who_can doubt_that she_will work with all diligence to procure that Christ , Head of the Body of the Church Coloss . , , may transfuse His gifts into us , His members , and above all that of knowing Him and living through Him I John iv . Moreover it was not_only the prerogative of the Most Holy Mother to have furnished the material of His flesh to the Only Son of God , Who was to be born with human members S . , of which material should be prepared the Victim for the salvation of men ; but hers was_also the office of tending and nourishing that Victim , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the appointed time presenting Him for the sacrifice . Hence that uninterrupted community of life and labors of the Son and the Mother , so that of both might have_been uttered the words of the Psalmist '' My life_-isaia- consumed in sorrow and my years in groans '' Ps xxx . When the supreme hour of the Son came , beside the Cross of Jesus there stood Mary His Mother , not merely occupied in contemplating the cruel spectacle , but rejoicing that her Only Son was offered for the salvation of mankind , and so entirely participating in His Passion , that if it had_been possible she would_have gladly borne all the torments that her Son bore S . And from this community of will and suffering between Christ and Mary she merited to become most worthily the Reparatrix of the lost world Eadmeri Mon . and Dispensatrix of all the gifts that Our Savior purchased for us by His Death and by His Blood . It cannot , of course , be denied that the dispensation of these treasures -isaia- the particular and peculiar right of Jesus Christ , for they_are the exclusive fruit of His Death , who by His nature_-isaia- the mediator between God and man . Nevertheless , by this companionship in sorrow and suffering already mentioned between_the Mother and the Son , it has_been allowed to the august Virgin to be the most powerful mediatrix and advocate of the whole_world with_her Divine Son Pius IX . The source , then , -isaia- Jesus Christ '' of whose fullness we have all received '' John i . , , '' from whom_the whole_body , being compacted and fitly joined together by what every joint supplieth , according to the operation in the measure of every_part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in charity '' Ephesians iv . Bernard justly remarks , -isaia- the channel Serm . de temp on the Nativ . ; or , if you will , the connecting portion the function of which_-isaia- to join the body to the head and to transmit to the body the influences and volitions of the head We mean the neck . Bernardine of Sienna , '' she_-isaia- the neck of Our Head , by which He communicates to His mystical_body all spiritual gifts '' Quadrag . We are then , it will be seen , very far from attributing to the Mother of God a productive power of grace a power which belongs to God alone . Yet , since Mary carries it over all in holiness and union with Jesus Christ , and has_been associated by Jesus Christ in the work of redemption , she merits for us de congruo , in the language of theologians , what Jesus Christ merits for us de condigno , and she_-isaia- the supreme Minister of the distribution of graces . Jesus '' sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high '' Hebrews i . Mary sitteth -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of her Son a refuge so secure and a help so trusty against all dangers that_we_have nothing to fear or to despair of under her guidance , her patronage , her protection . These principles laid_down , and to return to our design , who_will not see that_we_have with good_reason claimed for Mary that as the constant companion of Jesus from the house -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth to the height of Calvary , as beyond all others initiated to the secrets of his Heart , and as the distributor , by right of her Motherhood , of the treasures of His merits , she_-isaia- , for all these reasons , a most sure and efficacious assistance to us for arriving -atti_degli_apostoli- the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ . Those , alas ! furnish us by their conduct with a peremptory proof of it , who seduced by the wiles of the demon or deceived by false doctrines think they_can do without_the help of the Virgin . Hapless are they_who neglect Mary under pretext of the honor to be paid to Jesus Christ ! As if the Child could be found elsewhere than with the Mother ! . Under these circumstances , Venerable Brethren , it -isaia- this_end which all the solemnities that_are everywhere being prepared in honor of the holy and Immaculate Conception of Mary should_have in view . No homage -isaia- more agreeable to her , none -isaia- sweeter to her than that_we_should know and really love Jesus Christ . Let then crowds fill the churches let solemn feasts be celebrated and public rejoicings be made : these_are things eminently suited for enlivening our_faith . But unless heart and will be added , they_will all be empty forms , mere appearances of piety . At such a spectacle , the Virgin , borrowing the words of Jesus Christ , would address us with the just reproach : '' This people honoureth me with_their lips , but their heart_-isaia- far from me '' Matth . For to be right and good , worship of the Mother of God ought to spring from the heart ; acts of the body have here neither utility nor value if the acts of the soul have no part in them . Now these latter can_only have one object , which_-isaia- that_we_should fully carry_out what_the divine Son of Mary commands . For if true love alone has the power to unite the wills of men , it -isaia- of the first necessity that_we_should have one will with Mary to serve Jesus our Lord . What this_most prudent Virgin said to the servants -atti_degli_apostoli- the marriage feast of Cana she addresses also to us : '' Whatsoever he shall say to you , do ye '' John ii . Now here -isaia- the word of Jesus Christ : '' If you would enter_into life , keep the commandments '' Matt . Let them each_one fully convince himself of this , that if his piety towards_the Blessed Virgin does_not hinder him from sinning , or does_not move his_will to amend an evil life , it -isaia- a piety deceptive and Iying , wanting as it -isaia- in proper effect and its natural fruit . If anyone desires a confirmation of this it may easily be found in the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of Mary . For leaving aside tradition which , as well as Scripture , -isaia- a source of truth , how has this persuasion of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin appeared so conformed to the Catholic mind and feeling that it has_been held as being one , and as it were inborn in the soul of the faithful ? '' We shrink from saying , '' -isaia- the answer of Dionysius of Chartreux , '' of this woman who_was to crush the head of the serpent that had_been crushed by him and that Mother of God that_she had ever been a daughter of the Evil One '' Sent . No , to the Christian intelligence the idea -isaia- unthinkable that the flesh of Christ , holy , stainless , innocent , was formed in the womb of Mary of a flesh which_had ever , if only_for the briefest moment , contracted any stain . And why so , but because an infinite opposition separates God from sin ? There certainly we have_the origin of the conviction common to all Christians that Jesus Christ before , clothed in human_nature , He cleansed us from our sins in His blood , accorded Mary the grace and special privilege of being preserved and exempted , from the first moment of her conception , from all stain of original_sin . If then God has such a horror of sin as to have willed to keep free the future Mother of His Son not_only from stains which_are voluntarily contracted but , by a special favor and in prevision of the merits of Jesus Christ , from that other stain of which_the sad sign -isaia- transmitted to all us sons of Adam by a sort of hapless heritage : who_can doubt that_it_-isaia- a duty for everyone who seeks by his homage to gain the heart of Mary to correct his vicious and depraved habits and to subdue the passions which incite him to evil ? . Whoever moreover wishes , and no one ought not so to wish , that_his devotion should be worthy of her and perfect , should go further and strive might and main to imitate her example . It -isaia- a divine_law that_those only attain everlasting happiness who_have by such faithful following reproduced in themselves the form of the patience and sanctity of Jesus Christ : '' for_whom He foreknew , He also predestined to be made conformable to the image of His Son ; that He might be the first born amongst many brethren '' Romans viii . But such generally -isaia-_our infirmity that_we_are easily discouraged by the greatness of such an example : by the providence of God , however , another example -isaia- proposed to us , which_-isaia- both as near to Christ as human_nature allows , and more nearly accords with the weakness of our nature . And this_-isaia- no other_than the Mother of God . '' Such was Mary , '' very pertinently points_out St . Ambrose , '' that her life_-isaia- an example for all . '' And , therefore , he rightly concludes : '' Have then before your eyes , as an image , the virginity and life of Mary from whom as from a mirror shines_forth the brightness of chastity and the form of virtue '' De Virginib . Now if it becomes children not to omit the imitation of any of the virtues of this_most Blessed Mother , we yet wish that_the_faithful apply themselves by preference to the principal virtues which_are , as it were , the nerves and joints of the Christian life we mean faith , hope , and charity towards God and our neighbor . Of these virtues the life of Mary bears in all its phases the brilliant character ; but_they attained their highest degree of splendor -atti_degli_apostoli- the time_when she stood by her dying Son . Jesus -isaia- nailed to the cross , and the malediction -isaia- hurled against Him that '' He made Himself the Son of God '' John xix . But she unceasingly recognized and adored the divinity in Him . She bore His dead body to the tomb , but never for a moment doubted that He would rise again . Then the love of God with_which she burned made her a partaker in the sufferings of Christ and the associate in His passion ; with_him moreover , as if forgetful of her_own sorrow , she prayed for the pardon of the executioners although they in their hate cried out : '' His blood be upon us and upon our children '' Matth . But lest it be thought that We have lost sight of Our subject , which_-isaia- the Immaculate Conception , what great and effectual succour will be found in it for the preservation and right development of those same virtues . What truly -isaia- the point of departure of the enemies of religion for the sowing of the great and serious errors by which_the faith of so many -isaia- shaken ? They begin by denying that_man has fallen by sin and been cast down from his former position . Hence they regard as mere fables original_sin and the evils that were its consequence . Humanity vitiated in its source vitiated in its turn the whole race of man ; and thus was evil introduced amongst men and the necessity for a Redeemer involved . All this rejected it -isaia- easy to understand_that no place -isaia- left for Christ , for the Church , for grace or for anything that_-isaia- above and beyond nature ; in one word the whole edifice of faith_-isaia- shaken from top to bottom . But let people believe and confess that the Virgin Mary has_been from the first moment of her conception preserved from all stain ; and it -isaia- straightway necessary that_they_should admit both original_sin and the rehabilitation of the human_race by Jesus Christ , the Gospel , and the Church and the law of suffering . By virtue of this Rationalism and Materialism -isaia- torn up by the roots and destroyed , and there remains to Christian wisdom the glory of having to guard and protect the truth . It -isaia- moreover a vice common to the enemies of the faith of our_time especially that_they repudiate and proclaim_the necessity of repudiating all respect and obedience for the authority of the Church , and even of any human power , in the idea that it will thus be more easy to make an end of faith . Here we have_the origin of Anarchism , than which nothing_-isaia- more pernicious and pestilent to the order of things whether natural or supernatural . Now this plague , which_-isaia- equally fatal to society -atti_degli_apostoli- large and to Christianity , finds_its ruin in the dogma of the Immaculate Conception by the obligation which it imposes of recognizing in the Church a power before which not_only has the will to bow , but the intelligence to subject itself . It -isaia- from a subjection of the reason of this_sort that Christian people sing thus_the praise of the Mother of God : '' Thou art all fair , O Mary , and the stain of original_sin -isaia- not in thee . And thus once_again -isaia- justified what_the Church attributes to this august Virgin that_she has exterminated all heresies in the world . And if , as the Apostle declares , faith_-isaia- nothing else than the substance of things to be hoped for '' Hebr . everyone will easily allow that_our faith_-isaia- confirmed and our_hope aroused and strengthened by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin . The Virgin was kept the more free_from all stain of original_sin because_she was to be the Mother of Christ ; and she_was the Mother of Christ that the hope of everlasting happiness might be born again in our souls . Leaving aside charity towards God , who_can contemplate the Immaculate Virgin without feeling moved to fulfill that precept which Christ called peculiarly His own , namely that of loving one_another as He loved us ? '' A great sign , '' thus_the Apostle St . John describes a vision divinely sent him , appears in the heavens : '' A woman clothed with the sun , and with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars upon her head '' Apoc . Everyone knows that_this woman signified the Virgin Mary , the stainless one_who brought forth our Head . The Apostle continues : '' And , being with child , she cried travailing in birth , and was in pain to be delivered '' Apoc . John therefore saw the Most Holy Mother of God already in eternal happiness , yet travailing in a mysterious childbirth . What birth was it ? Surely it was_the birth of us who , still in exile , are yet to be generated to the perfect charity of God , and to eternal happiness . And the birth pains show the love and desire with_which_the Virgin from heaven above watches over us , and strives with unwearying prayer to bring_about the fulfillment of the number of the elect . This same charity we desire_that all should earnestly endeavor to attain , taking special occasion from the extraordinary feasts in honour of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin . Oh how bitterly and fiercely -isaia- Jesus Christ now being persecuted , and the most_holy religion which he founded ! And how grave -isaia- the peril that threatens many of being drawn away by the errors that_are afoot on all sides , to the abandonment of the faith ! '' Then let him_who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall '' I Cor . And let all , with humble prayer and entreaty , implore of God , through the intercession of Mary , that_those_who have abandoned the truth may repent . We know , indeed , from experience that_such prayer , born of charity and relying on the Virgin , has_never been vain . True , even in the future the strife against the Church will_never cease , '' for there_must be also heresies , that_they also who_are reproved may be made manifest among_you '' I Cor . But neither will the Virgin ever cease to succor us in our trials , however grave they be , and to carry on the fight fought by her since her conception , so that_every day we may repeat : '' To day the head of the serpent of old was crushed by her '' Office Immac . And that heavenly graces may help Us more abundantly than usual during_this year in which We pay her fuller honour , to attain the imitation of the Virgin , and that thus We may more_easily secure Our object of restoring all things in Christ , We have determined , after_the example of Our Predecessors -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of their Pontificates , to grant to the Catholic world an extraordinary indulgence in the form of a Jubilee . Wherefore , confiding in the mercy of Almighty God and in the authority of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul , by virtue of that power of binding and loosing which , unworthy though We are , the Lord has_given Us , We do concede and impart the most plenary indulgence of all their sins to the faithful , all and several of both sexes , dwelling in this Our beloved City , or coming into it , who from the first Sunday in Lent , that_-isaia- from the st of February , to the second day of June , the solemnity of the Most Sacred Body of Christ , inclusively , shall three times visit one of the four Patriarchal basilicas , and there for some time pray God for the liberty and exaltation of the Catholic Church and this Apostolic See , for the extirpation of heresies and the conversion of all who_are in error , for the concord of Christian Princes and the peace and unity of all the faithful , and according to Our intention ; and who , within_the said period , shall fast once , using only meager fare , excepting the days not included in the Lenten Indult ; and , after confessing their sins , shall receive the most_holy Sacrament of the Eucharist ; and to all others , wherever they be , dwelling outside this city , who , within_the time above mentioned or during a space of three months , even not continuous , to be definitely appointed by the ordinaries according to the convenience of the faithful , but before the eighth day of December , shall three times visit the cathedral church , if there be one , or , if not , the parish church ; or , in the absence of this , the principal church ; and shall devoutly fulfill the other works abovementioned . And We do -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time permit that_this indulgence , which_-isaia- to be gained only once , may be applied in suffrage for the souls which_have passed from this_life united in charity with God . We do , moreover , concede that travelers by land or sea may gain the same indulgence immediately they return to their homes provided they perform the works already noted . To confessors approved by their_respective ordinaries We grant faculties for commuting the above works enjoined by Us for other works of piety , and this concession shall be applicable not_only to regulars of both sexes but to all others_who cannot perform the works prescribed , and We do grant faculties also to dispense from Communion children who have_not yet been admitted to it . Moreover to the faithful , all and several , the laity and the clergy both secular and regular of all orders and institutes , even_those calling for special mention , We do grant permission and power , for_this sole object , to select any priest regular or secular , among_those actually approved which faculty may also be used by nuns , novices and other women living in the cloister , provided the confessor they select be one approved for nuns by whom , when they_have confessed to him within_the prescribed time with the intention of gaining the present jubilee and of fulfilling all the other works requisite for gaining it , they_may on this sole occasion and only in the forum of conscience be absolved from all excommunication , suspension and every_other ecclesiastical sentence and censure pronounced or inflicted for_any cause by the law or by a judge , including those reserved to the ordinary and to Us or to the Apostolic See , even in cases reserved in a special manner to anybody whomsoever and to Us and to the Apostolic See ; and they_may also be absolved from all sin or excess , even_those reserved to the ordinaries themselves and to Us and to the Apostolic See , on condition however that a salutary penance be enjoined together_with_the other prescriptions of the law , and in the case of heresy after_the abjuration and retraction of error as -isaia- enjoined by the law ; and the said priests may further commute to other pious and salutary works all vows even_those taken under oath and reserved to the Apostolic See except those of chastity , of religion , and of obligations which_have_been accepted by a third person ; and with the said penitents , even regulars , in sacred orders such confessions may dispense from all secret irregularities contracted solely by violation of censures affecting the exercise of said orders and promotion to higher orders . But We do not intend by the present Letters to dispense from any irregularities whatsoever , or from crime or defect , public or private , contracted in any manner through notoriety or other incapacity or inability ; nor do We intend to derogate from the Constitution with its accompanying declaration , published by Benedict XIV , of happy_memory , which begins with the words Sacramentum poenitentiae ; nor_-isaia- it Our intention that_these present Letters may , or can , in any_way avail those_who , by Us and the Apostolic See , or by any ecclesiastical judge , have_been by name excommunicated , suspended , interdicted or declared under other sentences or censures , or who_have_been publicly denounced , unless they do within_the allotted time satisfy , or , when necessary , come to an arrangement with the parties concerned . To all this We are pleased to add that We do concede and will that all retain during_this time of Jubilee the privilege of gaining all other indulgences , not excepting plenary indulgences , which_have_been granted by Our Predecessors or by Ourself . We close these letters , Venerable Brethren , by manifesting anew the great hope We earnestly cherish that_through this extraordinary gift of Jubilee granted by Us under the auspices of the Immaculate Virgin , large numbers of those_who_are unhappily separated_from Jesus Christ may return to Him , and that_love of virtue and fervor of devotion may flourish anew among the Christian people . Fifty years_ago , when Pius IX , proclaimed as an article of faith the Immaculate Conception of the most Blessed Mother of Christ , it seemed , as we have_already said , as if an incredible wealth of grace were poured out upon the earth ; and with the increase of confidence in the Virgin Mother of God , the old religious spirit of the people was everywhere greatly augmented . Is it forbidden us to hope_for still greater things for the future ? True , we are passing through disastrous times , when we may well make our_own the lamentation of the Prophet : '' There -isaia- no truth and no mercy and no knowledge of God on the earth . Blasphemy and Iying and homicide and theft and adultery have inundated it '' Os . Yet in the midst of this deluge of evil , the Virgin Most Clement rises before our_eyes like a rainbow , as the arbiter of peace between God and man : '' I will set my bow in the clouds and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me and between_the earth '' Gen . Let the storm rage and sky darken not_for that shall we be dismayed . '' And the bow shall be in the clouds , and I shall see it and shall remember the everlasting covenant '' Ibid . '' And there shall no more be waters of a flood to destroy all flesh '' Ibid . Oh yes , if we trust as we should in Mary , now especially_when we are about to celebrate , with more_than usual fervor , her Immaculate Conception , we shall recognize in her that Virgin most powerful '' who with virginal foot did crush the head of the serpent '' Off . In pledge of these graces , Venerable Brethren , We impart the Apostolic Benediction lovingly in the Lord to you and to your_people . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome in St .
