We are about to discharge today a very grave obligation of Our office , an obligation which We assumed towards you when We announced , after_the promulgation of the law creating a rupture between_the French Republic and the Church , that We should indicate -atti_degli_apostoli- a fitting time what it might seem to Us ought to be done to defend and preserve religion in your_country . We have allowed you to wait until today for the satisfaction of your desires , by reason not_only of the importance of this_great question , but_also and above all by reason of the quite special charity_which binds Us to you and to all your interests because of the unforgettable services rendered to the Church by your nation . Therefore , after_having condemned , as was Our duty , this iniquitous law , We have examined with greatest care whether the articles of the said law would leave Us any means of organizing religious_life in France in such_a_way as to safeguard from injury the sacred principles on which Holy Church reposes . To this_end it appeared good to Us both to take the counsel of the assembled episcopate and to prescribe for your general_assembly the points which ought to be the principal objects of your deliberations . And now , knowing your views as well as those of several cardinals , and after_having maturely reflected and implored by the most fervent prayers the Father of Lights , We see_that We ought to confirm fully by Our Apostolic authority the almost unanimous decision of your assembly . It -isaia- for_this reason_that , with reference to the associations for public worship as the law establishes them , we decree that_it_-isaia- absolutely impossible for them to be formed without a violation of the sacred rights pertaining to the very life of the Church . Putting aside , therefore , these associations which_the knowledge of Our duty forbids us to approve , it might appear opportune to examine whether it -isaia- lawful to make trial in their place of some other sort of associations -atti_degli_apostoli- once legal and canonical , and thus to preserve the Catholics of France from the grave complications which menace them . Of a certainty , nothing so engrosses and distresses Us as these eventualities ; and would to Heaven that We had some hope of being able , without infringing the rights of God , to make_this essay , and thus to deliver Our well beloved_sons from the fear of such manifold and such_great trials . But as this hope fails Us while the law remains what it -isaia- , We declare that_it_-isaia- not permissible to try this other kind of association as long as it -isaia- not established in a sure and legal manner that the Divine constitution of the Church , the immutable rights of the Roman Pontiff and of the Bishops , as well as their authority over the necessary property of the Church and particularly over the sacred edifices , shall be irrevocably placed in the said associations in full security . To desire the contrary -isaia- impossible for us , without betraying the sanctity of Our office and bringing_about the ruin of the Church of France . It remains , therefore , for you , Venerable Brethren , to set yourselves to work and to employ all means which_the law recognizes as within_the rights of all citizens to arrange for and organize religious worship . In a matter so important and so arduous you will_never have to wait for Our assistance . Absent in body , We shall be with you in thought and in heart , and We shall aid you on every occasion with Our counsel and with Our authority . Take up with courage the burden We impose upon you under the inspiration of Our love for the Church and for your_country , and entrust the result to the all foreseeing goodness of God , Whose help , We are firmly convinced , will_not , in His own good time , be wanting to France . It -isaia- not difficult to foresee the nature of the recriminations which_the enemies of the Church will_make against Our present decree and Our orders . They will endeavor to persuade the people that We have_not had the interests of the Church of France solely in view ; that We have_had another design foreign to religion ; that the form of the Republic in France -isaia- hateful to Us , that in order to overthrow it We are seconding the efforts of the parties hostile to it ; and that We refuse to France what_the Holy See has without difficulties accorded to other nations . These recriminations , with_others of the same sort , which , as can be foreseen from certain indications , will be disseminated among the public in order to excite irritation , We denounce now and henceforth with the utmost indignation as false ; and it -isaia- incumbent upon you , Venerable Brethren , as upon all good men , to refute them in order that_they_may not deceive simple and ignorant people . With reference to the special charge against the Church of having_been more accommodating in a similar case outside France , you_should explain that the Church has acted in this_way because the situations were quite different , and above all because the Divine attributes of the hierarchy were , in a certain measure , safeguarded . If any State has separated_from the Church , while leaving to her the resource of the liberty common to all and the free disposal of her property , that State has without_doubt , and on more_than one ground , acted unjustly ; but nevertheless , it could_not be said_that it has created for the Church a situation absolutely intolerable . But it -isaia- quite otherwise today in France ; there the makers of this unjust law wished to make it a law , not of separation , but of oppression . Thus they affirmed their desire_for peace , and promised an understanding ; and they_are now waging an atrocious war against the religion of the country and hurling the brand of the most violent discords , and thus inciting the citizens against each_other , to the great detriment , as every_one sees , of the public welfare itself . Assuredly they_will tax their ingenuity to throw upon Us the blame for_this conflict and for the evils resulting therefrom . But whoever loyally examines the facts of which We have spoken in the Encyclical Vehementer Nos will_be_able to see whether We have deserved the least reproach We , who , after_having patiently borne with injustice upon injustice in Our love for the beloved French nation , finally find Ourselves summoned to go beyond_the last holy limits of Our Apostolic duty , and We declare that We will_not go beyond them or rather whether the fault does_not lie entirely with_those_who in hate of the Apostolic name have gone to such extremities . Therefore , if they desire to show Us their submission and their devotion , let_the Catholic men of France struggle for the Church in accordance_with_the directions We have_already given them , that_-isaia- to say , with perseverance and energy , and yet without acting in a seditious and violent manner . It -isaia- not by violence , but by firmness , that , fortifying themselves in their good right as within a citadel , they_will succeed in breaking the obstinacy of their enemies ; let_them well understand , as We have_said and as we repeat that their_efforts will be useless unless they unite in a perfect understanding for the defense of religion . They now know Our verdict on the subject of this nefarious law : they_should wholeheartedly conform to it , and whatever the opinions of some or others of them may have_been hitherto during the discussion of the question , We entreat them all that_no_one shall permit himself to wound anyone whomsoever on the pretext that_his own_way of seeing things -isaia- the best . What can be done by concord of will and union of forces , let_them learn from their adversaries ; and just as the latter were able to impose on the nation the stigma of this criminal law , so by their united action will our people be able to eliminate and remove it . In this hard trial of France , if all those_who wish to defend with all their_power the supreme interests of their_country work as they ought to do in union among_themselves with_their Bishops and with Ourselves for the cause of religion , far from despairing of the welfare of the Church of France , it -isaia- to be hoped , on the contrary , that she_will be restored to her former prosperity and dignity . We in no way doubt_that the Catholics will fully comply with Our directions , and conform with Our desires : and We shall ardently seek to obtain for them by the intercession of Mary , the Immaculate Virgin , the aid of the Divine goodness . As a pledge of heavenly_gifts and in testimony of Our paternal benevolence , We impart with all Our heart_the Apostolic Benediction to you , Venerable Brethren , and to the whole French nation .

Lawrence , the Martyr , in the year , and the fourth of Our Pontificate", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto", "author_dob": "02/06/1835", "author_start": "04/08/1903", "author_end": "20/08/1914", "pontificate_years": 11}
