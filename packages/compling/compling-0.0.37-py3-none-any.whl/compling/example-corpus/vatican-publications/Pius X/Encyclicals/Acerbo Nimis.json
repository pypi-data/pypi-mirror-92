At this_very troublesome and difficult time , the hidden designs of God have conducted Our poor strength to the office of Supreme pastor , to rule_the entire flock of Christ . The enemy has , indeed , long been prowling about the fold and attacking it with_such subtle cunning that now , more_than_ever before , the prediction of the Apostle to the elders of the Church of Ephesus seems to be verified : '' I know_that . fierce wolves will get in among_you , and will_not spare the flock . '' Those who still are zealous for the glory of God are seeking the causes and reasons for_this decline in religion . Coming to a different explanation , each points_out , according_to_his own view , a different plan_for the protection and restoration of the kingdom of God on earth . But it seems to Vs , Venerable Brethren , that while we should_not overlook other considerations , We are forced to agree with_those_who hold that the chief cause of the present indifference and , as it were , infirmity of soul , and the serious evils that result from it , -isaia- to be found above all in ignorance of things divine . This -isaia- fully in accord with what God Himself declared through the Prophet Osee : '' And there_-isaia- no knowledge of God in the land . Cursing and lying and killing and theft and adultery have overflowed : and blood hath touched blood . Thereafter shall the land mourn , and everyone that dwelleth in it shall languish . It -isaia- a common complaint , unfortunately too well founded , that_there are large numbers of Christians in our own_time who_are entirely ignorant of those truths necessary_for salvation . And when we mention Christians , We refer not_only to the masses or to those in the lower walks of life_for these find some excuse for their ignorance in the fact_that the demands of their harsh employers hardly leave them time to take_care of themselves or of their dear ones but We refer to those especially who_do_not lack culture or talents and , indeed , are possessed of abundant knowledge regarding things of the world but live rashly and imprudently with_regard to religion . It -isaia- hard to find words to describe how profound -isaia- the darkness in which_they_are engulfed and , what_-isaia- most deplorable of all , how tranquilly they repose there . They rarely give thought to God , the Supreme Author and Ruler of all things , or to the teachings of the faith of Christ . They know nothing of the Incarnation of the Word of God , nothing of the perfect restoration of the human_race which He accomplished . Grace , the greatest of the helps for attaining eternal things , the Holy Sacrifice and the Sacraments by which we obtain grace , are entirely unknown to them . They have no conception of the malice and baseness of sin ; hence they show no anxiety to avoid sin or to renounce it . And so they arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- life s end in such a condition that , lest all hope of salvation be lost , the priest_-isaia- obliged to give in the last few moments of life a summary teaching of religion , a time which_should be devoted to stimulating the soul to greater love for God . And even this as too_often happens only_when the dying man_-isaia- not so sinfully ignorant as to look upon the ministration of the priest as useless , and then calmly faces the fearful passage to eternity without making his peace with God . And so Our Predecessor , Benedict XIV , had just cause to write : '' We declare that a great number of those_who_are condemned to eternal punishment suffer that everlasting calamity because of ignorance of those mysteries of faith_which must be known and believed in order to be numbered among the elect . There -isaia- then , Venerable Brethren , no reason_for wonder that the corruption of morals and depravity of life -isaia-_already so great , and ever increasingly greater , not_only among uncivilized peoples but_even in those very nations that are_called Christian . The Apostle Paul , writing to the Ephesians , repeatedly admonished them in these_words : '' But immorality and every uncleanness or covetousness , let it not_even be named among_you , as become saints ; or obscenity or foolish talk . '' He also places the foundation of holiness and sound morals upon a knowledge of divine things_which holds in check evil desires : '' See to it therefore , brethren_,_that you walk with care : not as unwise but as wise . Therefore , do not become foolish , but understand what_the will of the Lord -isaia- . For the will of man retains but little of that divinely implanted love of virtue and righteousness by which it was , as it were , attracted strongly toward_the real and not merely apparent good . Disordered by the stain of the first sin , and almost forgetful of God , its Author , it improperly turns every affection to a love of vanity and deceit . This erring will , blinded by its_own evil desires , has need therefore of a guide to lead it back to the paths of justice whence it has so unfortunately strayed . The intellect itself_-isaia- this guide , which need not be sought elsewhere , but_-isaia- provided by nature itself . It -isaia- a guide , though , that , if it lack its companion light , the knowledge of divine things , will be only an instance of the blind leading the blind so that both will fall_into the pit . The holy king David , praising God for the light of truth with_which He had illumined the intellect , exclaimed : '' The light of Thy countenance , O Lord , -isaia- signed upon us . '' Then he described the effect of this light by adding : '' Thou hast given gladness in my heart , '' gladness , that_-isaia- , which enlarges our_heart so that it runs in the way of God s Commandments . All this becomes evident on a little reflection . Christian teaching reveals God and His infinite perfection with far greater clarity than -isaia- possible by the human faculties alone . Nor -isaia- that all . This same Christian teaching also commands us to honor God by faith_,_which -isaia- of the mind , by hope , which_-isaia- of the will , by love , which_-isaia- of the heart ; and thus_the whole man_-isaia- subjected to the supreme Maker and Ruler of all things . The truly remarkable dignity of man as the son of the heavenly Father , in Whose image he -isaia- formed , and with Whom he -isaia- destined to live in eternal happiness , -isaia-_also revealed only by the doctrine of Jesus Christ . From this_very dignity , and from man s knowledge of it , Christ showed that_men should love one_another as brothers , and should live here as become children of light , '' not of revelry and drunkenness , not in debauchery and wantonness , not in strife and jealousy . '' He also bids us to place all our anxiety and care in the hands of God , for He will provide_for us ; He tells us to help the poor , to do good to those_who hate us , and to prefer the eternal welfare of the soul to the temporal goods of this_life . Without wishing to touch on every detail , nevertheless -isaia- it not true_that the proud man_-isaia- urged and commanded by the teaching of Christ to strive for humility , the source of true glory ? '' Whoever , therefore , humbles himself . he -isaia- the greatest in the kingdom_of_heaven . '' From that_same teaching we learn prudence of the spirit , and thereby we avoid prudence of the flesh ; we learn justice , by which we give to every man his due ; fortitude , which prepares us to endure all things and with steadfast heart suffer all things for the sake of God and eternal happiness ; and , last of all , temperance through_which we cherish even poverty borne out of love for God , nay , we even glory in the cross itself , unmindful of its shame . In fine , Christian teaching not_only bestows on the intellect the light by which it attains truth , but_from it our will draws that ardor by which_we_are raised up to God and joined with Him in the practice of virtue . We by no means wish to conclude that a perverse will and unbridled conduct may_not be joined with a knowledge of religion . Would to God that facts did_not too abundantly prove the contrary ! But We do maintain that the will cannot be upright nor the conduct good when_the mind -isaia- shrouded in the darkness of crass ignorance . A man_who walks with open eyes may , indeed , turn aside from the right path , but a blind man_-isaia- in much_more imminent danger of wandering away . Furthermore , there_-isaia- always some hope_for a reform of perverse conduct so long as the light_of_faith -isaia- not entirely extinguished ; but if lack of faith_-isaia- added to depraved morality because of ignorance , the evil hardly admits of remedy , and the road to ruin lies open . How many and how grave are the consequences of ignorance in matters of religion ! And on the other_hand , how necessary and how beneficial -isaia- religious instruction ! It -isaia- indeed vain to expect a fulfillment of the duties of a Christian by one who_does_not even know them . We must now consider upon whom rests the obligation to dissipate this_most pernicious ignorance and to impart in its stead the knowledge that_-isaia- wholly indispensable . There can be no doubt , Venerable Brethren , that_this most important duty rests upon all who_are pastors of souls . On them , by command of Christ , rest the obligations of knowing and of feeding the flocks committed to their care ; and to feed implies , first of all , to teach . '' I will_give you pastors according to my own heart , '' God promised through Jeremias , '' and they_shall feed you with knowledge and doctrine . '' Hence the Apostle Paul said : '' Christ did_not send me to baptize , but to preach_the_gospel , '' thereby indicating that the first duty of all those_who_are entrusted in any_way with the government of the Church -isaia- to instruct the faithful in the things of God . We do not think it necessary to set_forth here_the praises of such instruction or to point_out how meritorious it -isaia- in God s sight . If , assuredly , the alms with_which we relieve the needs of the poor are highly praised by the Lord , how much_more precious in His eyes , then , will be the zeal and labor expended in teaching and admonishing , by which we provide not_for the passing needs of the body but_for the eternal profit of the soul ! Nothing , surely , -isaia- more desirable , nothing_more acceptable to Jesus Christ , the Savior of souls , Who testifies of Himself through Isaias : '' To bring good_news to the poor he has_sent me . Here then it -isaia- well to emphasize and insist that_for a priest there_-isaia- no duty more grave or obligation more binding than_this . Who , indeed , will deny that knowledge should be joined to holiness of life in the priest ? '' For the lips of the priest shall keep knowledge . '' The Church demands this knowledge of those_who_are to be ordained to the priesthood . Why ? Because the Christian people expect from them knowledge of the divine_law , and it was for that end that_they were sent by God . '' And they_shall seek the law -atti_degli_apostoli- his mouth ; because he -isaia- the angel of the Lord of hosts . '' Thus the bishop speaking to the candidates_for_the_priesthood in the ordination ceremony says : '' Let your teaching be a spiritual remedy for God s people ; may_they be worthy fellow workers of our order ; and thus meditating day and night on His law , they_may believe what_they read , and teach what they_shall believe . If what We have just said -isaia- applicable to all priests , does it not apply with much greater force to those_who possess the title and the authority of parish priests , and who , by virtue of their rank and in a sense by virtue of a contract , hold the office of pastors of souls ? These are , to a certain extent , the pastors and teachers appointed by Christ in order that_the_faithful might not be as '' children , tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine devised in the wickedness of men , '' but_that practicing '' the truth in love , '' they_may , '' grow up in all things in him_who_-isaia- the head , Christ . For this_reason_the Council of Trent , treating of the duties of pastors of souls , decreed that_their first and most important work_-isaia- the instruction of the faithful . It therefore prescribes that they_shall teach the truths of religion on Sundays and on the more solemn feast days ; moreover during the holy seasons of Advent and Lent they_are to give such instruction every_day or -atti_degli_apostoli- least three times a week . This , however , was_not considered enough . The Council provided for the instruction of youth by adding that the pastors , either personally or through others , must explain the truths of religion -atti_degli_apostoli- least on Sundays and feast days to the children of the parish , and inculcate obedience to God and to their_parents . When the Sacraments are to be administered , it enjoins upon pastors the duty to explain their efficacy in plain and simple language . These prescriptions of the Council of Trent have_been summarized and still more_clearly defined by Our Predecessor , Benedict XIV , in his Constitution Esti minime . '' Two chief obligations , '' he wrote , '' have_been imposed by the Council of Trent on those_who_have the care of souls : first , that of preaching the things of God to the people on the feast days ; and second , that of teaching the rudiments of faith and of the divine_law to the youth and others_who need such instruction . '' Here the wise Pontiff rightly distinguishes between these_two duties : one_-isaia- what_-isaia- commonly known as the explanation of the Gospel and the other -isaia- the teaching of Christian doctrine . Perhaps there_are_some who , wishing to lessen their labors , would believe_that the homily on the Gospel can take the place of catechetical instruction . But for one_who reflects a moment , such_-isaia- obviously impossible . The sermon on the holy Gospel -isaia- addressed to those_who should have_already received knowledge of the elements of faith . It -isaia- , so to speak , bread broken for adults . Catechetical instruction , on the other_hand , -isaia- that milk which_the Apostle Peter wished the faithful to desire in all simplicity like newborn babes . The task of the catechist -isaia- to take up one or other of the truths of faith or of Christian morality and then explain it in all its parts ; and since amendment of life_-isaia- the chief aim of his instruction , the catechist must needs make a comparison between what God commands us to do and what_-isaia- our actual conduct . After this , he will use examples appropriately taken from the Holy Scriptures , Church history , and the lives of the saints thus moving his hearers and clearly pointing out to them how they_are to regulate their_own conduct . He should , in conclusion , earnestly exhort all present to dread and avoid vice and to practice virtue . We are indeed aware_that the work of teaching the Catechism -isaia- unpopular with many because as a rule it -isaia- deemed of little account and for the reason_that it does_not lend itself easily to the winning of public praise . But this in Our opinion -isaia- a judgment based on vanity and devoid of truth . We do not disapprove of those pulpit orators who , out of genuine zeal for the glory of God , devote_themselves to defense of the faith and to its spread , or who eulogize the saints of God . But their labor presupposes labor of another kind , that of the catechist . And so if this be lacking , then the foundation -isaia- wanting ; and they labor in vain who build the house . Too often it happens_that ornate sermons which receive the applause of crowded congregations serve but to tickle the ears and fail utterly to touch the hearts of the hearers . Catechetical instruction , on the other_hand , plain and simple though it be , -isaia- the word of which God Himself speaks through the lips of the prophet Isaias : '' And as the rain and the snow come down from heaven , and return no more thither , but soak the earth and water it , and make it to spring and give seed to the sower and bread to the eater : so shall my word be , which shall go forth_from my mouth . It shall_not return to me void , but it shall do whatsoever I please and shall prosper in the things for_which I sent it . '' We believe the same may be said of those priests_who work hard to produce books which explain the truths of religion . They are surely to be commended for their zeal , but how_many are there who read these works and take from them a fruit commensurate with the labor and intention of the writers ? The teaching of the Catechism , on the other_hand , when rightly done , never fails to profit those_who listen to it . In order to enkindle the zeal of the ministers of God , We again insist on the need to reach the ever_increasing numbers of those_who know nothing -atti_degli_apostoli- all of religion , or who possess -atti_degli_apostoli- most only such knowledge of God and Christian truths as befits idolaters . How many there_are , alas , not_only among the young , but among adults and those advanced in years , who know nothing of the chief mysteries of faith ; who on hearing the name of Christ can_only ask ? '' Who -isaia- he . that I may believe in him ? '' In consequence of this ignorance , they_do_not consider it a crime to excite and nourish hatred against their neighbor , to enter_into most unjust contracts , to do business in dishonest fashion , to hold the funds of others -atti_degli_apostoli- an exorbitant interest rate , and to commit other iniquities no less reprehensible . They are , moreover , ignorant of the law of Christ which not_only condemns immoral actions but_also forbids deliberate immoral thoughts and desires . Even when for some reason or other they avoid sensual pleasures , they nevertheless entertain evil thoughts without_the least scruple , thereby multiplying their sins above the number of the hairs of the head . These persons are_found , we deem it necessary to repeat , not merely among the poorer classes of the people or in sparsely settled districts , but_also among_those in the higher walks of life , even , indeed , among_those puffed up with learning , who , relying upon a vain erudition , feel free to ridicule religion and to '' deride whatever they_do_not know . Now , if we cannot expect to reap a harvest when no seed has_been planted , how_can we hope to have a people_with sound morals if Christian doctrine has not_been imparted to them in due time ? It follows , too , that if faith languishes in our days , if among large numbers it has almost vanished , the reason -isaia- that the duty of catechetical teaching_-isaia- either fulfilled very superficially or altogether neglected . It will_not do to say , in excuse , that faith_-isaia- a free gift of God bestowed upon each_one -atti_degli_apostoli- Baptism . True enough , when we are baptized in Christ , the habit of faith_-isaia- given , but this_most divine seed , if left entirely to itself , by its_own power , so to speak , -isaia- not like the mustard seed which '' grows up . and puts out great branches . '' Man has the faculty of understanding -atti_degli_apostoli- his birth , but he also_has need of his_mother s word to awaken it , as it were , and to make it active . So too , the Christian , born again of water and the Holy Spirit , has faith within him , but he requires the word of the teaching Church to nourish and develop it and to make it bear_fruit . Thus wrote the Apostle : '' Faith then depends on hearing , and hearing on the word of Christ '' ; and to show the necessity of instruction , he added , '' How are they to hear , if no one preaches ? '' . What We have_said so far demonstrates the supreme importance of religious instruction . We ought , therefore , to do all that lies in our power to maintain the teaching of Christian doctrine with full vigor , and where such_-isaia- neglected , to restore it ; for in the words of Our Predecessor , Benedict XIV , '' There -isaia- nothing more_effective than catechetical instruction to spread the glory of God and to secure the salvation_of_souls . We , therefore , Venerable Brethren , desirous of fulfilling this_most important obligation of Our Teaching Office , and likewise wishing to introduce uniformity everywhere in so weighty a matter , do by Our Supreme Authority enact the following regulations and strictly command that_they be observed and carried_out in all dioceses of the world . On every Sunday and holy day , with no exception , throughout_the year , all parish priests and in general all those having the care of souls , shall instruct the boys and girls , for the space of an hour from the text of the Catechism on those_things they_must believe and do in order to attain salvation . At certain times throughout_the year , they_shall prepare boys and girls to receive properly the Sacraments of Penance and Confirmation , by a continued instruction over a period of days . With a very_special zeal , on every_day in Lent and , if necessary , on the days following Easter , they_shall instruct with the use of apt illustrations and exhortations the youth of both sexes to receive their first Communion in a holy manner . In each_and_every parish the society known as the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine -isaia- to be canonically established . Through this Confraternity , the pastors , especially in places_where there_-isaia- a scarcity of priests , will_have lay helpers in the teaching of the Catechism , who will_take up the work of imparting knowledge both from a zeal for the glory of God and in order to gain the numerous Indulgences granted by the Sovereign Pontiffs . In the larger cities , and especially where universities , colleges and secondary schools are located , let classes in religion be organized to instruct in the truths of faith and in the practice of Christian life the youths who attend the public schools from which all religious teaching_-isaia- banned . Since it -isaia- a fact_that in these_days adults need instruction no less_than the young , all pastors and those having the care of souls shall explain the Catechism to the people in a plain and simple style adapted to the intelligence of their hearers . This shall be carried_out on all holy days of obligation , -atti_degli_apostoli- such time as -isaia- most convenient for the people , but_not during the same hour when_the children are instructed , and this instruction must be in addition to the usual homily on the Gospel which_-isaia- delivered -atti_degli_apostoli- the parochial Mass on Sundays and holy days . The catechetical instruction shall be based on the Catechism of the Council of Trent ; and the matter -isaia- to be divided in such_a_way_that in the space of four or five years , treatment will be given to the Apostles Creed , the Sacraments , the Ten Commandments , the Lord s Prayer and the Precepts of the Church . Venerable Brethren , We decree and command this by virtue of Our Apostolic Authority . It now rests with you to put it into prompt and complete execution in your respective dioceses , and by the power of your authority to see_to_it_that these prescriptions of Ours be not neglected or , what amounts to the same thing , that_they be not carried_out carelessly or superficially . That this may be avoided , you_must exhort and urge your pastors not to impart these instructions without having first prepared themselves in the work . Then they_will not merely speak words of human wisdom , but '' in simplicity and godly sincerity , '' imitating the example of Jesus Christ , Who , though He revealed '' things hidden since_the foundation of the world , '' yet spoke '' all . things to the crowds in parables , and without parables . did_not speak to them . '' We know_that the Apostles , who_were taught by the Lord , did the same ; for of them Pope Saint Gregory wrote : '' They took supreme care to preach to the uninstructed simple truths easy to understand , not things deep and difficult . '' In matters of religion , the majority of men in our_times must be considered uninstructed . We do not , however , wish to give the impression that_this studied simplicity in imparting instruction does_not require labor and meditation on the contrary , it demands both more_than any_other kind of preaching . It -isaia- much easier to find a preacher capable of delivering an eloquent and elaborate discourse than a catechist who_can impart a catechetical instruction which_-isaia- praiseworthy in every detail . No matter what natural facility a person may_have in ideas and language , let_him always remember_that he will_never be able to teach Christian doctrine to children or to adults without first giving himself to very careful study and preparation . They are mistaken who think_that because of inexperience and lack of training of the people the work of catechizing can be performed in a slipshod fashion . On the contrary , the less educated the hearers , the more zeal and diligence must be used to adapt the sublime truths to their untrained minds ; these truths , indeed , far surpass the natural understanding of the people , yet must be known by all the uneducated and the cultured in order that_they_may arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- eternal happiness . And now , Venerable Brethren , permit Us to close this_letter by addressing to you these_words of Moses : '' If any man be on the Lord s side , let_him join with me . '' We pray and entreat you to reflect on the great loss of souls due solely to ignorance of divine things . You have doubtless accomplished many useful and most praiseworthy works in your respective dioceses for the good of the flock entrusted_to_your care , but before all else , and with all possible zeal and diligence and care , see to it and urge on others that the knowledge of Christian doctrine pervades and imbues fully and deeply the minds of all . Here , using the words of the Apostle Peter , We say , '' According to the gift that_each has_received , administer it to one_another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God . Through the intercession of the Most Blessed Immaculate Virgin , may your diligent efforts be made fruitful by the Apostolic Blessing which , in token of Our affection and as a pledge of heavenly favors , We wholeheartedly impart to you and to your clergy_and_people .
