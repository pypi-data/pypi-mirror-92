My soul magnifies the Lord , and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour Lk , . On the forthcoming Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary , her canticle of praise to God will be sung with_special devotion in the basilica of Esztergom Budapest , when_the Hungarian people commemorate the glorious event of the Baptism of their ancestors , by the work of St Stephen a thousand years_ago . This commemoration will certainly induce people to give thanks for the countless benefits received during_this millennium through the intercession of Our Lady , the great Lady of the Hungarians . On that_very day , I too , present in spirit with the clergy and the faithful gathered in the basilica of Esztergom Budapest , will join the Blessed Virgin s canticle : My soul magnifies the Lord , and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour . The '' Hungarian Millennium '' becomes an even_more illustrious event because you_are celebrating it on the solemn anniversary commemorating the death of St Stephen in the royal city of Esztergom , where long ago arrived the crown given to him by my venerable Predecessor Sylvester II . It -isaia-_now kept on view in the splendid basilica , in the very place_where the coronation took_place , where , with deep gratitude , the President , the Prime Minister of the Republic , representatives of the Government and the Public Council will gather , together_with_the magistrates of Esztergom , a multitude of the faithful and many public leaders of the Hungarian State . For Hungarians , this ancient crown -isaia- the symbol of their national identity , of their history and of the thousand year old culture of their kingdom and , adorned with the title of '' Sacred Crown '' , it -isaia- venerated as a relic by the people . May this deep spiritual meaning help the members of the present generation to build a future filled_with significant values on the foundations of the Christian institutions of yore . To the great advantage of the Hungarian people , divine Providence disposed that a thousand years_ago a man of extraordinary prudence , endowed_with exceptional ability and great wisdom , would receive from Pope Sylvester the crown with_which he was crowned during the Solemnity of Christmas in the year . It was_not long before the Hungarian State became independent and was added to the number of European kingdoms . Stephen did_not accept the crown as an honour , but a service ; he therefore , always and in all circumstances , sought the good of the community entrusted to him , both by organizing and defending the kingdom and by promulgating new decrees , as well as by fostering the development of the two cultures , the human and the divine . King Stephen was untainted by the allure of his advantages and successes and , having overcome the enticements of his time , he found a living source from which he drew the strength to guide his people_with faithful service . A writer has summed up this spiritual source concisely and with insight : In always presenting himself as though he were before the tribunal of Christ , whom he contemplated with the eyes of his_heart and a face such as to command respect , he showed that he had Christ on his lips and carried him in his_heart and in all his actions '' The Greater Legend of St Stephen '' , chap . , Writers of Hungarian history -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the commanders and of the kings of the \u00c1rp\u00e1dian Family , printed and edited by E . In the course of these , years , King Stephen has_always appeared as a shining example of family_life . Only one of his_children , Emeric , reached adolescence ; St Stephen paid great attention to his education and was careful to see_that he was enriched by the knowledge required -atti_degli_apostoli- the time . He was concerned_with his formation , which he entrusted to distinguished teachers including St Gerard , the future Bishop of Szeged Csanad and wanted a book to be prepared_for his use , which_would contain his reflections and rules for life . In this_way he trained his_son for life so as to make him worthy , both in knowledge and in conduct , to govern_the kingdom . However , since he died while he was still young he was unable to succeed his_father . King Stephen s family_-isaia- truly outstanding for its holiness . Honoured by his blessed wife , Gisela , and his holy son , Emeric , he was able to spread such virtue in the subsequent generations as to give rise to the just claim that the house of \u00c1rp\u00e1d has_given the Church countless saints and blesseds . These splendid lights of Christianity continue to spur us on to take the right path , following the signs of Christ . Ten centuries later , they are_still a warning to our generation that the virtues of family_life must be deeply esteemed and that the mission of educating children must_not be neglected . I therefore appropriately repeat what I said to people of the world of culture and science on the occasion of my Pastoral Visit to Hungary : '' One of the most important factors of culture -isaia- education . But this consists in transmitting to future generations a concise summary of the scientific and tecnological conquests achieved . However , an equal and even greater effort must be made in the field of educational formation . A reductive conception of man inevitably can cause serious harm to human formation '' John Paul II , Address to people of culture and science , August , n . ; L Osservatore Romano English edition , , p . Let us recall this marvellous man s particular approach to governing the State , which enabled him to deal successfully with the very serious commitments related to the organization of the kingdom . Historians writing on his_life mention that Stephen was constantly dedicated to prayer and that he always found the time to pray , despite being overwhelmed by the many affairs of government . His soul appears in the Libellus de institutione morum ad Emericum ducem A Manual on Moral Formation for the Duke Emeric , written for his_son , Emeric : '' The observance of prayer_-isaia- the greatest conquest of true salvation . Continuous prayer_-isaia- purification and the remission of sins . Then , my son , every time you go to God s house , do so in such_a_way as to adore God with Solomon , son of the king , and you yourself , as king , should_always say : '' Send , O Lord , Wisdom down from your glorious throne , that_she may be with me and work with me , and that I may learn what_-isaia- pleasing to you -atti_degli_apostoli- all times '' St Stephen , Libellus de institutione morum ad Emericum ducem , chap . : Writers of the History of Hungary , n . I would especially like to stress this feature , that_-isaia- , that -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the new millennium I attribute great_importance to cultivating a spirit of prayer , as I wrote in my recent Apostolic Letter : '' This training in holiness calls for a Christian life distinguished above all in the art of prayer . We have to learn to pray . Especially n the face of the many trials to which today_s_world subjects faith , they_would be not_only mediocre Christians that_-isaia- , ordinary Christians but '' Christians -atti_degli_apostoli- risk . They would run the insidious risk of seeing their_faith progressively undermined , and would perhaps end up succumbing to the allure of '' substitutes , accepting alternative religious proposals and even indulging in far fetched superstitions '' Novo Millennio ineunte , nn . St Stephen -isaia- portrayed holding the sacred crown in his hands whilst dedicating the kingdom and his_people to the '' great Lady of the Hungarians '' . To this_day , the Hungarian people adhere so strongly to this act of dedication that Marian devotion has become a national characteristic . I therefore remember with_joy that years_ago , during my Pastoral Visit to Hungary , after_the Mass celebrated in Budapest in Heroes Square , I renewed this offering of your homeland to the '' Great Lady of the Hungarians '' together_with_the entire Hungarian people ; it -isaia- fitting_that in coming to the conclusion of the '' Hungarian Millennium '' you now renew the same offering with the same prayer . May the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the Great Lady of the Hungarians , which your people_have so often experienced in their history , guide your ecclesiastical and civil leaders and your_country in this millennium on the way to development , progress , Christian virtues , solidarity and peace ! On this renowned feast of your_people , I gladly impart my Apostolic Blessing to you all . From Castel Gandolfo , July , the rd year of my Pontificate .
