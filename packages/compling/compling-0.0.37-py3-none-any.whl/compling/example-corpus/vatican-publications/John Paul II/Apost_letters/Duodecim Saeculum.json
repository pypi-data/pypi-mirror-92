The Twelfth Centenary of the Second Council of Nicaea was_the object of many ecclesial and academic celebrations in which_the Holy See itself took part . The event was_also commemorated by the publication of an Encyclical from His Holiness the Patriarch of Constantinople and of the Holy Synod , an initiative which underlines the theological importance and the ecumenical significance of the seventh and last Council fully recognized by both the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church . The doctrine defined by this Council concerning the lawfulness of the veneration of icons also merits special_attention , not_only_for the wealth of its spiritual implications , but_also_for the demands_that it imposes on the whole of sacred art . The importance given by Nicaea II to the argument of tradition , and more specifically the unwritten tradition , constitutes for us Catholics as well as for our Orthodox brethren an invitation to travel again together the road of the undivided Church , and to re examine in her light the differences between us that the centuries of separation have accentuated , in order to rediscover that for_which Jesus prayed to the Father cf . John , ; , full_communion in visible unity . In giving an account of the Council of Nicaea II to Pope Hadrian I , the moderator of the Council , Saint Taraise , wrote : '' having all taken our places we took Christ as our head . In fact , the Holy Gospel was placed on a throne , inviting all those present to judge according to justice . '' Putting Christ in evidence as the president of the conciliar assembly , which_was meeting in his_name and under his authority , was an eloquent gesture to affirm that the unity of the Church can_only achieved in obedience to its one Lord . The rulers Irene and Constantine VI , who convoked the Council , had invited my predecessor Hadrian I in his capacity as '' the real first pontiff who presides in the place and on the seat of the Saint and very venerable Apostle Peter . '' Hadrian I was represented by the archpriest of the Roman Church and the head of the Greek monastery of Saint Saba in Rome . To ensure the universal representation of the Church , the presence of the Eastern Patriarchs was_also required . Since their territories were already under Muslim domination , the Patriarchs Alexandria and Antioch sent a joint letter to Taraise , and the Patriarch of Jerusalem sent a synodal letter ; both of these were read -atti_degli_apostoli- the Council . It was accepted that the decisions of an Ecumenical Council were valid only if the Bishop of Rome had offered his collaboration and if the Eastern Patriarchs had given their agreement . In this_process , the role of the Church of Rome was recognized as irreplaceable . Thus Nicaea II approved the explanation of the deacon John according to which_the iconoclast meeting of Hieria of was_not legitimate because '' neither the Pope of Rome nor the bishops_who surround him had collaborated in it , either through_their legates or by an encyclical_letter , according to the law of the synods , '' and that the Patriarchs of the East . and the bishops_who are with_them had not given their consent to it . '' Besides , the Fathers of Nicaea declared that_they '' followed , received and accepted '' the letter sent by Hadrian to the emperors , as well as the one addressed to the Patriarch . Both were read in Latin and in their Greek translation , and all were invited to give their individual approval . In the papal legates the Council greeted the '' Church of the Holy Apostle Peter '' and of the '' Apostolic See , '' according to the Roman formula ; and the Patriarch Taraise , writing to my predecessor in the name of the Council , recognized in him the one '' who_has inherited the chair of the divine Apostle Peter , '' and who , '' vested with the supreme priesthood , presides legitimately , by the will of God , over the religious hierarchy . '' One of the decisive moments when_the Council pronounced in favor of re establishing the cult of images seems to have_been when_they unanimously accepted the proposal of the Roman legates to have a venerable icon brought to the meeting so that Fathers could pay homage of it . The last Ecumenical Council recognized by both the Catholic and Orthodox Churches -isaia- a remarkable example of collaboration between_the See of Rome and a conciliar assembly . It was set in the perspective of patristic ecclesiology of communion , founded on tradition , which_the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council has justly highlighted . Nicaea II solemnly affirmed the existence of '' written and unwritten ecclesiastical tradition , '' as the normative reference for the faith and discipline of the Church . The Fathers affirmed that_they wished to '' conserve intact all the traditions of the Church which_were entrusted to them , whether written or not . One of these consist precisely in the painting of icons , in conformity to the letter of apostolic preaching . '' Against the iconoclast current which_had also appealed to Scripture and the Tradition of the Fathers , especially in the pseudosynod of Hieria in , Nicaea II sanctioned the lawfulness of the veneration of images , confirming '' the divinely inspired teachings of the holy Fathers and the tradition of the Catholic Church . '' The Fathers of Nicaea II understood '' ecclesiastical tradition '' as that of the six previous ecumenical Councils and that of the orthodox Fathers whose teaching was commonly accepted in the Church . Thus the Council defined as being of the faith this essential truth according to which_the Christian message -isaia- '' tradition , '' paradosis . As the Church developed in time and space , her understanding of the tradition which_she carries has_also known stages of development , the study of which constitutes an obligatory itinerary for ecumenical dialogue and all authentic theological reflection . From Saint Paul we learn that , for the first Christian generation , the paradosis -isaia- the proclamation of the event of Christ and its actual meaning , which effects salvation through the action of the Holy Spirit cf . The tradition of the Lord s words and actions , without being exhausted cf . Luke , ; John , ; , was gathered in the four Gospels . This founding tradition -isaia- '' apostolic '' tradition cf . It concerns not_only the '' deposit '' of the '' true doctrine '' cf . , , but_also the norms of behavior and the rules for community life cf . The Church reads Scripture in the light of the '' rule of faith , '' that_-isaia- , of her living faith_that has remained faithful to the teaching of the Apostles . What the Church has_always believed and practiced , she justly considers as '' apostolic tradition . '' Saint Augustine says : '' An observance kept by the whole Church and always maintained without having_been instituted by the Councils , -isaia- regarded in all justice as nothing else than a tradition that emanates from the authority of the Apostles . '' In fact , the stand taken by the Fathers in the great theological debates of the fourth and fifth centuries of the growing importance of the synodal institution -atti_degli_apostoli- the regional and universal levels have gradually made of tradition the '' tradition of the Fathers , '' or the '' ecclesiastical tradition , '' conceived as the homogeneous development of apostolic tradition . Thus Saint Basil the Great appeals to the unwritten traditions '' which_are the '' traditions of the Fathers '' on which to base his Trinitarian theology , and he stresses the double origin of the Church s doctrine , '' from the written teaching as well as from apostolic tradition . '' The Council of Nicaea II which aptly quotes Saint Basil on the question of the theology of images also invokes the authority of the great orthodox doctors such as Saint John Chrysostom , Saint Gregory of Nyssa , Saint Cyril of Alexandria and Saint Gregory Nazianzen . Saint John Damascene also revealed the importance for the faith of '' unwritten traditions , '' that_-isaia- , not contained in Scripture , when he states : '' If somebody were to bring a Gospel other_than that_which the Catholic Church received_from_the holy Apostles , the Fathers and the Councils , and which_she has kept to our_day , do not listen to him . Closer to us , the Second Vatican Council has put in full light the importance of the '' tradition that comes_from_the Apostles . '' '' In fact , Sacred Scripture -isaia- the Word of God in that , under the inspiration of the Divine Spirit , it -isaia- put in writing ; as for Holy Tradition , it carries the Word of God , entrusted by the Lord Christ and the Holy Spirit to the Apostles , and fully transmitted to their successors . '' '' The Tradition received_from_the Apostles includes everything_that contributes to the holiness of life and increase in faith of the People of God . '' With Sacred Scripture , '' holy Tradition constitutes a sole sacred deposit of the word of God entrusted to the Church . '' The authentic interpretation of the '' word of God , written or transmitted , has_been entrusted to the one living magisterium of the Church whose authority_-isaia- exercised in the name of Jesus Christ . '' It -isaia- in equal fidelity to the common treasure of tradition which goes back to the Apostles that the Churches today are trying to examine carefully the reasons for their differences and how to overcome them . The terrible '' quarrel over images '' that tore the Byzantine Empire apart under the Isaurian emperors Leo III and Constantine V , between and , and again under Leo V , from to , -isaia- explained mainly by the theological debate which_was originally -atti_degli_apostoli- stake . Without ignoring the danger of an ever possible resurgence of the idolatrous practices of paganism , the Church permitted that the Lord , the Blessed Virgin Mary , the martyrs and the saints should be represented in pictorial form or in sculpture to sustain the prayer and devotion of the faithful . It was clear to everyone , according to Saint Basil s formula recalled -atti_degli_apostoli- Nicaea II , that '' the honor rendered to the icon reaches the prototype . '' In the West , Pope Saint Gregory the Great had insisted on the didactic aspect of the paintings in the churches , which_were useful for the illiterate '' to read on the walls what they_were incapable of reading in books , '' and stressed that_this contemplation should lead to the adoration of the '' one and omnipotent Holy Trinity . '' It -isaia- in that context that_there developed , particularly in Rome in the eighth century , the cult of images of the saints which gave rise to an admirable artistic production . In breaking with the authentic tradition of the Church , the iconoclast movement considered the veneration of images as a return to idolatry . Not without contradiction or ambiguity , they forbade representations of Christ and religious images in general but continued to allow profane images , in particular those of the Emperor with the signs of reverence that were attached to them . The basis of the iconoclast argument was of a Christological nature . How was it possible to depict Christ , who unites in his person , without confusing or separating them , the divine nature and the human Nature ? To represent his unfathomable divinity would be impossible ; to represent him in his humanity would only be to divide him , to separate the divinity and humanity in him . To choose one or the other of these options would lead to the opposed Christological heresies of Monophysitism and Nestorianism . For , in trying to represent Christ in his divinity , one would necessarily have to absorb his humanity ; in showing only a human picture , one would hide the fact that_he_-isaia- also God . The dilemma posed by the iconoclasts involved much more_than the question of the possibility of Christian art ; it called into question the whole Christian vision of the reality of the Incarnation and therefore the relationships of God and the world , grace and nature , in short , the specific character of the '' new_covenant '' that God made with humanity in Jesus Christ . The defenders of images saw it well : according to the Patriarch of Constantinople , Saint Germain , an illustrious victim of the iconoclast heresy , it -isaia- '' the divine economy according to the flesh '' that_was being questioned . For , to see represented the human face of the Son of God , '' image of the invisible God , '' Col . , , -isaia- to see the Word made_flesh cf . John , , the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world cf . Therefore art can represent the form , the effigy of God s human face and lead the one_who contemplates it to the ineffable mystery of God made man for our_salvation . Thus Pope Hadrian could write : '' By means of a visible face , our spirit will be carried by a spiritual attraction towards_the invisible majesty of the divinity through the contemplation of the image where -isaia- represented the flesh that the Son of God deigned to take for our_salvation . May we thus adore and praise him together while glorifying in spirit this_same Redeemer for , as it -isaia- written , God -isaia- Spirit , and that_-isaia-_why we spiritually adore his divinity . '' Hence , Nicaea II solemnly reaffirmed the traditional distinction between '' the true adoration latreia '' which '' according to our faith_-isaia- rendered to the unique divine nature '' and '' and the prostration of honor timetike proskynesis '' which_-isaia- attributed to icons , for '' he who prostrates before the icon does so before the person hypostasis who_-isaia- represented therein . '' Therefore the iconography of Christ involves the whole faith in the reality of the Incarnation and its inexhaustible meaning for the Church and the world . If the Church practices it , it -isaia- because_she -isaia- convinced_that the God revealed in Jesus Christ has truly redeemed and sanctified the flesh and the whole sensible world , that_-isaia- man with_his five senses , to allow him to be ever renewed in the image of his creator cf . Nicaea II sanctioned the tradition according to which '' venerable and holy images , done in color , mosaics and all other appropriate materials , of our Lord God and Savior Jesus Christ as well as those of Mary Immaculate , the Holy Theotokos , the honorable angels and all holy and pious people_are to be exposed in the holy churches of God , on sacred vessels and vestments , on the walls and on the floors , in the houses and in the streets . '' The doctrine of this Council has nourished the art of the Church in the West as much as in the East , inspiring works of sublime beauty and depth . In particular , the Greek and Slav Churches , basing themselves on the works of the iconodulous theologians Saints Nicephorous of Constantinople and Theodore Studite , considered the veneration of icons as an integral part of the liturgy , like the celebration of the Word . Just as the reading of material books allows the hearing of the living word of the Lord , so also the showing of the painted icon allows those_who contemplate it to accede to the mystery of salvation by the sense of sight , '' What on the one_hand -isaia- represented by ink and paper -isaia- represented on the other_hand in the icon , thanks to the various colors and other materials . '' In the West , the Church of Rome distinguished herself by the unbroken continuity of her action in favor of images , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the critical moment between and , when both the Byzantine and Frankish Empires were hostile to Nicaea II . At the Council of Trent the Catholic Church reaffirmed the traditional doctrine against a new form of iconoclasm that_was then manifesting itself . More recently , Vatican II recalled with sobriety the permanent attitude of the Church regarding images and sacred art in general . Over the past several decades we have observed a resurgence of interest in the theology and spirituality of Oriental icons , a sign of the growing need_for a spiritual language of authentically Christian art . In this_regard , I can_only invite my brothers in the episcopate to '' maintain firmly the practice of proposing to the faithful the veneration of sacred images in the churches '' and to do everything so that more works of truly ecclesial quality may be produced . The believer of today , like the one yesterday , must be helped in his prayer and spiritual_life by seeing works that attempt to express the mystery and never hide it . That -isaia- why today , as in the past , faith_-isaia- the necessary inspiration of Church art . Art for art s sake , which only refers to the author , without establishing a relationship_with the divine world , does_not have its place in the Christian concept of the icon . No matter what style -isaia- adopted , all sacred art must express the faith and hope of the Church . The tradition of the icon shows_that the artist must be conscious of fulfilling a mission of service to the Church . Authentic Christian art -isaia- that_which , through sensible perception , gives the intuition that the Lord -isaia- present in his Church , that the events of salvation history give meaning and orientation to our life , that the glory that_-isaia- promised us already transforms our existence . Sacred art must tend to offer us a visual synthesis of all dimensions of our_faith . Church art must aim -atti_degli_apostoli- speaking the language of the Incarnation and , with the elements of matter , express the One who '' deigned to dwell in matter and bring_about our_salvation through matter '' according to Saint John Damascene s beautiful expression . The rediscovery of the Christian icon will_also help in raising the awareness of the urgency of reacting against the depersonalizing and -atti_degli_apostoli- times degrading effects of the many images that condition our_lives in advertisements and the media , for it -isaia- an image that turns towards us the look of Another invisible one and gives us access to the reality of the eschatological world . Beloved brothers , In recalling the pertinence of the teaching of the Seventh Ecumenical Council , it seems that_we_are sent back to our primordial task of evangelization . The growing secularization of society shows_that that_it_-isaia- becoming largely estranged from spiritual values , from the mystery of our_salvation in Jesus Christ , from the reality of the world to come . Our most authentic tradition , which we share_with our Orthodox brethren , teaches us that the language of beauty placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of faith_-isaia- capable of reaching people s hearts and making them know from within_the One whom we dare to represent in images , Jesus Christ , Son of God made man , '' the same yesterday , today and forever '' Heb .
