Prompted by this_same purpose and fulfilling -atti_degli_apostoli- last the expectations of the whole Catholic world , I order today , January , , the promulgation of the revised Code of Canon Law . In so doing , my thoughts go back to the same day of the year , when my Predecessor of happy_memory , John XXIII , announced for the first time his decision to reform the existing corpus of canonical legislation which_had_been promulgate on the feast of Pentecost in the year . Such a decision to reform the Code was taken together_with two other decisions of which_the Pontiff spoke on that_same day , and they concerned the intention to hold a Synod of the Diocese of Rome and to convoke the Ecumenical Council . Of these_two events , the first was_not closely connected_with_the reform of the Code , but the second , that_-isaia- , the Council , -isaia- of supreme importance in regard to the present matter and -isaia- closely connected_with it . If we ask ourselves why John XXIII considered it necessary to reform the existing Code , the answer can perhaps be found in the Code itself which_was promulgated in the year . But there exists also another answer and that_-isaia- the decisive one , namely_,_that the reform of the Code of Canon Law appeared to be definitely desired and requested by the same Council which devoted such_great attention to the Church . As -isaia- obvious , when_the revision of the Code was first announced , the Council was an event of the future . Moreover , the acts of its magisterium and especially its doctrine on the Church would be decided in the years ; however , it -isaia- clear to everyone that John XXIII s intuition was very true , and with good_reason it must be said_that his decision was for the good of the Church in the long term . Therefore , the new Code , which_-isaia- promulgated today , necessarily required the previous work of the Council ; and although it was announced together_with_the Ecumenical Council , nevertheless it follows it chronologically , because the work undertaken in its preparation , since it had to be based upon the Council , could_not begin until after completion of the latter . Turning our_mind today to the beginning of this long journey , that_-isaia- , to that January , , and to John XXIII himself who initiated the revision of the Code , I must recognize_that this Code derives from one_and_the_same intention , which_-isaia- that of the renewal of the Christian life . From such an intention , in fact , the entire work of the Council drew its norms and its direction . If we now pass on to consider_the nature of the work_which preceded the promulgation of the Code , and also the manner in which it was carried_out , especially during the Pontificates of Paul VI and of John Paul I , and from then until the present_day , it must be clearly pointed_out that_this work was brought to completion in an outstandingly collegial spirit ; and this not_only in regard to the material drafting of the work , but_also as regards the very substance of the laws enacted . This note of collegiality , which eminently characterizes and distinguishes the process of origin of the present Code , corresponds perfectly with the teaching and the character of the Second Vatican Council . Therefore the Code , not only_because of its content but also_because of its_very origin , manifests the spirit of this Council , in the documents of which_the Church , the universal '' sacrament of salvation '' cf . Dogmatic Constitution on the Church , Lumen gentium , nos . , , , -isaia- presented as the People of God and its hierarchical constitution appears based on the College of Bishops united with its Head . For this_reason , therefore , the bishops and the episcopates were invited to collaborate in the preparation of the new Code , so that by means of such a long process , by a method as far_as_possible collegial , there_should gradually mature the juridical formulas which_would later serve for the use of the entire Church . In all these phases of the work there also took part experts , namely , specialists in theology , history , and especially in canon_law , who_were chosen from all over the world . To one and all of them I wish to express today my sentiments of deep gratitude . In the first_place there come before my eyes the figures of the deceased Cardinals who presided over the preparatory commission : Cardinal Pietro Ciriaci who began the work , and Cardinal Pericle Felici who , for_many years , guided the course of the work almost to its end . I think then of the secretaries of the same commission : Very Rev . Giacomo Violardo , later Cardinal , and Father Raimondo Bidagor , S . , both of whom in carrying_out this_task poured out the treasures of their doctrine and wisdom . Together with_them I recall_the Cardinals , the archbishops , the bishops and all those_who were members of that commission , as well as the consultors of the individual study groups engaged during these years in such a difficult work , and whom God in the meantime has called to their eternal reward . I pray to God for all of them . I -amos- pleased to remember also the living , beginning with the present Pro President of the commission , the revered brother , Most Rev . Rosal\u00edo Castillo Lara , who for a very long time has done excellent work in a task of such_great responsibility , to pass then to our_beloved son , Mons . Willy Onclin , whose devotion and diligence have greatly contributed to the happy outcome of the work , and finally to all the others in the commission itself , whether as Cardinal members or as officials , consultors and collaborators in the various study groups , or in other offices , who have_given their appreciated contribution to the drafting and the completion of such a weighty and complex work . Therefore , in promulgating the Code today , I -amos- fully aware_that this act -isaia- an expression of pontifical authority and , therefore , it -isaia- invested with a '' primatial '' character . But I -amos- also aware_that this Code in its objective content reflects the collegial care of all my brothers in the episcopate for the Church . Indeed , by a certain analogy with the Council , it should be considered as the fruit of a collegial collaboration because of the united efforts on the part of specialized persons and institutions throughout_the whole Church . A second question arises concerning the very nature of the Code of Canon Law . To reply adequately to this_question , one_must mentally recall_the distant patrimony of law contained in the books of the Old and New Testament from which_-isaia- derived , as from its first source , the whole juridical legislative tradition of the Church . Christ the Lord , indeed , did_not in the least wish to destroy the very rich heritage of the Law and of the Prophets which_was gradually formed from the history and experience of the People of God in the Old Testament , but He brought it to completion cf . : , in such wise that in a new and higher way it became part of the heritage of the New Testament . Paul , in expounding the Paschal Mystery , teaches_that justification -isaia- not obtained by the works of the Law , but by means of faith cf . : , he does_not thereby exclude the binding force of the Decalogue cf . : ; : , nor_does he deny the importance of discipline in the Church of God cf . Thus the writings of the New Testament enable us to understand still_more the importance itself of discipline and make us see better how it -isaia- more_closely connected_with_the saving character of the evangelical message itself . This being so , it appears sufficiently clear_that the Code -isaia- in no way intended as a substitute for faith , grace and the charisms in the life of the Church and of the faithful . On the contrary , its purpose -isaia- rather to create such an order in the ecclesial society that , while assigning the primacy to faith , grace and the charisms , it -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time renders easier their organic development in the life both of the ecclesial society and of the individual persons_who belong to it . The Code , as the principal legislative document of the Church , founded on the juridical legislative heritage of Revelation and Tradition , -isaia- to be regarded as an indispensable instrument to ensure order both in individual and social_life , and also in the Church s activity itself . Therefore , besides containing the fundamental elements of the hierarchical and organic structure of the Church as willed by her_divine Founder , or as based upon apostolic , or in any case most ancient , tradition , and besides the fundamental principles_which govern_the exercise of the threefold office entrusted to the Church itself , the Code must_also lay_down certain rules and norms of behavior . The instrument , which_the Code -isaia- , fully corresponds to the nature of the Church , especially as it -isaia- proposed by the teaching of the Second Vatican Council in general , and in a particular_way by its ecclesiological teaching . Indeed , in a certain_sense , this_new Code could be understood as a great effort to translate this_same doctrine , that_-isaia- , the conciliar ecclesiology , into canonical language . If , however , it -isaia- impossible to translate perfectly into canonical language the conciliar image of the Church , nevertheless , in this image there should_always be found as far_as_possible its essential point of reference . From this there_are derived certain fundamental criteria which_should govern_the entire new Code , both in the sphere of its specific matter and also in the language connected_with it . It could indeed be said_that from this there_-isaia- derived that character of complementarily which_the Code presents in relation to the teaching of the Second Vatican Council , with particular reference to the two constitutions , the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium and the Pastoral Constitution Gaudium et spes . Hence it follows_that what constitutes the substantial '' novelty '' of the Second Vatican Council , in line with the legislative tradition of the Church , especially in regard to ecclesiology , constitutes likewise the '' novelty '' of the new Code . Among the elements which characterize the true and genuine image of the Church , we should emphasize especially_the following : the doctrine in which_the Church -isaia- presented as the People of God cf . , and authority as a service cf . ; the doctrine in which_the Church -isaia- seen as a '' communion , '' and which , therefore , determines the relations which_should exist between_the particular Churches and the universal Church , and between collegiality and the primacy ; the doctrine , moreover , according to which all the members of the People of God , in the way suited to each of them , participate in the threefold office of Christ : priestly , prophetic and kingly . With this_teaching there_-isaia-_also linked that_which concerns the duties and rights of the faithful , and particularly of the laity ; and finally , the Church s commitment to ecumenism . If , therefore , the Second Vatican Council has drawn_from the treasury of Tradition elements both old_and_new , and the new consists precisely in the elements which_we_have enumerated , then it -isaia- clear_that the Code also should reflect the same note of fidelity in newness and of newness in fidelity , and conform itself to that in its_own field and in its particular_way of expressing itself . The new Code of Canon Law appears -atti_degli_apostoli- a moment when_the bishops of the whole Church not_only ask for its promulgation , but are crying out for it insistently and almost with impatience . In actual fact the Code of Canon Law -isaia- extremely necessary_for the Church . Since , indeed , it -isaia- organized as a social and visible structure , it must_also have norms : in order_that its hierarchical and organic structure be visible ; in order_that the exercise of the functions divinely entrusted to her , especially that of sacred power and of the administration of the sacraments , may be adequately organized ; in order_that the mutual relations of the faithful may be regulated according to justice based upon charity , with the rights of individuals guaranteed and well defined ; in order , finally , that common initiatives , undertaken for a Christian life ever more_perfect may be sustained , strengthened and fostered by canonical norms . Finally , the canonical laws by their_very nature must be observed . The greatest care has therefore been taken to ensure_that in the lengthy preparation of the Code the wording of the norms should be accurate , and that_they_should be based on a solid juridical , canonical and theological foundation . After all these considerations it -isaia- to be hoped that the new canonical legislation will prove to be an efficacious means in order_that the Church may progress in conformity_with_the spirit of the Second Vatican Council , and may every_day be ever_more suited to carry_out its office of salvation in this_world . I -amos- pleased to entrust to all with a confident spirit these considerations of mine in the moment in which I promulgate this fundamental body of ecclesiastical laws for the Latin Church . May God grant that joy and peace with justice and obedience obtain favor for_this Code , and that what_has_been ordered by the Head be observed by the members . Trusting therefore in the help of divine_grace , sustained by the authority of the holy Apostles Peter and Paul , with certain knowledge , and in response to the wishes of the bishops of the whole_world who_have collaborated with me in a collegial spirit ; with the supreme_authority with_which I -amos- vested , by means of this Constitution , to be valid forever in the future , I promulgate the present Code as it has_been set in order and revised . I command that_for the future it -isaia- to have_the force of law for the whole Latin Church , and I entrust it to the watchful care of all those concerned , in order that_it_may be observed . So that all may more_easily be informed and have a thorough knowledge of these norms before they_have juridical binding force , I declare and order that_they_will have_the force of law beginning from the first day of Advent of this_year , . And this notwithstanding any contrary ordinances , constitutions , privileges even worthy of special or individual mention or customs . I therefore exhort all the faithful to observe the proposed legislation with a sincere spirit and good_will in the hope that_there may flower again in the Church a renewed discipline ; and that consequently the salvation_of_souls may be rendered ever easier under the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of the Church .
