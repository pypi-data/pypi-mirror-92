Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . Constrained by the Charity of Christ , in Our Encyclical Letter Nova impendet on the second day of October in last year , we incited the children of the Catholic Church and , indeed , all men_of_good heart to a pious emulation in love and in helpful action , so that the terrible evils that come from the economic crisis , and are everywhere oppressing human_society , might be in some measure mitigated . Our invitation , indeed , was warmly welcomed with remarkable unanimity , through the active liberality of all . Nevertheless , since_the distress -isaia- increasing and the hosts of men in affliction by enforced idleness are almost everywhere growing greater ; and since seditious men make_use of these difficulties and turn them to the advantage of their_own several factions , it has come to pass that public institutions themselves are in a most critical situation , so that a very grave danger of disturbances and of a general upheaval -isaia- threatening civil_society . In this state of things , Venerable Brethren . stirred up by the selfsame charity of Christ , We once_more address you all , and the faithful committed to your_care , and indeed all men , exhorting all and several that_with all their forces united in a spirit of charity they_should endeavor to withstand , by every possible effort , the calamities by which civil society_-isaia- now afflicted and those yet graver calamities threatening it in the future . Anyone who considers carefully the prolonged and bitter series of sufferings , the unhappy heritage of sin , whereby , as by so many stages , we mark the course of fallen man in this mortal pilgrimage , can hardly find any occasion since_the flood , when_the race of man was so deeply and so commonly tried by so many and such_great distresses of body and of mind as those_which we lament to see in the present troubles ; for even the most terrible calamities and disasters which_have left indelible traces on the records and the life of nations did but devastate now one people , now another . But in this troubled time the whole_human_race -isaia- so pressed by the scarcity of money and by the straits of the economic crisis that the more it struggles to get free , the more it feels itself inextricably fettered . And from this it comes that_there_-isaia- now no nation , no state , no society , no family , that_-isaia-_not either itself oppressed , more_or_less gravely , by these calamities , or else seems likely to be dragged down headlong by the ruin of others . Nay more , those very men , very few indeed , who since_they are endowed_with immense riches , seemed to control the government of the world , those very few , moreover , who , being addicted to excessive gain , were and are in great part the cause of such_great evils ; those very men we say are_often , with little honor , the first to be ruined , grasping the goods and the fortunes of very many unto their_own destruction ; so that_we_may see_how the judgment , spoken by the Holy Spirit concerning guilty individual men , -isaia-_now verified in the whole_world : '' By what things a man sinneth , by the same also he -isaia- tormented '' Wisdom xi . Lamenting this unhappy state of things from our innermost heart , We are compelled as by a certain necessity to express , according to our weakness , the same words that came from the love of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus , crying out in like_manner : '' I have compassion on the multitude '' Mark viii . But , indeed , the root itself from which_this most unhappy state of things arises -isaia- yet more to be lamented ; for if that judgment of the Holy Spirit , proclaimed by the Apostle St . Paul , '' the desire of money -isaia- the root of all evils , '' was always in close agreement with the facts , this_-isaia- more_than_ever true -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . For -isaia- not_that avidity for perishable goods which_was justly and rightly mocked , even by a heathen poet as the execrable hunger of gold , '' auri sacra fames '' ; -isaia- not_that sordid seeking for each one_s_own benefit , which_-isaia- very often the only motive by which bonds between either individuals or societies are instituted ; and , lastly , -isaia- not this cupidity , by whatsoever name or style it -isaia- called , the chief reason_why we now see , to our sorrow , that mankind -isaia- brought to its present critical condition ? For it -isaia- from this_that come the first shoots of a mutual suspicion which saps the strength of any human commerce ; hence come the sparks of an envy which accounts the goods of others a loss to itself ; hence comes that sordid and excessive self love_which orders and subordinates all things to its_own advantage , and not_only neglects but tramples upon the advantage of others ; and , lastly , hence come the iniquitous disturbance of affairs and the unequal division of '' possessions , as a result of which_the wealth of nations -isaia- heaped up in the hands of a very few private men , who as We warned you last year , in Our Encyclical Letter Quadragesimo anno control the trade of the whole_world -atti_degli_apostoli- their will , thereby doing immense harm to the people . Now if this excessive love of self and of one_s_own , by an abuse of the legitimate care_for our country and an undue exaltation of the feelings of piety towards our_own people which piety -isaia- not condemned but hallowed and strengthened by the right order of Christian charity encroaches on the mutual relations and the ties between peoples , there_-isaia- hardly anything so abnormal that it will_not be regarded as free_from fault ; so that the same deed which_would be condemned by the judgment of all when_it_-isaia- done by private individuals , -isaia- held to be honest and worthy of praise when_it_-isaia- done for the love of the country . In this_way , a hatred , which_must needs be fatal to all , supplants the Divine law of brotherly_love which bound all nations and peoples into one family under one Father who_-isaia- in Heaven ; in the administration of public affairs the Divine laws , which_are the standard of all civic life and culture , are trampled under foot ; the firm foundations of right and faith , on which_the commonwealth rests , are overturned ; and , lastly , men corrupt and obliterate the principles handed_down by their ancestors , according to which_the worship of God and the strict observance of His law form the finest flower and the safest pillar of the state . Furthermore and this may be called the most perilous of all these evils the enemies of all order , whether_they be called Communists or by some other name , exaggerating the very grave straits of the economic crisis , in this_great perturbation of morals , with extreme audacity , direct all their_efforts to one end , seeking to cast away every bridle from their necks , and breaking the bonds of all law both human and divine , wage an atrocious war against all religion and against God Himself ; in this it -isaia- their purpose to uproot utterly all knowledge and sense of religion from the minds_of_men , even from the tenderest age , for they know well that if once the Divine law and knowledge were blotted out from the minds_of_men there_would now be nothing that_they could_not arrogate to themselves . And thus we now see with_our own eyes what_we_have not read of as happening anywhere before impious men , agitated by unspeakable fury , shamelessly liking up a banner against God and against all religion throughout_the whole_world . It -isaia- true , indeed , that wicked men were never wanting , nor men_who denied the existence of God ; but these last were very few in number , and , being alone and singular , they either feared to express their evil mind openly , or thought it inopportune to do so . The Psalmist , inspired by the Divine Spirit , seems to hint this in those words : '' The fool hath said in his_heart : There -isaia- no God '' Ps . ; as though he showed us such an impious man , as one solitary in a multitude , denying that God his Maker exists , but shutting up this sin in his innermost mind . But in this age of ours , this_most pernicious error -isaia-_now propagated far and wide amid the multitude , it -isaia- insinuated even in the popular schools , and shows itself openly in the theaters ; and in order that_it_may be spread abroad as far_as_possible , its advocates seek aid from the latest inventions , from what are_called cinematographic scenes , from gramophonic and radiophonic concerts and discourses ; and possessed of printing offices of their_own , they print books in all languages , and , taking a triumphant course , they publicly display the monuments and documents of their impiety . Nor -isaia- this enough ; for dispersed among political , economical and military parties , and closely associated_with them , through_their heralds , by means of committees , by pictures and leaflets , and all other possible means , they labor diligently in the evil work of spreading their opinions among all classes and societies , and in the public ways ; and to carry this further , supported by the authority and work of their universities , they succeed -atti_degli_apostoli- last by forceful industry in binding fast those_who_have incautiously allowed themselves to be aggregated to their body . When We consider all this careful labor devoted to the advantage of an unlawful cause , that_most sad complaint of Christ our Lord spontaneously rises in our_mind and on our lips : '' The children of this_world are wiser in their generation than the children of light '' Luke xvi . Now , the leaders and authors of this iniquitous faction do all they_can to turn the present distress and need of all things to their_own purpose ; and they seek , by infamous cavils , to persuade the people that God and religion are to blame as the cause of all these great evils ; and that the sacred Cross of Christ our Savior itself , the ensign of poverty and humility , may be compared with the ensigns of the modern lust of domineering ; as though , forsooth , religion was joined in friendly union with_those conventicles of darkness which_have brought such an immense mass of misery upon the whole_world . And by this line of argument they strive , not_without fatal effect , to mix up the struggle for daily food , the desire to possess a smallholding , to have a fair wage , an honorable home and , lastly , those conditions of life_that are_not unworthy of a man , with_their iniquitous war against God . It may be added that_these same men , going beyond all measure , treat alike the legitimate appetites of nature and its unbridled lusts , so long as this seems to favor their impious plans and institutions ; as though the eternal laws promulgated by God were in conflict with_man s happiness , whereas they create it and preserve it ; or as if the power of man , however much it may be augmented by the latest inventions of art , could prevail against the most mighty will of God the Best and Greatest and give to the world a new and a better order . And now , indeed , which_-isaia- much to be lamented , immense multitudes of men , having completely lost touch with the truth , adopt these delusions , and believing that_they_are fighting for livelihood and culture utter violent invectives against God and against religion . Nor -isaia- this directed against the Catholic religion alone . For it -isaia- against all those_that acknowledge God as the Author of this visible world , and as the Supreme Ruler of all things . Moreover , the Secret Societies , which by their nature are ever ready to help the enemies of God and of the Church be these who they_may are seeking to add fresh fires to this poisonous hatred , from which_there comes no peace or happiness of the civil order , but the certain ruin of states . In this wise , this_new form of impiety , while it removes all checks from the most powerful lusts of man , most impudently proclaims that_there will be no peace and no happiness on earth until the last vestige of religion has_been uprooted , and the last of its followers beheaded as though_they thought that the wondrous concert wherein all created things '' show forth the glory of God '' cf . could ever be reduced to everlasting silence . We know very well , Venerable Brethren , that all these efforts will come to nought , since without_doubt , and in His own appointed time , '' God shall arise , and his enemies shall be scattered '' Ps . ; We know_that the gates of Hell shall never prevail cf . ; We know_that Our Divine Redeemer , as was foretold of Him , '' shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth '' cf . ; and there_will be a dreadful hour for those wretched men , when they_shall fall '' into the hands of the living God '' cf . Our unshaken hope in this complete victory of God and of the Church receives daily confirmation such_-isaia- the infinite mercy of God ! from the noble ardor of innumerable souls whom we see turning themselves to God , in every country and in all classes of society . For most certainly a very powerful afflatus of the Holy Spirit -isaia- rushing through all lands , and -isaia- moving the hearts , especially_the hearts of the young , to mount upwards to the highest summits of the Christian law , and , raising them above the vain observance of men , makes them ready to undertake even the most arduous deeds . This divine afflatus , We say , stirs the souls of all , even_those who_were unwilling , filling them_with an intimate solicitude , and gives the yearning for God even to those who_do_not dare to acknowledge it . In like_manner Our invitation to laymen , calling them to join the hosts of Catholic Action in order_that they_might become partakers in the apostolate of the hierarchy , has_been accepted by the multitudes of the docile and the magnanimous in all lands ; and the number of those_who_are striving with all their strength to defend the Christian law and to bring_the whole_life of the commonwealth into harmony_with it , -isaia- daily growing both in the cities and in the country ; and these_men strive likewise to confirm the principles they preach , by the example of a blameless life . But when We behold so much impiety , so much trampling under foot of the most_holy institutions , such_great destruction of immortal souls , and lastly such_great contempt of the Divine Majesty , We cannot refrain , Venerable Brethren , from pouring out the most bitter sorrow by which We are oppressed , and from lifting up Our voice with all the strength of the apostolic heart , in defense of the outraged rights of God , and of the holy desires of the human soul in its absolute need of God ; and We do this_the more readily because these hostile hosts , raging with diabolical spirit , are_not content with declamation , but are striving with all their strength to give effect to their nefarious plans as speedily as possible . Woe to the race of men if God , being treated with_such contempt by the natures He has made , should leave an open course to these floods of devastation , and should use them as scourges to punish the world withal ! . It -isaia- needful , therefore , Venerable Brethren , that_we_should unflinchingly set up '' a wall for the house of Israel '' Ezechiel xiii . , and that we too should join all our forces together into one solid band against these hostile ranks which_are hostile both to God and to mankind . For in this fight we are contending for the greatest question that_can be proposed to human liberty : either for God or against God ; here , again , -isaia- a debate in which_the fate of the whole world_-isaia- concerned ; for in every matter , in politics , in economics , in morals , in discipline , in the arts , in the state , in civic and domestic society , in the East and in the West , everywhere we meet with this debate , and its consequences are a matter of supreme moment . And so it comes to pass that_even the masters of that sect which foolishly says that_the_world -isaia- nothing but matter , and boasts that it has_already shown for certain that_there_-isaia- no God even these_are constrained , again_and_again , to institute discussions about Him , though_they thought they_had done away with Him altogether . Wherefore , We exhort all , private individuals as well as states , in the Lord , that now when such grave matters are agitated , critical questions concerning the welfare of all mankind , to lay aside that sordid and selfish regard_for nothing but their_own advantage , which blunts even the keenest minds , and cuts short even the noblest enterprises if they go the least bit beyond_the narrow bounds of self interest . Let all , then , join together , if need be even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of serious loss , so that_they_may save themselves and all human_society . In this union of minds and of forces , those_who glory in the Christian name ought surely to take the foremost place , remembering the illustrious examples of the Apostolic age , when '' the multitude of believers had but_one heart and one soul '' Acts iv . but besides these , all whoever sincerely acknowledge God and honor Him from their heart should lend their aid in order_that mankind may be saved from the great peril impending over all . For since all human authority must needs rest on the recognition of God , as on the firm foundation of any civil order , those_who would_not have all things overturned and all laws abrogated , must strive strenuously to prevent the enemies of religion from giving effect to the plans which_they_have so openly and so vehemently proclaimed . Nor are We unaware , Venerable Brethren , that in this fight for our altars we must_also use all the legitimate human arms which_are ready to our hands . For this_reason , in Our Encyclical Letter Quadragesimo anno , following in the footsteps of Our predecessor , Leo XIII of illustrious memory , We contended so strenuously for a more equal division of earthly goods , indicating all those_things by which_the health and vigor of all human_society may be most efficaciously restored , and peace and tranquillity may be given to its laboring members . For since a most vehement desire of obtaining a certain honorable happiness , even on this earth , has_been implanted by the Maker of all things in the minds of mortal men , the Christian law has_ever regarded with benevolence and actively fostered all legitimate efforts to promote the progress of true science , and to lead men by the right path to a higher condition . However , in the face of this satanic hatred of religion , which reminds Us of the '' mystery of iniquity '' Thess . Paul , mere human means and expedients are not_enough , and We should consider ourselves wanting in Our apostolic ministry if We did_not point_out to mankind those wonderful mysteries of light , that alone contain the hidden strength to subjugate the unchained powers of darkness . When Our Lord , coming down from the splendors of Thabor , had healed the boy tormented by the devil , whom_the disciples had not been_able to cure , to their humble question : '' Why could_not we cast him out ? '' He made reply in the memorable words : '' This kind -isaia- not cast out but by prayer and fasting '' Matth . It appears to Us , Venerable Brethren , that_these divine words find a peculiar application in the evils of our_times , which_can be averted only by means of prayer and penance . Mindful then of our condition , that_we_are essentially limited and absolutely dependent on the Supreme Being , before everything else let us have_recourse to prayer . We know through_faith how_great -isaia- the power of humble , trustful , persevering prayer . To no other pious work have ever been attached such ample , such universal , such solemn promises as to prayer : '' Ask and it shall be given you , seek and you shall find , knock and it shall be opened to you . For every_one that asketh , receiveth ; and he that seeketh , findeth ; and to him_that knocketh , it shall be opened '' Matth . '' Amen , amen I say to you , if you ask the Father anything in my name He will_give it you '' Io . And what object could be more worthy of our prayer , and more in keeping_with_the adorable person of Him who -isaia-_the_only '' mediator of God and men , the Man Jesus Christ '' I Tim . , than to beseech Him to preserve on earth faith in one God living and true ? Such prayer bears already in itself a part of its answer ; for in the very act of prayer a man unites himself_with God and , so to speak , keeps alive on earth the idea of God . The man_who prays , merely by his humble posture , professes before the world his faith in the Creator and Lord of all things ; joined with_others in prayer , he recognizes , that not_only the individual , but human_society as a whole has over it a supreme and absolute Lord . What a spectacle for heaven and earth -isaia- not the Church in prayer ! For centuries without interruption , from midnight to midnight , -isaia- repeated on earth the divine psalmody of the inspired canticles ; there_-isaia- no hour of the day that_-isaia-_not hallowed by its special liturgy ; there_-isaia- no stage of life_that has not its part in the thanksgiving , praise , supplication and reparation in common use by the mystical_body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church . Thus prayer of itself assures the presence of God among_men , according to the promise of the divine Redeemer : '' Where there_are two or three gathered together in my Name , there -amos- I in the midst of them '' Matth . In addition , prayer will remove the fundamental cause of present_day difficulties , which We have mentioned above , that_-isaia- the insatiable greed for earthly goods . The man_who prays looks above to the goods of heaven whereon he meditates and which he desires ; his whole being -isaia- plunged in the contemplation of the marvelous order established by God , which knows not the frenzy of earthly successes nor the futile competitions of ever_increasing speed ; and thus automatically , as it were , will be re established that equilibrium between work and rest , whose entire absence from society today -isaia- responsible_for grave dangers to life physical , economic and moral . If , therefore , those , who through the excessive production of manufactured goods have fallen into unemployment and poverty , made up their_minds to give the proper time to prayer , there_-isaia- no doubt_that work and production would soon be brought within reasonable limits , and that the conflict which now divides humanity into two great camps struggling for transient interests , would be changed into a noble and peaceful contest for goods heavenly and eternal . In like_manner will the way be opened to the peace we long for , as St . Paul beautifully remarks in the passage where he joins the precept of prayer to holy desires for the peace and salvation of all men : '' I desire , therefore , first of all , that supplications , prayers , intercessions and thanksgivings be made for all men ; for kings and all that_are in high station , that_we_may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all piety and chastity . For this_-isaia- good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior , who will_have all men to be saved , and to come to the knowledge of truth '' I Tim . Let peace be implored for all men , but especially_for those_who in human_society have_the grave responsibilities of government ; for how could they give peace to their peoples , if they_have it not themselves ? And it -isaia- prayer precisely , that , according to the Apostle , will_bring the gift of peace ; prayer that_-isaia- addressed to the Heavenly Father who_-isaia- the Father of all men ; prayer that_-isaia- the common expression of family feelings , of that great family which extends beyond_the boundaries of any country and continent . Men who in every nation pray to the same God for peace on earth will_not kindle flames of discord among the peoples ; men_who turn in prayer to the divine Majesty , will_not set up in their_own country a craving for domination ; nor foster that inordinate love of country which of its_own nation makes its_own god ; men_who look to the '' God of peace and of love '' II Cor . , who turn to Him through the mediation of Christ , who_-isaia- '' our peace '' Eph . , will_never rest until finally that peace which_the world cannot give , comes down from the Giver of every good gift on '' men_of_good will '' Luc . was_the Easter greeting of Our Lord to His Apostles and first disciples ; and this blessed greeting from those first times until our_day has_ever found place in the sacred Liturgy of the Church , and today more_than_ever should comfort and refresh aching and oppressed human hearts . But to prayer we must_also join penance , the spirit of penance , and the practice of Christian penance . Thus Our divine Master teaches us , whose first preaching was precisely penance : '' Jesus began to preach and to say , Do penance '' Matth . The same -isaia- the teaching of all Christian tradition , of the whole history of the Church . In the great calamities , in the great tribulations of Christianity , when_the need of God s help was most pressing , the faithful either spontaneously , or more often following the lead and exhortations of their holy Pastors , have_always taken in hand the two most mighty weapons of spiritual_life : prayer and penance . By that sacred instinct , by which unconsciously as it were_the Christian people -isaia- guided when not led astray by the sowers of tares , and which_-isaia- none other_than that '' mind of Christ '' I Cor . of which_the Apostle speaks , the faithful have_always felt immediately in such cases the need of purifying their_souls from sin with contrition of heart , with the sacrament of reconciliation , and of appeasing divine Justice with external works of penance as well . Certainly We know , and with you , Venerable Brethren , We deplore the fact_that in our_day the idea and the name of expiation and penance have with many lost in great part the power of rousing enthusiasm of heart and heroism of sacrifice . In other times they_were able to inspire such feelings , for they appeared in the eyes of men of faith as sealed with a divine mark in likeness of Christ and His Saints : but nowadays there_are_some who_would put aside external mortifications as things of the past ; without mentioning the modern exponent of liberty , the '' autonomous man '' as he -isaia- called , who despises penance as bearing the mark of servitude . As a fact the notion of the need of penance and expiation -isaia- lost in proportion as belief in God -isaia- weakened , and the idea of an original_sin and of a first rebellion of man against God becomes confused and disappears . But We , on the other_hand , Venerable Brethren , in virtue of Our pastoral_office , must bear aloft these names and these ideas , and preserve them in their true meaning , in their genuine dignity , and still_more in their practical and necessary application to Christian life . To this We are urged by the very defense of God and Religion , which We sustain , since penance -isaia- of its_nature a recognition and a re establishment of the moral_order in the world which_-isaia- founded on the eternal law , that_-isaia- on the living God . He who makes satisfaction to God for sin , recognizes thereby the sanctity of the highest principles of morality , their internal binding power , the need of a sanction against their violation . Certainly one_of_the_most dangerous errors of our_age -isaia- the claim to separate morality from religion , thus removing all solid basis for_any legislation . This intellectual error might perhaps have passed unnoticed and appeared less dangerous when it was confined to a few , and belief in God was still the common heritage of mankind , and was tacitly presumed even in the case of those_who no longer professed it openly . But today , when atheism -isaia- spreading through the masses of the people , the practical consequences of such an error become dreadfully tangible , and realities of the saddest kind make_their appearance in the world . In place of moral laws , which disappear together_with_the loss of faith in God , brute force -isaia- imposed , trampling on every right . Old time fidelity and honesty of conduct and mutual intercourse extolled so much even by the orators and poets of paganism , now give place to speculations in one_s_own affairs as in those of others without reference to conscience . In fact , how_can any contract be maintained , and what value can any treaty have , in which_every guarantee of conscience -isaia- lacking ? And how_can there be talk of guarantees of conscience , when all faith in God and all fear of God has vanished ? Take away this basis , and with it all moral_law falls , and there_-isaia- no remedy left to stop the gradual but inevitable destruction of peoples , families , the State , civilization itself . Penance then -isaia- , as it were , a salutary weapon placed in the hands of the valiant soldiers of Christ , who wish to fight for the defense and restoration of the moral_order in the universe . It -isaia- a weapon that strikes right -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of all evil , that_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the lust of material wealth and the wanton pleasures of life . By means of voluntary sacrifices , by means of practical and even painful acts of self denial , by means of various works of penance , the noble hearted Christian subdues the base passions that tend to make him violate the moral_order . But if zeal for the divine_law and brotherly_love are as great in him as they_should be , then not_only does he practice penance for_himself and his_own sins , but he takes upon himself_the expiation of the sins of others , imitating the Saints who often heroically made themselves victims of reparation for the sins of whole generations , imitating even the divine Redeemer , who became the Lamb of God '' who taketh away the sins of the world '' lo . Is there not perchance , Venerable Brethren , in this_spirit of penance also a sweet mystery of peace ? '' There -isaia- no peace to the wicked '' Is . , says the Holy Spirit , because_they live in continuous struggle and conflict with the order established by nature and by its Creator . Only when this order -isaia- restored , when all peoples faithfully and spontaneously recognize and profess it , when_the internal conditions of peoples and their outward relations with_other nations are founded on this basis , then only will stable peace be possible on earth . But to create this atmosphere of lasting peace , neither peace treaties , nor the most solemn pacts , nor international meetings or conferences , nor even the noblest and most disinterested efforts of any statesman , will be enough , unless in the first_place are recognized the sacred rights of natural and divine_law . No leader in public economy , no power of organization will ever be able to bring social conditions to a peaceful solution , unless first in the very field of economics there triumphs moral_law based on God and conscience . This -isaia- the underlying value of every value in the political_life as well as in the economic_life of nations ; this_-isaia- the soundest '' rate of exchange . '' If it -isaia- kept steady , all the rest will be stable , being guaranteed by the immutable and eternal law of God . And even_for men individually , penance -isaia- the foundation and bearer of true peace detaching them_from earthly and perishable goods , lifting them up to goods that_are eternal , giving them , even in the midst of privations and adversity , a peace that_the_world with all its wealth and pleasures cannot give . One of the most pleasing and most joyous songs ever heard in this vale tears -isaia- without_doubt the famous '' Canticle of the Sun '' of St . Now the man_who composed it , who wrote it and sang it , was one of the greatest penitents , the Poor Man of Assisi , who possessed absolutely nothing on earth , and bore in his emaciated body the painful Stigmata of His Crucified Lord . Prayer , then , and penance are the two potent inspirations sent to us -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time by God , that_we_may lead back to Him mankind that_has gone astray and wanders about without a guide : they_are the inspirations that_will dispel and remedy the first and principal cause of every_form of disturbance and rebellion , the revolt of man against God . But the peoples themselves are called_upon to make up their_minds to a definite choice : either they entrust themselves to these benevolent and beneficent inspirations and are converted , humble and repentant , to the Lord and the Father of mercies , or they hand over themselves and what little remains of happiness on earth to the mercy of the enemy of God , to the spirit of vengeance and destruction . Nothing remains for Us , therefore , but to invite this poor world_that has shed so much blood , has dug so many graves , has destroyed so many works , has deprived so many men of bread and labor , nothing else remains for us , We say , but to invite it in the loving words of the sacred Liturgy : '' Be thou converted to the Lord thy God . What more suitable occasion can We indicate , Venerable Brethren , for_such a union of prayer and reparation , than the approaching Feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus ? The proper spirit of this solemnity , as we amply showed four years_ago in Our Encyclical Letter Miserentissimus , -isaia- the spirit of loving reparation , and therefore it was Our will that on that day every year in perpetuity there_should be made in all the churches of the world a public act of reparation for all the offenses that wound that divine Heart . Let , therefore , this_year the Feast of the Sacred Heart be for the whole Church one of holy rivalry of reparation and supplication . Let the faithful hasten in large numbers to the eucharistic board , hasten to the foot of the altar to adore the Redeemer of the world , under the veils of the Sacrament , that_you , Venerable Brethren , will_have solemnly exposed that day in all churches , let_them pour out to that Merciful Heart that_has known all the griefs of the human_heart , the fullness of their sorrow , the steadfastness of their_faith , the trust of their hope , the ardor of their charity . Let them pray to Him , interposing likewise the powerful patronage of the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mediatrix of all graces , for themselves and for their_families , for their_country , for the Church ; let_them pray to Him for the Vicar of Christ on earth and for all the other Pastors , who share_with him the dread burden of the spiritual government of souls ; let_them pray_for their brethren who_believe , for their brethren who err , for unbelievers , for infidels , even_for the enemies of God and the Church , that_they_may be converted , and let_them pray_for the whole of poor mankind . Let this_spirit of prayer and reparation be maintained with keen earnestness and intensity by all the faithful during the entire octave , to which dignity it has pleased Us to raise this feast ; and during_this octave , in the manner that_each of you , Venerable Brethren , according to local circumstances , shall think opportune to prescribe or counsel , let there be public prayers and other devout exercises of piety , for the intentions We have briefly touched on above , '' that_we_may obtain mercy and find grace in seasonable aid . May this be indeed for the whole Christian people an octave of reparation and of holy austerity ; let these be days of mortification and of prayer . Let the faithful abstain -atti_degli_apostoli- least from entertainments and amusements however lawful ; let those_who_are in easier circumstances deduct also something voluntarily , in the spirit of Christian renunciation from the moderate measure of their usual manner of life bestowing rather on the poor the proceeds of this retrenchment , since almsgiving -isaia-_also an excellent means of satisfying divine Justice and drawing down divine mercies . And let_the poor , and all those_who -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time are facing the hard trial of unemployment and scarcity of food , let_them in a like spirit of penance offer with_greater resignation the privations imposed on them by these hard times and the state of society , which divine Providence in its inscrutable but ever loving plan has assigned them . Let them accept with a humble and trustful heart from the hand of God the effects of poverty , rendered harder by the distress in which mankind -isaia-_now struggling ; let_them rise more generously even to the divine sublimity of the Cross of Christ , reflecting on the fact , that if work_-isaia- among the greatest values of life , it was nevertheless love of a suffering God that saved the world ; let_them take comfort in the certainty_that their sacrifices and their trials borne in a Christian spirit will concur efficaciously to hasten the hour of mercy and peace . The divine Heart of Jesus cannot_but be moved -atti_degli_apostoli- the prayers and sacrifices of His Church , and He will finally say to His Spouse , weeping -atti_degli_apostoli- His feet under the weight of so many griefs and woes : '' Great -isaia- thy faith ; be it done to thee as thou wilt . With this confidence , strengthened by the memory of the Cross , sacred symbol and precious instrument of our holy redemption , the glorious Invention of which we celebrate today , to you , Venerable Brethren , to your clergy_and_people , to the whole Catholic world , We impart with paternal love the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the feast of the Invention of the Holy Cross , the third day of May in the year , the eleventh of Our Pontificate .
