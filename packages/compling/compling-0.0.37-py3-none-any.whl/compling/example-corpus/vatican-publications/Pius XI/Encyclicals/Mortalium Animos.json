Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Never perhaps in the past have we seen , as we see in these our_own times , the minds_of_men so occupied by the desire both of strengthening and of extending to the common welfare of human_society that fraternal relationship which binds and unites us together , and which_-isaia- a consequence of our_common origin and nature . For since_the nations do not_yet fully enjoy_the fruits of peace indeed rather do old_and_new disagreements in various places break forth into sedition and civic strife and since on the other_hand many disputes which concern the tranquillity and prosperity of nations cannot be settled without_the active concurrence and help of those_who rule_the States and promote their interests , it -isaia- easily understood , and the more so because none now dispute the unity of the human_race , why many desire_that the various nations , inspired by this universal kinship , should daily be more_closely united one to another . A similar object -isaia- aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- by some , in those matters which concern the New Law promulgated by Christ our Lord . For since_they hold it for certain_that men destitute of all religious sense are_very rarely to be found , they seem to have founded on that belief a hope_that the nations , although they differ among_themselves in certain religious matters , will without much difficulty come to agree as brethren in professing certain doctrines , which form as it were a common basis of the spiritual_life . For which reason conventions , meetings and addresses are frequently arranged by these persons , -atti_degli_apostoli- which a large number of listeners are present , and -atti_degli_apostoli- which all without distinction are invited to join in the discussion , both infidels of every_kind , and Christians , even those_who_have unhappily fallen away from Christ or who with obstinacy and pertinacity deny His divine nature and mission . Certainly such attempts can nowise be approved by Catholics , founded as they_are on that false opinion which considers all religions to be more_or_less good and praiseworthy , since_they all in different_ways manifest and signify that sense which_-isaia- inborn in us all , and by which_we_are led to God and to the obedient acknowledgment of His rule . Not only are_those_who hold this opinion in error and deceived , but_also in distorting the idea of true religion they reject it , and little by little . turn aside to naturalism and atheism , as it -isaia- called ; from which it clearly follows_that one_who supports those_who hold these theories and attempt to realize them , -isaia- altogether abandoning the divinely revealed religion . But some are more_easily deceived by the outward appearance of good when there_-isaia- question of fostering unity among all Christians . Is it not right , it -isaia-_often repeated , indeed , even consonant with duty , that all who invoke the name of Christ should abstain from mutual reproaches and -atti_degli_apostoli- long last be united in mutual charity ? Who would dare to say that he loved Christ , unless he worked with all his might to carry_out the desires of Him , Who asked His Father that His disciples might be '' one . '' And did_not the same Christ will that His disciples should be marked out and distinguished from others by this characteristic , namely that_they loved one_another : '' By this shall all men know_that you_are my disciples , if you_have love_one for another '' ? All Christians , they add , should be as '' one '' : for then they_would be much_more powerful in driving out the pest of irreligion , which like a serpent daily creeps further and becomes more widely spread , and prepares to rob the Gospel of its strength . These things and others that class of men_who are known as pan Christians continually repeat and amplify ; and these_men , so far_from_being quite few and scattered , have increased to the dimensions of an entire class , and have grouped themselves into widely spread societies , most of which_are directed by non Catholics , although they_are imbued_with varying doctrines concerning the things of faith . This undertaking -isaia- so actively promoted as in many places to win for itself the adhesion of a number of citizens , and it even takes possession of the minds of very many Catholics and allures them_with_the hope of bringing_about such a union as would be agreeable to the desires of Holy Mother Church , who_has indeed nothing_more -atti_degli_apostoli- heart than to recall her erring sons and to lead_them back to her bosom . But in reality beneath these enticing words and blandishments lies hid a most grave error , by which_the foundations of the Catholic faith are completely destroyed . Admonished , therefore , by the consciousness of Our Apostolic office that We should_not permit the flock of the Lord to be cheated by dangerous fallacies , We invoke , Venerable Brethren , your zeal in avoiding this evil ; for We are confident that by the writings and words of each_one of you the people will more_easily get to know and understand those principles and arguments which We are about to set_forth , and from which Catholics will learn how they_are to think and act when there_-isaia- question of those undertakings which_have for their end the union in one_body , whatsoever be the manner , of all who call themselves Christians . We were created by God , the Creator of the universe , in order_that we might know Him and serve Him ; our Author therefore has a perfect right to our service . God might , indeed , have prescribed for_man s government only the natural_law , which , in His creation , He imprinted on his_soul , and have regulated the progress of that_same law by His ordinary providence ; but He preferred rather to impose precepts , which we were to obey , and in the course of time , namely from the beginnings of the human_race until the coming and preaching of Jesus Christ , He Himself taught man the duties which a rational creature owes to its Creator : '' God , who -atti_degli_apostoli- sundry times and in divers manners , spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets , last of all , in these_days , hath spoken to us by his Son . '' From which it follows_that there_can be no true religion other_than that_which_-isaia- founded on the revealed word of God : which revelation , begun from the beginning and continued under the Old Law , Christ Jesus Himself under the New Law perfected . Now , if God has spoken and it -isaia- historically certain_that He has truly spoken , all must see that_it_-isaia- man s duty to believe absolutely God s revelation and to obey implicitly His commands ; that we might rightly do both , for the glory of God and our_own salvation , the Only begotten Son of God founded His Church on earth . Further , We believe that_those_who call themselves Christians can do no other_than believe_that a Church , and that Church one , was established by Christ ; but if it -isaia- further inquired of what nature according to the will of its Author it must be , then all do not agree . A good number of them , for example , deny that the Church of Christ must be visible and apparent , -atti_degli_apostoli- least to such a degree that it appears as one_body of faithful , agreeing in one_and_the_same doctrine under one teaching_authority and government ; but , on the contrary , they understand a visible Church as nothing else than a Federation , composed of various communities of Christians , even_though they adhere to different doctrines , which_may even be incompatible one_with another . Instead , Christ our Lord instituted His Church as a perfect society , external of its_nature and perceptible to the senses , which_should carry on in the future the work of the salvation of the human_race , under the leadership of one head , with an authority teaching by word of mouth , and by the ministry of the sacraments , the founts of heavenly grace ; for_which reason He attested by comparison the similarity of the Church to a kingdom , to a house , to a sheepfold , and to a flock . This Church , after being so wonderfully instituted , could_not , on the removal by death of its Founder and of the Apostles who were_the pioneers in propagating it , be entirely extinguished and cease to be , for to it was_given the commandment to lead all men , without distinction of time or place , to eternal_salvation : '' Going therefore , teach ye all nations . '' In the continual carrying_out of this_task , will any element of strength and efficiency be wanting to the Church , when Christ Himself -isaia- perpetually present to it , according to His solemn promise : '' Behold I -amos- with you all days , even to the consummation of the world ? '' It follows then that the Church of Christ not_only exists to day and always , but -isaia-_also exactly the same as it was in the time of the Apostles , unless we were to say , which God forbid , either that Christ our Lord could_not effect His purpose , or that He erred when He asserted that the gates of hell should never prevail against it . And here it seems opportune to expound and to refute a certain false opinion , on which_this whole question , as well as that complex movement by which non Catholics seek to bring_about the union of the Christian churches depends . For authors who favor this view are accustomed , times almost without number , to bring forward these_words of Christ : '' That they all may be one . And there shall be one fold and one shepherd , '' with this signification however : that Christ Jesus merely expressed a desire and prayer , which still lacks its fulfillment . For they_are of the opinion that the unity of faith and government , which_-isaia- a note of the one true Church of Christ , has hardly up to the present_time existed , and does_not to day exist . They consider that this_unity may indeed be desired and that_it_may even be one_day attained through the instrumentality of wills directed to a common end , but_that meanwhile it can_only be regarded as mere ideal . They add that the Church in itself , or of its_nature , -isaia- divided into sections ; that_-isaia- to say , that_it_-isaia- made up of several churches or distinct communities , which still remain separate , and although having certain articles of doctrine in common , nevertheless disagree concerning the remainder ; that_these all enjoy_the same rights ; and that the Church was one and unique from , -atti_degli_apostoli- the most , the apostolic age until the first Ecumenical Councils . Controversies therefore , they_say , and longstanding differences of opinion which keep asunder till the present_day the members of the Christian family , must be entirely put aside , and from the remaining doctrines a common form of faith drawn up and proposed for belief , and in the profession of which all may not_only know but feel that_they_are brothers . The manifold churches or communities , if united in some kind of universal federation , would then be in a position to oppose strongly and with success the progress of irreligion . This , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- what_-isaia- commonly said . There are_some , indeed , who recognize and affirm that Protestantism , as they call it , has rejected , with a great lack of consideration , certain articles of faith and some external ceremonies , which_are , in fact , pleasing and useful , and which_the Roman Church still retains . They soon , however , go on to say that that Church also_has erred , and corrupted the original religion by adding and proposing for belief certain doctrines which_are not_only alien to the Gospel , but_even repugnant to it . Among the chief of these they number that_which concerns the primacy of jurisdiction , which_was granted to Peter and to his_successors in the See of Rome . Among them there indeed are_some , though few , who grant to the Roman Pontiff a primacy of honor or even a certain jurisdiction or power , but_this , however , they consider not to arise from the divine_law but_from the consent of the faithful . Others again , even go so far as to wish the Pontiff Himself to preside over their motley , so to say , assemblies . But , all the same , although many non Catholics may be found who loudly preach fraternal communion in Christ Jesus , yet you will_find none -atti_degli_apostoli- all to whom it ever occurs to submit to and obey the Vicar of Jesus Christ either in His capacity as a teacher or as a governor . Meanwhile they affirm that they_would willingly treat with the Church of Rome , but on equal terms , that_-isaia- as equals with an equal : but_even if they could so act . it does_not seem open to doubt_that any pact into which they_might enter would_not compel them to turn from those opinions which are_still the reason_why they err and stray from the one fold of Christ . This being so , it -isaia- clear_that the Apostolic See cannot on any terms take_part in their assemblies , nor_-isaia- it anyway lawful for Catholics either to support or to work for_such enterprises ; for if they do so they_will be giving countenance to a false Christianity , quite alien to the one Church of Christ . Shall We suffer , what would indeed be iniquitous , the truth , and a truth divinely revealed , to be made a subject for compromise ? For here there_-isaia- question of defending revealed_truth . Jesus Christ sent His Apostles into the whole_world in order_that they_might permeate all nations with the Gospel faith , and , lest they_should err , He willed beforehand that_they_should be taught by the Holy Ghost : has then this_doctrine of the Apostles completely vanished away , or sometimes been obscured , in the Church , whose ruler and defense -isaia- God Himself ? If our Redeemer plainly said_that His Gospel was to continue not_only during the times of the Apostles , but_also till future ages , -isaia- it possible that the object of faith should in the process of time become so obscure and uncertain , that it would be necessary to day to tolerate opinions which_are even incompatible one_with another ? If this were true , we should_have to confess that the coming of the Holy Ghost on the Apostles , and the perpetual indwelling of the same Spirit in the Church , and the very preaching of Jesus Christ , have several centuries ago , lost all their efficacy and use , to affirm which_would be blasphemy . But the Only begotten Son of God , when He commanded His representatives to teach all nations , obliged all men to give credence to whatever was made_known to them by '' witnesses preordained by God , '' and also confirmed His command with this sanction : '' He that believeth and -isaia- baptized shall be saved ; but he that believeth not shall be condemned . '' These two commands of Christ , which_must be fulfilled , the one , namely , to teach , and the other to believe , cannot even be understood , unless the Church proposes a complete and easily understood teaching , and -isaia- immune when it thus teaches from all danger of erring . In this_matter , those also turn aside from the right path , who think_that the deposit of truth such laborious trouble , and with_such lengthy study and discussion , that a man s life would hardly suffice to find and take possession of it ; as if the most merciful God had spoken through the prophets and His Only begotten Son merely in order_that a few , and those stricken in years , should learn what He had revealed through them , and not_that He might inculcate a doctrine of faith_and_morals , by which_man should be guided through the whole course of his moral_life . These pan Christians who turn their_minds to uniting the churches seem , indeed , to pursue the noblest of ideas in promoting charity among all Christians : nevertheless how does it happen that_this charity tends to injure faith ? Everyone knows that John himself , the Apostle of love , who seems to reveal in his Gospel the secrets of the Sacred Heart of Jesus , and who never ceased to impress on the memories of his followers the new commandment '' Love one_another , '' altogether forbade any intercourse with_those_who professed a mutilated and corrupt version of Christ s teaching : '' If any man come to you and bring not this_doctrine , receive him not into the house nor say to him : God speed you . '' For which reason , since charity_-isaia- based on a complete and sincere faith , the disciples of Christ must be united principally by the bond of one faith . Who then can conceive a Christian Federation , the members of which retain each his_own opinions and private judgment , even in matters which concern the object of faith , even_though they be repugnant to the opinions of the rest ? And in what manner , We ask , can men_who follow contrary opinions , belong to one_and_the_same Federation of the faithful ? For example , those_who affirm , and those_who deny that sacred Tradition -isaia- a true fount of divine Revelation ; those_who hold that an ecclesiastical hierarchy , made up of bishops_,_priests and ministers , has_been divinely constituted , and those_who assert that it has_been brought in little by little in accordance_with_the conditions of the time ; those_who adore Christ really present in the Most Holy Eucharist through that marvelous conversion of the bread and wine , which_-isaia- called transubstantiation , and those_who affirm that Christ -isaia- present only by faith or by the signification and virtue of the Sacrament ; those_who in the Eucharist recognize_the nature both of a sacrament and of a sacrifice , and those_who say that_it_-isaia- nothing_more than the memorial or commemoration of the Lord s Supper ; those who_believe it to be good and useful to invoke by prayer the Saints reigning with Christ , especially Mary the Mother of God , and to venerate their images , and those_who urge that_such a veneration -isaia- not to be made use of , for it -isaia- contrary to the honor due to Jesus Christ , '' the one mediator of God and men . '' How so great a variety of opinions can_make the way clear to effect the unity of the Church We know not ; that_unity can_only arise from one teaching_authority , one law of belief and one faith of Christians . But We do know_that from this it -isaia- an easy step to the neglect of religion or indifferentism and to modernism , as they call it . Those , who_are unhappily infected with_these errors , hold that dogmatic truth_-isaia- not absolute but relative , that_-isaia- , it agrees with the varying necessities of time_and_place and with the varying tendencies of the mind , since_it_-isaia- not contained in immutable revelation , but_-isaia- capable of being accommodated to human_life . Besides this , in connection_with things_which must be believed , it -isaia- nowise licit to use that distinction which some have_seen fit to introduce between those articles of faith_which are fundamental and those_which are_not fundamental , as they_say , as if the former are to be accepted by all , while the latter may be left to the free assent of the faithful : for the supernatural virtue of faith_has a formal cause , namely the authority of God revealing , and this_-isaia- patient of no such distinction . For this_reason it -isaia- that all who_are truly Christ s believe , for example , the Conception of the Mother of God without stain of original_sin with the same faith as they believe the mystery of the August Trinity , and the Incarnation of our Lord just as they do the infallible teaching_authority of the Roman Pontiff , according to the sense in which it was defined by the Ecumenical Council of the Vatican . Are these truths not equally certain , or not equally to be believed , because the Church has solemnly sanctioned and defined them , some in one age and some in another , even in those times immediately before our_own ? Has not God revealed them all ? For the teaching_authority of the Church , which in the divine wisdom was constituted on earth in order_that revealed doctrines might remain intact for ever , and that they_might be brought with ease and security to the knowledge of men , and which_-isaia- daily exercised through the Roman Pontiff and the Bishops who_are in communion with_him , has_also the office of defining , when it sees fit , any truth with solemn rites and decrees , whenever this_-isaia- necessary either to oppose the errors or the attacks of heretics , or more_clearly and in greater detail to stamp the minds of the faithful with the articles of sacred doctrine which_have_been explained . But in the use of this extraordinary teaching_authority no newly invented matter -isaia- brought in , nor_-isaia- anything new added to the number of those truths_which are_-atti_degli_apostoli- least implicitly contained in the deposit of Revelation , divinely handed_down to the Church : only those_which are made clear which perhaps may still seem obscure to some , or that_which some have previously called into question -isaia- declared to be of faith . So , Venerable Brethren , it -isaia- clear why this Apostolic See has_never allowed its subjects to take_part in the assemblies of non Catholics : for the union of Christians can_only be promoted by promoting the return to the one true Church of Christ of those_who_are separated_from it , for in the past they_have unhappily left it . To the one true Church of Christ , we say , which_-isaia- visible to all , and which_-isaia- to remain , according to the will of its Author , exactly the same as He instituted it . During the lapse of centuries , the mystical Spouse of Christ has_never been contaminated , nor_can she ever in the future be contaminated , as Cyprian bears_witness : '' The Bride of Christ cannot be made false to her Spouse : she_-isaia- incorrupt and modest . She knows but_one dwelling , she guards the sanctity of the nuptial chamber chastely and modestly . '' The same holy Martyr with good_reason marveled exceedingly that anyone could believe_that '' this_unity in the Church which arises from a divine foundation , and which_-isaia- knit together by heavenly sacraments , could be rent and torn asunder by the force of contrary wills . '' For since_the mystical_body of Christ , in the same manner as His physical body , -isaia- one , compacted and fitly joined together , it were foolish and out of place to say that the mystical_body -isaia- made up of members which_are disunited and scattered abroad : whosoever therefore -isaia- not united with the body -isaia- no member of it , neither -isaia- he in communion with Christ its head . Furthermore , in this one Church of Christ no man can be or remain who_does_not accept , recognize and obey the authority and supremacy of Peter and his legitimate successors . Did not the ancestors of those_who_are now entangled in the errors of Photius and the reformers , obey the Bishop of Rome , the chief shepherd of souls ? Alas their_children left the home of their fathers , but it did_not fall to the ground and perish for ever , for it was supported by God . Let them therefore return to their common Father , who , forgetting the insults previously heaped on the Apostolic See , will receive them in the most loving fashion . For if , as they continually state , they long to be united with Us and ours , why do they not hasten to enter_the Church , '' the Mother and mistress of all Christ s faithful '' ? Let them hear Lactantius crying out : '' The Catholic Church -isaia- alone in keeping the true worship . This -isaia- the fount of truth , this_the house of Faith , this_the temple of God : if any man enter not here , or if any man go forth_from it , he -isaia- a stranger to the hope of life and salvation . Let none delude himself_with obstinate wrangling . For life and salvation are here concerned , which_will be lost and entirely destroyed , unless their interests are carefully and assiduously kept in mind . Let , therefore , the separated children draw nigh to the Apostolic See , set up in the City which Peter and Paul , the Princes of the Apostles , consecrated by their blood ; to that See , We repeat , which_-isaia- '' the root and womb whence the Church of God springs , '' not_with the intention and the hope_that '' the Church of the living God , the pillar and ground of the truth '' will cast aside the integrity of the faith and tolerate their errors , but , on the contrary , that they_themselves submit to its teaching and government . Would that it were Our happy lot to do that_which so many of Our predecessors could_not , to embrace with fatherly affection those children , whose unhappy separation from Us We now bewail . Would that God our Savior , '' Who will_have all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth , '' would hear us when We humbly beg that He would deign to recall all who stray to the unity of the Church ! In this_most important undertaking We ask and wish_that others should ask the prayers of Blessed Mary the Virgin , Mother of divine_grace , victorious over all heresies and Help of Christians , that She may implore for Us the speedy coming of the much hoped for day , when all men shall hear_the voice of Her divine Son , and shall be '' careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace . You , Venerable Brethren , understand how_much this_question -isaia- in Our mind , and We desire_that Our children should_also know , not_only those_who belong to the Catholic community , but_also those_who_are separated_from Us : if these latter humbly beg light from heaven , there_-isaia- no doubt but that_they_will recognize_the one true Church of Jesus Christ and will , -atti_degli_apostoli- last , enter it , being united with us in perfect charity . While awaiting this event , and as a pledge of Our paternal good_will , We impart most lovingly to you , Venerable Brethren , and to your clergy_and_people , the apostolic_benediction .
