This excellent experiment now offers Us a most welcome opportunity of manifesting more_fully Our thought in regard to a matter which touches intimately the moral and religious_life of the entire Christian people . First of all , We express Our gratitude to the Hierarchy of the United States of America and to the faithful_who cooperated with_them , for the important results already achieved , under their direction and guidance , by the '' Legion of Decency '' . And Our gratitude -isaia- all the livelier for the fact_that We were deeply anguished to note with each passing day the lamentable progress magni passus extra viam of the motion picture art and industry in the portrayal of sin and vice . PREVIOUS WARNINGS RECALLED As often as the occasion has presented itself , We have considered it the duty of Our high Office to direct to this condition the attention not_only of the Episcopate and the Clergy but_also of all men_who are right minded and solicitous for the public weal . In the Encyclical '' Divini illius Magistri '' , We had_already deplored that '' potent instrumentalities of publicity such as the cinema which might be of great advantage to learning and to education were they properly directed by healthy principles , often unfortunately serve as an incentive to evil passions and are subordinated to sordid gain '' . The Influence of the Motion Picture In August , addressing Ourselves to a delegation of the International Federation of the Motion Picture Press , We pointed_out the very great_importance which_the motion picture has acquired in our days and its vast influence alike in the promotion of good and in the insinuation of evil , and We called to mind that_it_-isaia- necessary to apply to the cinema the supreme rule which_must direct and regulate the great gift of art in order that_it_may not find itself in continual conflict with Christian morality or even with simple human morality based upon the natural_law . The essential purpose of art , its raison d \u00eatre , -isaia- to assist in the perfection of the moral personality , which_-isaia- man , and for this_reason it must itself be moral . And We concluded amidst the manifest approval of that elect body the memory -isaia- still dear to Us by recommending to them the necessity of making the motion picture '' moral , an influence for good morals , an educator '' . And even recently , in April of this_year , when We had the happiness of receiving in audience a group of delegates to the International Congress of the Motion Picture Press , held -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , We again drew attention to the gravity of the problem and We warmly exhorted all men of goodwill , in the name not_only of religion but_also of the true moral and civil welfare of the people , to use every_means in their_power , such as the Press , to make of the cinema a valuable auxiliary of instruction and education rather_than of destruction and ruin of souls . The Needs of the Entire Catholic World The subject , however , -isaia- of such paramount importance in itself and because of the present condition of society that We deem it necessary to return to it again , not alone for the purpose of making particular recommendations as on past occasions but_rather with a universal outlook which , while embracing the needs of your_own dioceses , Venerable Brethren , takes into consideration those of the entire Catholic world . It -isaia- , in fact , urgently necessary to make provision that in this_field also the progress of the arts , of the sciences , and of human technique and industry , since_they are all true gifts of God , may be ordained to His glory and to the salvation_of_souls and may be made to serve in a practical way to promote the extension of the Kingdom of God upon earth . Thus , as the Church bids us pray , we may all profit by them but in such a manner as not to lose the goods eternal : '' sic transeamus per bona temporalia ut non admittamus aeterna '' . Now then , it -isaia- a certainty which_can readily be verified that the more marvellous the progress of the motion picture art and industry , the more pernicious and deadly has it shown itself to morality and to religion and even to the very decencies of human_society . The directors of the industry in the United States recognised this_fact themselves when_they confessed that the responsibility before the people and the world was their_very own . In an agreement entered into by common accord in March , , and solemnly sealed , signed , and published in the Press , they formally pledged themselves to safeguard for the future the moral welfare of the patrons of the cinema . It -isaia- promised in this agreement that no film which lowers the moral standard of the spectators , which casts discredit upon natural or human law or arouses sympathy for their violation , will be produced . Promises not carried_out Nevertheless , in spite of this wise and spontaneously taken decision , those responsible showed themselves incapable of carrying it into_effect and it appeared that the producers and the operators were_not disposed to stand by the principles to which_they had bound themselves . Since , therefore , the above mentioned undertaking proved to have but slight effect and since_the parade of vice and crime continued on the screen , the road seemed almost closed to those_who sought honest diversion in the motion picture . In this crisis , you , Venerable Brethren , were among the first to study the means of safeguarding the souls entrusted_to_your care , and you launched the '' Legion of Decency '' as a crusade for public morality designed to revitalize the ideals of natural and Christian rectitude . Far from you was_the thought of doing damage to the motion picture industry : rather indeed did you arm it beforehand against the ruin which menaces every_form of recreation which , in the guise of art , degenerates into corruption . The '' Legion of Decency '' Pledge Your leadership called forth the prompt and devoted loyalty of your faithful people , and millions of American Catholics signed the pledge of the '' Legion of Decency '' binding themselves not to attend any motion picture which_was offensive to Catholic moral principles or proper standards of living . We are thus able to proclaim joyfully that few problems of these latter times have so closely united Bishops and people as the one resolved by cooperation in this_holy crusade . Not only Catholics but_also high minded Protestants , Jews , and many_others accepted your lead and joined their_efforts with yours in restoring wise standards , both artistic and moral , to the cinema . It -isaia- an exceedingly great comfort to Us to note the outstanding success of the crusade . Because of your vigilance and because of the pressure which_has_been brought to bear by public opinion , the motion picture has shown an improvement from the moral standpoint : crime and vice are portrayed less frequently ; sin -isaia-_no_longer so openly approved and acclaimed ; false ideals of life are no longer presented in so flagrant a manner to the impressionable minds of youth . A Useful Impetus Although in certain quarters it was predicted that the artistic values of the motion picture would be seriously impaired by the reform insisted upon by the '' Legion of Decency , '' it appears that quite the contrary has happened and that the '' Legion of Decency '' has_given no little impetus to the efforts to advance the cinema on the road to noble artistic significance by directing it towards_the production of classic masterpieces as well as of original creations of uncommon worth . Nor have_the financial investments of the industry suffered , as was gratuitously foretold , for_many of those_who stayed away from the motion picture theatre because it outraged morality are patronizing it now that_they_are able to enjoy clean films which_are not offensive to good morals or dangerous to Christian virtue . When you started your crusade , it was said_that your efforts would be of short duration and that the effects would_not be lasting because , as the vigilance of Bishops and faithful gradually diminished , the producers would be free to return again to their former methods . It -isaia- not difficult to understand why certain of these might be desirous of going back to the sinister themes which pander to base desires and which_you had proscribed . While the representation of subjects of real artistic value and the portrayal of the vicissitudes of human virtue require intellectual effort , toil , ability , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times considerable outlay of money , it -isaia-_often relatively easy to attract a certain type of person and certain classes of people to a theatre which presents picture plays calculated to inflame the passions and to arouse the lower instincts latent in the human_heart . An unceasing and universal vigilance must , on the contrary , convince the producers that the '' Legion of Decency '' has not_been started as a crusade of short duration , soon to be neglected and forgotten , but_that the Bishops of the United States are determined , -atti_degli_apostoli- all times and -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs , to safeguard the recreation of the people whatever form that recreation may take . THE POWER OF THE CINEMA Recreation , in its manifold varieties , has become a necessity for people_who work under the fatiguing conditions of modern industry , but it must be worthy of the rational nature of man and therefore must be morally healthy . It must be elevated to the rank of a positive factor for good and must seek to arouse noble sentiments . A people_who , in time of repose , give themselves to diversions which violate decency , honour , or morality , to recreations which , especially to the young , constitute occasions of sin , are in grave danger of losing their greatness and even their national power . It admits of no discussion that the motion picture has achieved these last years a position of universal importance among modern means of diversion . The most Popular Form of Amusement There -isaia- no need to point_out the fact_that millions of people go to the motion pictures every_day ; that motion picture theatres are_being opened in ever_increasing number in civilized and semi civilized countries ; that the motion picture has become the most popular form of diversion which_-isaia- offered for the leisure hours not_only of the rich but of all classes of society . At the same_time , there does not_exist today a means of influencing the masses more potent than the cinema . The reason_for this_-isaia- to be sought for in the very nature of the pictures projected upon the screen , in the popularity of motion picture plays , and in the circumstances which accompany them . The power of the motion picture consists in this , that it speaks by means of vivid and concrete imagery which_the mind takes in with enjoyment and without fatigue . Even the crudest and most primitive minds which_have neither the capacity nor the desire to make_the efforts necessary_for abstraction or deductive reasoning are captivated by the cinema . In place of the effort which reading or listening demands , there_-isaia- the continued pleasure of a succession of concrete and , so to speak , living pictures . This power -isaia- still greater in the talking picture for the reason_that interpretation becomes even easier and the charm of music -isaia- added to the action of the drama . Dances and variety acts which_are sometimes introduced between_the films serve to increase the stimulation of the passions . It must be Elevated Since then the cinema -isaia- in reality a sort of object lesson which , for good or for evil , teaches the majority of men more_effectively than abstract reasoning , it must be elevated to conformity_with_the aims of a Christian conscience and saved from depraving and demoralizing effects . Everyone knows what damage -isaia- done to the soul by bad motion pictures . They are occasions of sin ; they seduce young_people along the ways of evil by glorifying the passions ; they show life under a false light ; they cloud ideals ; they destroy pure love , respect_for marriage , affection for the family . They are capable also of creating prejudices among individuals and misunderstandings among nations , among social classes , among entire races . On the other_hand , good motion pictures are capable of exercising a profoundly moral influence upon those_who see them . In addition to affording recreation , they are_able to arouse noble ideals of life , to communicate valuable conceptions , to impart a better knowledge of the history and the beauties of the Fatherland and of other countries , to present truth and virtue under attractive forms , to create , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least to favour understanding among nations , social classes , and races , to champion the cause of justice , to give new_life to the claims of virtue , and to contribute positively to the genesis of a just social_order in the world . It Speaks not to Individuals but to Multitudes These considerations take on greater seriousness from the fact_that the cinema speaks not to individuals but to multitudes , and that it does so in circumstances of time_and_place and surroundings which_are most apt to arouse unusual enthusiasm for the good as well as for the bad and to conduce to that collective exaltation which , as experience teaches us , may assume the most morbid forms . The motion picture -isaia- viewed by people_who_are seated in a dark theatre and whose faculties , mental , physical , and often spiritual , are relaxed . One does_not need to go far in search of these theatres : they_are close to the home , to the church , and to the school and they thus bring_the cinema into the very centre of popular life . Moreover , stories and actions are presented , through the cinema , by men_and_women whose natural gifts are increased by training and embellished by every known art , in a manner which_may possibly become an additional source of corruption , especially to the young . Further , the motion picture has enlisted in its service luxurious appointments , pleasing music , the vigour of realism , every_form of whim and fancy . For this_very reason , it attracts and fascinates particularly the young , the adolescent , and even the child . Thus -atti_degli_apostoli- the very age when_the moral sense -isaia- being formed and when_the notions and sentiments of justice and rectitude , of duty and obligation and of ideals of life are_being developed , the motion picture with its direct propaganda assumes a position of commanding influence . It -isaia- unfortunate that , in the present state of affairs , this influence -isaia- frequently exerted for evil . So much so that_when one thinks of the havoc wrought in the souls of youth and of childhood , of the loss of innocence so often suffered in the motion picture theatres , there comes to mind the terrible condemnation pronounced by Our Lord upon the corrupters of little ones : '' whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones who_believe in Me , it were better for him_that a millstone be hanged about his neck and that he be drowned in the depths of the sea '' . It must_not be a School of Corruption It -isaia- therefore one of the supreme necessities , of our_times to watch and to labour to the end that the motion picture be no longer a school of corruption but_that it be transformed into an effectual instrument for the education and the elevation of mankind . And here We record with pleasure that certain Governments , in their anxiety for the influence exercised by the cinema in the moral and educational fields , have , with the aid of upright and honest persons , especially fathers and mothers of families , set up reviewing commissions and have constituted other agencies which_have to do with motion picture production in an effort to direct the cinema for inspiration to the national works of great poets and writers . It was most fitting and desirable that_you , Venerable Brethren , should_have exercised a special watchfulness over the motion picture industry which in your_country -isaia- so highly developed and which_has great influence in other quarters of the globe . It -isaia- equally the duty of the Bishops of the entire Catholic world to unite in vigilance over this universal and potent form of entertainment and instruction , to the end that_they_may be able to place a ban on bad motion pictures because_they_are an offence to the moral and religious sentiments and because_they_are in opposition to the Christian spirit and to its ethical principles . There must be no weariness in combating whatever contributes to the lessening of the people s sense of decency and of honour . This -isaia- an obligation which binds not_only the Bishops but_also the faithful and all decent men_who are solicitous for the decorum amd moral health of the family , of the nation , and of human_society in general . In what , then , must this vigilance consist ? III . A WORK FOR CATHOLIC ACTION The problem of the production of moral films would be solved radically if it were possible_for us to have production wholly inspired by the principles of Christian morality . We can_never sufficiently praise all those_who_have dedicated themselves or who_are to dedicate themselves to the noble cause of raising the standard of the motion picture to meet_the needs of education and the requirements of the Christian conscience . For this_purpose , they_must make full use of the technical ability of experts and not permit the waste of effort and of money by the employment of amateurs . But since We know_how difficult it -isaia- to organize such an industry , especially because of considerations of a financial nature , and since on the other_hand it -isaia- necessary to influence the production of all films so that_they_may contain nothing harmful from a religious , moral , or social viewpoint , Pastors of souls must exercise their vigilance over films wherever they_may be produced and offered to Christian peoples . To the Bishops of all Countries As to the motion picture industry itself , We exhort the Bishops of all countries , but in particular you , Venerable Brethren , to address an appeal to those Catholics who hold important positions in this industry . Let them take serious thought of their_duties and of the responsibility which_they_have as children of the Church to use their influence and authority for the promotion of principles of sound morality in the films which_they produce or aid in producing . There are surely many Catholics among the executives , directors , authors , and actors who take_part in this business , and it -isaia- unfortunate that_their influence has not always_been in accordance_with their Faith and with_their ideals . You will do well , Venerable Brethren , to pledge them to bring their profession into harmony_with their conscience as respectable men and followers of Jesus Christ . In this as in every_other field of the apostolate , Pastors of souls will surely find_their best fellow workers in those_who fight in the ranks of Catholic Action , and in this_letter We cannot refrain from addressing to them a warm appeal that_they give to this cause their full contribution and their unwearying and unfailing activity . From time to time , the Bishops will do well to recall to the motion picture industry that , amid the cares of their pastoral_ministry , they_are under obligation to interest themselves in every_form of decent and healthy recreation because_they_are responsible before God for the moral welfare of their_people even during their time of leisure . The Moral Fibre of a Nation Their sacred calling constrains them to proclaim clearly and openly that unhealthy and impure entertainment destroys the moral fibre of a nation . They will likewise remind the motion picture industry that the demands which_they make regard not_only the Catholics but all who patronize the cinema . In particular , you , Venerable Brethren of the United States , will_be_able to insist with justice that the industry of your_country has recognized and accepted its responsibility before society . The Bishops of the whole_world will take_care to make clear to the leaders of the motion picture industry that a force of such power and universality as the cinema can be directed , with_great utility , to the highest ends of individual and social improvement . Why indeed should there be question merely of avoiding what_-isaia- evil ? The motion picture should_not be simply a means of diversion , a light relaxation to occupy an idle hour ; with its magnificent power , it can and must be a bearer of light and a positive guide to what_-isaia-_good . And now , in view of the gravity of the subject , We consider it timely to come down to certain practical indications . A Yearly Promise from the Faithful Above all , all Pastors of souls will undertake to obtain each year from their_people a pledge similar to the one already alluded to which_-isaia- given by their American brothers and in which_they promise to stay away from motion picture plays which_are offensive to truth and to Christian morality . The most efficacious manner of obtaining these pledges or promises -isaia- through the parish church or school and by enlisting the earnest cooperation of all fathers and mothers of families who_are conscious of their grave responsibilities . The Bishops will_also be able to avail themselves of the Catholic Press for the purpose of bringing home to the people the moral beauty and the effectiveness of this promise . The fulfilment of this pledge supposes that the people be told plainly which films are permitted to all , which_are permitted with reservations , and which_are harmful or positively bad . This requires the prompt , regular , and frequent publication of classified lists of motion picture plays so as to make_the information readily accessible to all . Special bulletins or other timely publications , such as the daily Catholic Press , may be used for this_purpose . Were it possible , it would in itself be desirable to establish a single list for the entire world because all live under the same moral_law . Since , however , there_-isaia- here question of pictures which interest all classes of society , the great and the humble , the learned and the unlettered , the judgment passed upon a film cannot be the same in each case and in all respects . Indeed circumstances , usages , and forms vary from country to country so that it does_not seem practical to have a single list for all the world . If , however , films were classified in each country in the manner indicated above , the resultant list would offer in principle the guidance needed . A National Reviewing Office Therefore , it will be necessary_that in each country the Bishops set up a permanent national reviewing office in order to be able to promote good motion pictures , classify the others , and bring this judgment to the knowledge of priests and faithful . It will be very proper to entrust this agency to the central organization of Catholic Action which_-isaia- dependent on the Bishops . At all events , it must be clearly laid_down that_this service of information , in order to function organically and with efficiency , must be on a national basis and that it must be carried on by a single centre of responsibility . Should grave reasons really require it , the Bishops , in their_own dioceses and through_their diocesan reviewing committees , will_be_able to apply to the national list which_must use standards adaptable to the whole nation such severer criterions as may be demanded by the character of the region , and they_may even censor films which_were admitted to the general list . Films in Parish Halls The above mentioned Office will likewise look after_the organization of existing motion picture theatres belonging to parishes and to Catholic associations so that_they_may be guaranteed reviewed and approved films . Through the organization of these halls , which are_often known to the cinema industry as good clients , it will be possible to advance a new claim , namely that the industry produce motion pictures which conform entirely to our standards . Such films may then readily be shown not_only in the Catholic halls but_also in others . We realize_that the establishment of such an Office will involve a certain sacrifice , a certain expense for Catholics of the various countries . Yet the great_importance of the motion picture and the necessity of safeguarding the morality of the Christian people and of the entire nation makes this sacrifice more_than justified . Indeed the effectiveness of our schools , of our Catholic associations , and even of our churches -isaia- lessened and endangered by the plague of evil and pernicious motion pictures . Care must_be_taken that the Office -isaia- composed of persons_who are familiar with the technique of the motion picture and who_are , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , well grounded in the principles of Catholic morality and doctrine . They must , in addition , be under_the_guidance and the direct supervision of a priest chosen by the Bishops . Exchange of Information A mutual exchange of advice and information between_the Offices of the various countries will conduce to greater efficiency and harmony in the work of reviewing films , while due consideration will be given to varying conditions and circumstances . It will thus be possible to achieve unity of outlook in the judgments and in the communications which appear in the Catholic Press of the world . These Offices will profit not_only from the experiments made in the United States but_also from the work_which Catholics in other countries have achieved in the motion picture field . Even if employees of the Office with the best of good_will and intentions should make an occasional mistake , as happens in all human affairs , the Bishops , in their pastoral prudence , will know_how to apply effective remedies and to safeguard in every possible way the authority and prestige of the Office itself . This may be done by strengthening the staff with more influential men or by replacing those_who_have shown themselves not entirely suited to so delicate a position of trust . Painstaking Vigilance If the Bishops of the world assume their share in the exercise of this painstaking vigilance over the motion picture and of this We who know their pastoral zeal have no doubt they_will certainly accomplish a great work_for the protection of the morality of their_people in their hours of leisure and recreation . They will win the approbation and the approval of all right thinking men , Catholic and non Catholic , and they_will help to assure that a great international force the motion picture shall be directed towards_the noble end of promoting the highest ideals and the truest standards of life . That these wishes and prayers which We pour forth_from a father s heart may gain in virtue , We implore the help of the grace of God and in pledge thereof We impart to you , Venerable Brethren , and to the Clergy and people entrusted to you , Our loving Apostolic Benediction .
