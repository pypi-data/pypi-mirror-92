In reviewing attentively the history of the Church , one cannot_fail to notice how , from the first ages of Christianity , the especial care and solicitude of the Roman Pontiffs have_been directed to the end that_they , undeterred by difficulties and obstacles , might spread the light of the Gospel and the benefits of Christian culture and civilization to the peoples who '' sat in darkness and in the shadow of death . '' The Church has no other reason_for existence than , by developing the Kingdom of Christ on earth , to make mankind participate in the effects of His saving Redemption . Whoever , by Divine Commission , takes the place on earth of Jesus Christ , becomes thereby the Chief Shepherd who , far_from_being able to rest content with simply guiding and protecting the Lord s Flock which_has beer ; confided to him to rule , fails in his special duty and obligations if he does_not strive by might and main to win over and to join to Christ all who are_still without_the Fold . It -isaia- a well_known fact_that Our Predecessors fulfilled -atti_degli_apostoli- all times the Divine Commission wherewith they_were charged of teaching and baptizing all nations , that the priests sent by them many of whom_the Church publicly venerates because of the holiness of their_lives or because_they so courageously suffered martyrdom zealously strove with varying results to enlighten by the Faith first Europe , and , later on , even unknown lands , and this almost immediately after their discovery . We say '' with varying results , '' for it sometimes happened that the missionaries after laboring with little or no effect were either put to death or driven out of the country . As a result , the field which_they had begun to cultivate , -atti_degli_apostoli- times a mere wilderness but_-atti_degli_apostoli- other times already converted by them_into a veritable garden of roses , when left to itself was once_again overrun with thorns and briars . In spite of all this , it -isaia- a great consolation to see_how in recent_years the Congregations which_are devoted to foreign missionary work have actually redoubled their labors and have gained such memorable fruits from their_work , and how the faithful , on their_part , have so generously responded to this increased missionary effort with a great increase in the amount of alms given for_such holy purposes . There -isaia- no doubt_that this renewed activity was greatly promoted by the Apostolic Letter of November , , entitled , On the Propagation of the Catholic Faith Throughout the World , which Our Predecessor of happy_memory directed to the episcopate of the whole_world . In this_letter , while the Pontiff on the one_hand stimulated the diligence and zeal of all the bishops in the work of obtaining help for the missions , he did not_fail to point_out , and very wisely , to Apostolic Vicars and Prefects , the obstacles to be avoided and the methods to be followed by their clergy in order to render more fruitful the exercise of the sacred apostolate . As for Ourselves , Venerable Brothers , you well know_that , from the beginning of Our Pontificate , We determined to leave nothing undone which might , by means of apostolic preachers , extend farther and farther the light of the Gospel and make easy for heathen nations the way unto salvation . It seems to Us that two special objectives ought to be aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- in all missionary work , both of which_are not_only timely but necessary and closely connected_with each_other ; namely_,_that a much larger number than heretofore of missionaries , well trained in the different fields of knowledge , be sent into the vast regions which are_still deprived of the civilizing influence of the Christian religion ; and secondly , that_the_faithful be brought to understand with what zeal , constancy in prayer , and with what generosity they too must co operate in a work which_-isaia- so holy and fruitful . This -isaia- precisely_the object We had in mind when We commanded that the Vatican Missionary Exhibition be held . We thank God that many_young hearts a fact which_has_been called to Our attention -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of these proofs of divine_grace and of the nobility and greatness of the missionaries , received there the first call to the missionary life . So unbounded , too , was_the admiration for the missionaries on the part of those_who visited the Exhibition that We have every reason to believe_that it will_not be without lasting fruits for religion . That the weighty lessons which_this Exhibition in its silent eloquence preached may_not be forgotten , We ordered , as you perhaps know already , that a permanent museum be established wherein there_may be conserved and shown to the public the more noteworthy objects exhibited -atti_degli_apostoli- the Vatican Missionary Exhibition . This Museum will be established in our Palace of the Lateran on the very spot where , after peace had_been restored to the Church , so many apostolic men celebrated for holiness of life and zeal for religion were sent forth , century after century , by Our Predecessors into regions '' already white for the harvest . It will_also come about_that all the officers in the mission army , and the privates too , if We may so speak , who shall visit this Museum , after_having compared the conditions of their_respective missions and their methods of work , will draw from it inspiration for even better and larger projects . The faithful_who visit the Museum will , We believe , experience the self same feelings as did those_who attended the original Vatican Exhibition . Meanwhile , in order_that the interest of the faithful in the missions , which_has_been aroused already , may be even further developed We make a special appeal for your assistance in this_task , Venerable Brothers . If your assistance may rightly be employed in any undertaking , certainly the dignity of your station in life , to say nothing of your filial affection for Us , will impel you to tender such aid particularly in this_work and that_with all zeal and diligence . For Our part , so long as Divine Providence shall preserve Our life , this_duty of Our Apostolic office will_always be a special obligation to us , for when We ponder over the fact_that the pagans number , even in our_day , almost a billion , '' We have no rest in our spirit '' II Cor . vii , and seem to hear sounding in Our ears the words , '' Cry , cease not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet . There -isaia- no need to insist how foreign it -isaia- to the virtue of charity , which embraces both God and men , for the members of Christ s Church not to think of those unfortunate souls who_live in error outside the Fold . Surely the obligation of charity , which binds us to God , demands not_only that we strive to increase by every_means within our power the number of those_who adore Him '' in spirit and in truth '' John iv , but also_that we try to bring under the rule of the gentle Christ as many_other men as possible in order_that '' the profit in his_blood '' Psalms xxix , may be the more_and_more fruitful and that_we_may make ourselves the more acceptable to Him to Whom nothing can possibly be more pleasing than_that '' men should be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth . Since Jesus Christ has proclaimed that the special sign of discipleship with Him -isaia- that we '' have love_one for another '' John xiii , ; xv , can we give a mark of greater love for our neighbors than to assist them in putting behind themselves the darkness of error by instructing them in the true faith of Christ ? As a matter of fact , this type of charity surpasses all other kinds of good_works inspired by love just as the mind surpasses the body , heaven surpasses earth , eternity surpasses time . Every one_that acts thus , inspired by love and according to the full measure of his ability , demonstrates that he esteems the gift of faith in the manner that one_should esteem it . Moreover , he manifests his gratitude toward_the goodness of God by thus sharing this_same great gift , precious above every_other gift , with the poor pagans . He also shares with_them , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , all the other graces which_are intimately connected_with_the virtue of faith . If none of the faithful -isaia- exempt from the obligation of charity , can the clergy who , by their truly marvelous election and holy vocation , participate in the very priesthood and apostolate of Jesus Christ , claim such exemption ? Or can you , Venerable Brothers , you_who possess the plenitude of the priesthood and are , each in his_own diocese , the divinely constituted pastors of the clergy and Christian people , claim to be exempt from the same law of love ? We read that Christ commanded not_only Peter , whose chair We occupy , but all the Apostles whose successors you_are : '' Go ye into the whole_world , and preach_the_gospel to every_creature . '' Mark xvi , It evidently follows from this_that the responsibility_for spreading the faith falls upon Us , but on condition that_you share_with Us the burden and assist Us as much as your_own pastoral duties permit . Therefore , Venerable Brothers , do not look upon compliance with this Our paternal exhortation , as an irksome duty , for you_must know_that God Himself shall one_day ask of us a strict accounting of this tremendous obligation which He has laid upon Us . In the first_place , both in sermons and by your writings , strive to have introduced and gradually to extend the pious custom of praying '' the Lord of the harvest , that he send forth laborers into_his harvest '' Matt . ix , and of asking for the heathen the light of the Holy Spirit and the grace of God . We say that_these prayers should become habitual for it -isaia- evident_that prayers said in this manner cannot_but have more efficacy before the seat of Divine Mercy than prayers said but once or only occasionally . Even though the missionaries labor most zealously , though_they work and toil and go so far as to lay_down their_very lives in order to bring to the pagans a knowledge of the Catholic religion , though_they employ every_means known to human ingenuity and spare themselves in nothing , all this_will avail them nothing , all their_efforts will go for naught , if God by His grace does_not touch the hearts of the heathen in order to soften and attract them to Himself . Everyone can pray , of this_fact there_can be no question . Everyone , therefore , has -atti_degli_apostoli- hand and can_make use of this all important help , this daily nourishment of the missions . For these reasons you will act according to Our desires and will_also do something in keeping_with_the religious spirit and feelings of the faithful , if you order_that special prayers for the missions and for the conversion of the heathen to the true Faith be added , for example , to the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin or to the other prayers which_are customarily recited both in the parish and other_churches . It would be well , Venerable Brothers , to make a special point of inviting and encouraging children and the religious_orders of women to take up this_holy practice . We are particularly desirous that in all institutions , orphan asylums , parochial schools , colleges , and convents of Sisters there_should daily arise to heaven the prayer that the Divine Mercy may descend upon so many unhappy beings , inhabitants of the densely populated pagan countries . Can the Heavenly Father refuse anything to the innocent and chaste who ask it of Him ? On the other_hand , such a pious practice leads to the hope that_these children , who_have_been trained to pray_for the conversion of the heathen from the first moment when_the flower of charity begins to bud in their young and tender hearts , may , with the help of God , themselves receive a vocation for the apostolate , a vocation which if it -isaia- nurtured with care may perhaps in time supply capable workers for the mission field . At this_point , Venerable Brothers , We wish to touch upon in passing a matter which_-isaia- worthy of your most serious thought . All are acquainted , no doubt , with the grave damage which_was done to the propagation_of_the_faith as a result of the late War . Missionaries recalled to their_own countries fell in the terrible conflict . Other missionaries were compelled to leave the field of their activities with the result that missionary work suffered greatly thereby . These damages and losses to the missions have to be made good if we hope to bring them back to the state in which_they were before the War and to insure their further progress . Moreover , when we stop to consider_the vast territory which remains as yet unopened to the blessings of Christian culture , the immense number of those_who_are still deprived of the fruits of the Redemption , or the obstacles and difficulties which beset and impede the best efforts of the missionary , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that the bishops and faithful work together in order_that the number of the ambassadors of Christ be increased and multiplied . If there_should be in your dioceses , any young_men , seminarians , or priests_who seem called by God to this sublime apostolate , far from putting obstacles in their_way , you_should encourage them both by your favor and authority in their leanings and desires . Though you_are surely permitted in regard to these vocations '' to try the spirits if they be of God '' I John iv , still if you_are convinced_that their holy resolution springs from and -isaia- fostered by the Spirit of God , then neither scarcity of priests , nor any special need of your_own diocese ought to discourage you or keep you from giving your consent to the vocation of anyone , since your_own faithful have -atti_degli_apostoli- hand , if We may use the phrase , the means to salvation , and are less further removed from them than the heathens , especially_those who are_still savages or are only semicivilized . If , therefore , the occasion should arise , suffer patiently for the love of Christ and of souls , the loss of one of your_clergy , if indeed it can rightly be called as loss . If you deprive yourself of a co laborer and sharer of your toils , the Divine Founder of the Church will surely supply every such deficiency by showering more abundant blessings on your diocese and by bringing into existence more_and_more new vocations to the sacred_ministry . In order_that this particular work may be joined intimately to the other duties of your pastoral_office , see_to_it_that the Missionary Union of the Clergy be established in your diocese , and if this has_already_been done , encourage the organization by your counsels , your exhortations , and your authority to renewed activity . This Union , founded providentially eight years_ago by Our immediate Predecessor , has_been enriched by numerous indulgences and put under the special jurisdiction of the Sacred Congregation of the Propaganda . In these last years it has spread through many dioceses of the Catholic world . We Ourselves have bestowed upon the Union , and this more_than_once , testimonials of Our pontifical well wishes . Great -isaia- the number of priests , as well as ecclesiastical students , who belong to the Missionary Union and who pray , each according_to_his particular state in life , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the Holy sacrifice of the Mass , and encourage likewise others to pray , that the gift of faith be bestowed upon the almost limitless number of pagans . On every possible occasion they preach to the people about the apostolate which_-isaia- carried on among the heathen . They also see_to_it_that -atti_degli_apostoli- certain specified times conferences , which_are of great and lasting value , are held on mission work . They distribute mission literature and wherever they discover some one who_gives indications of possessing a vocation to the missionary life , they assist him in obtaining the preparation necessary_for such work . They encourage and promote , too , in every possible way , each within_the limits of his_own diocese , both the work of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith and its two allied and subsidiary activities . You are assuredly aware , Venerable Brothers , of the large amounts of money which_the Missionary Union of the Clergy has_already collected to help these good_works , and what wonderful prospects they_have in the future of collecting even_more , due to the increased generosity of the faithful from year to year . Some of you have_been patrons and sponsors of the Missionary Union in your dioceses . It -isaia- Our supreme desire_that from now on it will be impossible to point to a cleric who_-isaia- not literally burning with love for the missions . All Christian people should assist , and generously , the work of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith , the principal mission organization of the Church . With due regard_for the very pious woman who_was its foundress , and the City of Lyons , its seat , We have transferred to Rome the Society for the Propagation of the Faith . We have_also reorganized it , conferred upon it , as it were , Roman citizenship , and given it charge of meeting all the present needs of the missions , as well as those_that will arise in the future . How many and how_great these needs , how poor the great majority of missionaries was assuredly made plain by the Vatican Missionary Exhibition , despite the fact_that many who visited the Exhibition , dazzled by the abundance , novelty , and attractiveness of what_they saw , did_not sufficiently appreciate this_fact . Do not be ashamed , Venerable Brothers , to make yourselves even beggars for Christ and the salvation_of_souls . Both by your writings and the eloquence of your words , which come from the depths of your hearts , insist that your_people by their renewed interest in and generosity toward_the missions , increase and render more abundant the harvest which_the Society for the Propagation of the Faith -isaia- gathering every year . Since no one_can be thought so poor and naked , no one so infirm or hungry , as he who_-isaia- deprived of the knowledge and grace of God , so there_-isaia- no one_who cannot understand_that both the mercy and the rewards of God shall be given to him_who , on his part , shows mercy to the neediest of his fellow beings . With the head organization , the Society for the Propagation of the Faith , there_are affiliated , as We have written , two other societies the Association of the Holy Childhood and the Society of St . Peter the Apostle . Since the Holy See has made these latter organizations in a peculiar manner its_own , the faithful from all over the world ought to help and maintain them by their offerings , and this in preference to other pious works whose aims are more_or_less specialized . The object of the Association of the Holy Childhood -isaia- , as -isaia- well_known , to train children so that_they_will accustom themselves to set_aside a certain amount of their money allowance in order to give the same for the redemption and Catholic education of heathen babies who_have_been abandoned by their_parents or have_been exposed to death as often happens in certain lands . The object of the Society of St . Peter the Apostle -isaia- , by means of prayers and free will gifts , to make it possible_for certain specially chosen native ecclesiastical students to receive the required seminary training preparatory to the taking of Holy Orders . Given these native priests , people of their_own race will the more_easily be converted to Christ or be confirmed in their Faith . Recently , as you_know , We assigned to the Society of St . Peter the Apostle as its heavenly patroness St . Teresa of the Child Jesus . This Saint who , during her_life here below as a religious , made herself responsible_for and adopted , if We may use the phrase , more_than one missionary in order to assist him in his_work as was her custom by her prayers , by voluntary and prescribed corporal penances , but , above all , by offering to her Divine Spouse the dreadful sufferings resulting on the disease with_which she_was afflicted . Under the protection of the Virgin of Lisieux We , too , look forward to more abundant fruits in this_work . We , also , greatly rejoice that_many bishops have_been pleased to enroll themselves among the perpetual patrons of this Society , and that seminaries and societies of young Catholic men_have undertaken the task of meeting the expenses incident on the maintenance and education of several needy native clerical students . These two Societies are customarily called , and rightly so , branches of the principal work of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith . As they_were recommended very specially to the bishops by Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Benedict XV , in the apostolic_letter referred to above , so We also cannot_but recommend the same Societies to you , hoping that because of your exhortations and your interest in this_work the Catholic people shall never permit themselves to be outdone in generosity by non Catholics who_are wont to assist so liberally the propagators of their false beliefs . It -isaia-_now time , Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons , that We speak to you_who , because of your long labors and wise service as missionaries among the heathen , have_been found worthy to be promoted by Apostolic authority to the office of Vicars and Prefects . First of all , We speak of the general progress which_the missions have_made in the last few years due to your charity and zeal , for_which progress We offer congratulations both to you and to the missionaries under your charge . What your principal duties are and what_you especially have to guard against in the discharge of these duties , has_already_been set_forth with_such wisdom and eloquence by Our immediate Predecessor that_nothing along that line needs be added to his_words . However , over and above that , We deem it well , Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons , to make known Our own mind on certain matters . Before everything else , We call your attention to the importance of building up a native clergy . If you do not work with all your might to attain this_purpose , We assert that not_only will your apostolate be crippled , but it will_become an obstacle and an impediment to the establishment and organization of the Church in those countries . We gladly recognize and acknowledge_the fact_that in some places steps have already_been taken to provide_for these needs by the erection of seminaries in which native youths of promise are_well educated and prepared to receive the dignity of the priesthood , and are trained to instruct in the Christian Faith members of their_own race . But in spite of all this_work , we are_still a great distance from the goal which_we_have set for ourselves . You certainly have_not forgotten how Our Predecessor , Benedict XV of happy_memory , was saddened by this_fact . He wrote : '' It -isaia-_a_matter of genuine sorrow that_there still exist countries to which_the Catholic Faith was brought centuries ago but where , in spite of that fact , one does_not find even_now native priests except possibly those occupying minor posts ; also , that_there are races who_were converted long ago and who_have risen from a state of barbarism to such a high degree of civilization that_they_have produced men of standing in every profession and walk of civil life ; yet these very people , despite the fact that_they_have lived under the saving influence of the Gospel and of the Church for centuries , have_not been_able to produce a bishop to rule them or priests whose teaching_authority -isaia- respected as it should be by their fellow citizens . '' Apostolic Letter Maximum Illud . Perhaps it may be said_that sufficient attention has_never been paid to the method whereby_the Gospel began to be preached and the Church of God established all over the world . We touched on this_subject briefly -atti_degli_apostoli- the closing of the Missionary Exhibition and recalled the fact_that from a study of the earliest monuments of Christian antiquity it -isaia- clearly evident_that the clergy placed in charge of the faithful in each new community by the Apostles were_not men brought in from the outside but were chosen from the natives of that locality . From the fact_that the Roman Pontiff has_entrusted to you and to your assistants the task of preaching the Christian religion to pagan nations , you ought not to conclude that the role of the native clergy -isaia- merely one of assisting the missionaries in minor matters , of merely following up and completing their_work . What , We ask , -isaia- the true object of these holy missions if it be not this , that the Church of Christ be founded and established in these boundless regions ? How can the Church among the heathens be developed today unless it be built of those very elements out of which_our own churches were built ; that_-isaia- to say , unless it be made up of people , clergy , and religious_orders of men_and_women recruited from the native populations of the several regions ? Why should the native clergy be forbidden to cultivate their_own portion of the Lord s vineyard , be forbidden to govern their_own people ? In order to enable you to progress in winning from heathenism new converts to Christ , would it not be of great assistance if you would entrust to the native clergy the people already converted so that_they could minister to them and preserve their_faith ? As a matter of fact , the native clergy will prove to be most useful more useful than some people imagine in extending the Kingdom of Christ '' for since_the native priest , '' to quote Our Predecessor , '' by birth , temper , sentiment , and interests -isaia- in close touch with_his own people , it -isaia- beyond all controversy how valuable he can be in instilling the Faith into the minds of his_people . The native priest understands better_than any outsider how to proceed with_his own people . Such being the case , he can often gain access to places_where a foreign priest would_not be permitted to enter . '' Apostolic letter Maximum Illud . Moreover , the foreign missionary , because of his imperfect knowledge of the language often finds himself embarrassed when he attempts to express his thoughts with the result that the force and efficacy of his preaching are thereby greatly weakened . In addition to the aforementioned difficulties there_are others which must_always be taken into_account , notwithstanding the fact that_these difficulties are of rare occurrence and can oftentimes be overcome easily . Let us suppose , for example , that either because of the fortunes of war , or because of certain political happenings in a mission field , the ruling government -isaia- changed in that territory and that the new government decrees or requests that the missionaries of a certain nationality be expelled ; or let us suppose something which rarely , if ever , occurs that the inhabitants of a particular territory , having reached a fairly high degree of civilization and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a corresponding development in civic and social_life , and desiring to become free and independent , should drive away from their_country the governor , the soldiers , the missionaries of the foreign nation to whose rule they_are subject . All this , of course , cannot be done without violence . Everyone can_see what great harm would accrue to the Church in that land in the circumstances , unless a native clergy had_been spread beforehand throughout_the country like a network and were , by consequence , in a position to provide adequately for the population which_had_been converted to Christ . Moreover , since_the words of Christ '' the harvest indeed -isaia- great , but the laborers are few '' Matt . ix , ; Luke x , are true , even in the present condition of affairs , Europe from whence most of the missionaries have come -isaia- itself in need of priests , and this -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when , with the help of God , it -isaia- most important_that our separated brethren be led back to the unity of the Church and that non Catholics be convinced of and delivered from their errors . It -isaia- a well_known fact_that today the number of young_men called to the priestly and religious_life -isaia- not less_than in former times , still the number of those_who obey the call of God -isaia- certainly much smaller . From what We have written , Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons , it follows that_it_-isaia- all important to supply your different fields of labor with as many native priests as shall be sufficient , by their individual efforts , to extend the conquests of Christianity and to rule_the faithful of each nation without_the necessity of depending upon the help of a foreign clergy . In some places , as We have_already pointed_out , seminaries for the native clergy have_been opened . These seminaries are_being erected in points central to the nearby missions and entrusted , as a rule , to the same religious order or congregation which_has charge of the missions . At these central institutions the Vicars and Prefects send their chosen men and pay for them while they are_being trained , to receive them back one_day ordained priests ready for the sacred_ministry . This policy , which_has_been followed in some places , We sincerely wish , nay , We command , shall be followed likewise by the Superiors of all missions , so that it cannot be said_that any native youth has_ever been kept out of the priesthood and the apostolate , provided , of course , he exhibits the mark of a true vocation and -isaia- a young_man of genuine promise . It need scarcely be added that the greater the number of students you select for_this training there_-isaia- need of greater numbers the greater will be the expense . Do not lose heart because of this_fact , but have confidence in the most loving Savior of men to Whose Providence We must look to find ways and means whereby_the generosity of Catholics shall be stimulated so that_there may come to the Holy See the increased funds required to aid more adequately such worthy enterprises . If each of you_must do all he can to obtain as large a number as possible of native ecclesiastical students , you must_also strive to mold and form them in that sanctity which_-isaia- becoming to the priestly life and in the true spirit of the apostolate . Filled with_these virtues and with zeal for the conversion of their_brothers , they_should be ready even to lay_down their_lives for the salvation of the people of their_own tribe or nation . It -isaia-_also important_that simultaneously with this priestly formation these seminarians receive a scientific education both in the sacred and profane sciences . This education should follow_the most approved methods . The course of study should_not be unduly shortened or curtailed in any of its important features . The students as a matter of fact should follow_the general accepted course of studies . Have no fear that if in the seminary you educate subjects conspicuous for the integrity and purity of their_lives , men well prepared_for the work of the sacred_ministry and skilled teachers of the law of God , that_you will not_have turned out men who_will not_only attract the attention of the leading and learned men of their_own country but_also priests_who will be destined one_day to govern parishes and dioceses which shall be erected when it pleases God , and all this with the prospect of lasting gain for the Church . Anyone who looks upon these natives as members of an inferior race or as men of low mentality makes a grievous mistake . Experience over a long period of time has proven that the inhabitants of those remote regions of the East and of the South frequently are_not inferior to us -atti_degli_apostoli- all , and are capable of holding their_own with us , even in mental ability . If one discovers an extreme lack of the ability to understand among_those who_live in the very_heart of certain barbarous countries , this_-isaia- largely due to the conditions under which_they exist , for since their_daily needs are so limited , they_are_not often called_upon to make_use of their intellects . You , Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons , can bear testimony to the truth of what We write , and we Ourselves can testify to these facts since We have here under Our very eyes the example of certain native students attending the colleges of Rome who not_only are equal to the other students in ability and in the results they obtain in their studies , but frequently even surpass them . Certainly you should_not allow the native clergy to be looked upon as if they_were a lower grade of priests , to be employed only in the most humble offices of the ministry . These priests have_been admitted to the same priesthood that the missionaries possess , they_are members of the selfsame apostolate . On the contrary , you_should prefer the native priests to all others , for it -isaia- they_who will one_day govern_the churches and Catholic communities founded by your sweat and labor . Therefore , there_should exist no discrimination of any_kind between priests , be they European missionaries or natives , there_must be no line of demarcation marking one off from the other . Let all priests , missionaries and natives be united with one_another in the bonds of mutual respect and love . Since it -isaia- necessary in order to organize the Church in these regions , as We have_already remarked , that_you make_use of the very elements out of which under Divine Providence they_have_been composed , you ought as a consequence to consider_the founding of religious Congregations of men_and_women made up of natives to be one of the principal duties of your holy office . Is it not meant that_these newly born followers of Christ be able to follow a life of evangelical perfection if they feel themselves called to take the vows of religion ? With reference to this_point , the missionaries and nuns who labor in your dioceses should_not permit themselves to become prejudiced out of sheer love each for his_own religious Congregation , a love_which in itself_-isaia- undoubtedly sound and legitimate . They should learn to view this_matter broadly and to act accordingly . Therefore , if there_are natives who desire to join one or other of the older Congregations , it assuredly would_not be right to dissuade them or to prevent their joining , provided , of course , they give signs of being able to acquire the spirit of these Congregations and of establishing in their_own countries houses of the Order which shall_not be unworthy of the Congregation of which_they_are members . Perhaps it would be well if you would consider seriously and without admixture of selfinterest , if it would_not be more advantageous all around to establish entirely new Congregations , which_would correspond better with the genius and character of the natives and which_would be more in keeping_with_the needs and the spirit of the different countries . We cannot pass over in silence another point most important_for the spread of the gospel , namely , the necessity of increasing the number of catechists . Catechists may be Europeans , or preferably natives , who help the missionaries in their_work especially by instructing and preparing catechumens for baptism . It -isaia- quite unnecessary to write of the qualities which these catechists should possess in order to be able to draw to Christ those who_do_not believe in Him ; this they_can do more by the example of their_lives than by word of mouth . You , Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons , make a firm resolution to train them_with all possible care in order that_they_may acquire a profound knowledge of Christian doctrine , and that in teaching the Faith they may_be_able to adapt themselves both to the natural abilities and the level of intelligence of their catechism classes . In this catechetical work their success will be in exact proportion to the intimate knowledge which_they possess of the mental ability and habits of the natives . Up to this_point We have written of the selecting and recruiting of those_who_are to share_with you your labors . There still remains for Us in this_context to commend to your zeal a plan which , if it should be put into operation , We believe would greatly help in the wider diffusion of the Faith . In what high esteem We hold the contemplative life_-isaia- made abundantly clear in the Apostolic Constitution of two years_ago , whereby We most gladly confirmed by Our Apostolic authority the rule of the Carthusians which_had_been revised to conform with the new Code of Canon Law , a rule which_had_been approved by Pontifical authority from the time of the origin of the Carthusian Order . Now , as We exhort from Our heart_the Major Superiors of similar contemplative orders , so you too in like_manner give_them repeated evidences of the fact_that they , by founding such houses in the mission field , can spread and promote the more austere types of contemplative life . These contemplatives , too , will obtain from heaven for you and for the work to which_you are devoted an abundance of graces . Nor -isaia- there any danger that_such monks will_not find conditions for their mode of life satisfactory . The inhabitants , particularly in certain places , although pagan in large majority have a natural inclination towards solitude , prayer , and contemplation . In this special connection may We call to your notice that great monastery which_the Reformed Cistercians of La Trappe founded in the Vicariate Apostolic of Peking . In this monastery there_are nearly one hundred monks , the major portion of whom are Chinese . As they , by the exercise of the most perfect virtue , by constant prayer , by the austerity of their_lives , by manual labor placate the Divine Majesty and bring down the mercies of God both upon themselves and their pagan neighbors , so also by the force of their example they win these very pagans to Jesus Christ . It -isaia- , therefore , not to be questioned that_these hermits , while they guard intact the spirit of their holy Founder and therefore do not engage in an active life , nevertheless they prove themselves of great assistance in the successful work of the missions . If , perchance , the Superiors of any of these Orders should heed your requests and establish houses for their subjects in places judged best by common agreement between you , they_shall do something which_will be , in the first_place , very beneficial to the great multitudes of pagans and which_will be , secondly , more pleasing to Us personally than_any words can express . We may now pass , Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons , to the consideration of a matter which_has to do with the better management of the missions . Although on this_subject Our immediate Predecessor has_already given his advice and instructions , We desire to repeat them here because We rightly think them to be of the utmost importance in the fruitful exercise of the apostolate . Because in great part the success of Catholic missions among the heathen depends upon you , We desire you to have a better organization of your mission work than formerly , an organization which_may serve to make easier for you in the future the work of propagation of Christian beliefs and the increase of converts to the Faith . Therefore , you_must see_to_it_that the missionaries are so distributed about_that no part of the territory assigned you shall be neglected and that no part shall be left to be evangelized -atti_degli_apostoli- some future and remote date . To accomplish this_purpose , found many new stations allowing the missionary to live in some central place in the vicinity of which_you may establish smaller houses , which_can be left in charge of -atti_degli_apostoli- least a catechist , each of which_should have a chapel so that the missionary may from time to time come on certain fixed days to visit the people and exercise his_ministry . Missionaries should remember_that in preaching to the natives they_must follow_the same methods which_the Divine Teacher used while He was on earth . Before He began to preach to the crowds , He first healed the sick : '' and all that were sick he healed ; and many followed him , and he healed them all : he had compassion on them , and healed their sick . xiv , He commanded the Apostles to do likewise and bestowed upon them the power of healing : '' And into what city so ever you enter . heal the sick that_are therein , and say to them : The Kingdom of God -isaia- come nigh unto you , '' Luke x , , and '' going out they went about through the towns , preaching the gospel , and healing everywhere . '' Luke ix , Neither should the missionary ever forget how kind and loving Jesus always showed Himself to babes and little children , or how when_the apostles remonstrated with_them , He bade them to '' suffer little children to come unto Him . xix , , Apropos of this , let Us recall what We said on another occasion , namely_,_that the missionaries who preach to the heathen know only too well how_much good_will and real affection -isaia- gained for the Church by those_who look after_the health of the natives and care_for their sick or who show a true love for their infants and children . All of which only goes to prove how readily the human_heart responds to charity and to kindness . To return to a subject which We discussed above . If it -isaia- necessary , Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons , in the cities where you_have your residences and in other more_important centers , to erect large churches and other mission buildings , you_must , however , avoid building churches or edifices that_are too sumptuous and costly as if you were erecting cathedrals and episcopal palaces for future dioceses . This type of structure will come in due time and when_the need really exists . Assuredly , you_are aware of the fact that_there exist dioceses which_have_been canonically erected , and that a long time ago , and yet only now are they constructing or have just finished the construction of churches and buildings of this_kind . Moreover , it would be neither right nor advisable to bring together , really to crowd together , in one of the principal cities or in the town where you reside the various institutions erected for the welfare of both the souls and bodies of the people . If such institutions are really large and important they_will need on the spot both your presence and that of the missionaries , and thus your visits in the interests of the propagation_of_the_faith to the remainder of the territory committed to your charge will necessarily cease . Since mention has been_made of such good_works , over and above hospitals and institutions for the care of the sick and for the distribution of medicines , and elementary schools which_you ought to open in every town , it -isaia- important_that you found other types of schools for the young_people who_do_not intend to take up agriculture , and thus by these schools open the way to them to acquiring a higher education , particularly in the arts and sciences and in the professions . We also exhort you not to neglect in this_work of education the better classes , especially_the rulers of the locality and their_children . It -isaia- beyond question that the word of God and its ministers are received more readily by the poor and humble than by the proud and rich . It -isaia-_also true_that Jesus Christ said to Himself , '' the spirit of the Lord hath sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor . '' Luke iv , Yet , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , We must_not forget what St . Paul writes : '' to the wise and unwise , I -amos- a debtor . '' Romans i , Both history and experience teach that_when once the rulers of a people_have been converted to Christianity , the common people follow closely in the footsteps of their leaders . Finally , Venerable Brothers and Beloved Sons , receive , in the wellknown spirit of zeal for religion and the salvation_of_souls which consumes you , with docile minds and with the will to obey promptly , this , Our last but most important recommendation of all . The districts confided by the Holy See to your_care and labors in order_that they too may be added to the Kingdom of Christ the Lord , are for the most part vast in extent . It may thus happen that the number of missionaries belonging to your particular Institute -isaia- much smaller than your actual needs require . In this case , just as in well established dioceses members of different religious families , priests , laymen , and nuns of many_different Congregations , are accustomed to come to the aid of the bishop , so you also , where there_-isaia- question of spreading the Faith , of educating the native youth or other similar undertakings , ought not to hesitate to invite and to receive as companions of your labors religious missionaries , even_though they be of a different Institute than your_own , and also priests or others though_they are members of lay Institutes . The Orders and Religious Congregations may well be proud of the missions given them among the heathen and of the conquests made up to the present hour for the Kingdom of Christ . Let them remember , however_,_that they_do_not possess the mission fields by a peculiar and perpetual right , but that_they hold them solely -atti_degli_apostoli- the discretion and pleasure of the Holy See which_has both the duty and the right to see_to_it_that these missions are_well and adequately taken care of . The Roman Pontiff would_not be doing his full Apostolic duty if he limited his interest solely to the distribution of missions of greater or lesser extent to one or other Institute . What -isaia- of much_more importance -isaia- that he must_always , and with_great care , see_to_it_that these different Institutes are sending into the regions confided to them as many qualified missionaries as are needed to carry on in a thorough manner the task of diffusing the light of the truth over the whole extent of these countries . Therefore , since_the Divine Pastor shall demand of Us an accounting of His Flock , We , without hesitation and whenever it shall appear to be either necessary , more opportune , or useful for the larger growth of the Catholic Church , shall transfer the mission territory of one Institute to another Institute ; We shall also divide and subdivide a mission territory and shall confide it to the care of native priests or shall assign new Vicariates and new Apostolic Prefectures of other religious Congregations than those occupying the original territory . It but remains for Us now to exhort you again , Venerable Brothers , all the bishops of the Catholic world , to share_with Us the cares and consolations of Our pastoral_office and to come to the aid of the missions in the enthusiastic manner and with the methods We have suggested in order_that the missions themselves , quickened as it were by this renewed strength , may bring forth a more abundant harvest in the future . May Mary , the Most Holy Queen of Apostles , graciously look down with favor upon this our_common undertaking ; that selfsame Mary who , since she keeps within her motherly heart all men committed to her protection on Calvary , cherishes and loves not_only those_whose fortune it -isaia- to enjoy_the fruits of the Redemption , but all those others likewise who_do_not yet know that_they_have been redeemed by Jesus Christ . In the meantime , Venerable Brothers , as a pledge of heavenly favors to come and a mark of Our fatherly love for you , We most lovingly bestow upon you , your_clergy , and your_people the Apostolic Blessing . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , the twenty eighth of February , in the year , the fifth of Our Pontificate .
