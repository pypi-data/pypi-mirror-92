Venerable Brethren , Greetings and Apostolic Benediction . Among the pleasant recollections of Our younger days are the Encyclicals which Pope Leo XIII used to write to the whole Catholic world as the month of October drew near , in order to urge the faithful to devout recitation of Mary s rosary during that month in particular . These Encyclicals had varied contents , but they_were all very wise , vibrant with fresh inspiration , and directly relevant to the practice of the Christian life . In strong and persuasive terms they exhorted Catholics to pray to God in a spirit of faith through the intercession of Mary , His Virgin Mother , by reciting the holy rosary . For the rosary -isaia- a very commendable form of prayer and meditation . In saying it we weave a mystic garland of Ave Maria s , Pater Noster s , and Gloria Patri s . And as we recite these vocal prayers , we meditate upon the principal mysteries of our religion ; the Incarnation of Jesus Christ and the Redemption of the human_race are proposed , one event after another , for our consideration . Pope John s Devotion to the Rosary . These pleasant memories of Our younger days have_not faded or vanished as the years of Our life have passed . On the contrary , We want to declare in complete frankness and simplicity that the years have_made Mary s rosary all the dearer to Us . We never fail to recite it each_day in its entirety and We intend to recite it with particular devotion during the coming month . During Our first year as pope a year which_-isaia- almost over We have several times had occasion to urge the clergy and laity to public_and_private prayer . But today We make_this same request with even greater emphasis and earnestness , for reasons which_this Encyclical will set_out very briefly . This coming October will mark the end of the first year since_the saintly departure of Our predecessor , Pius XII , from this mortal life in which_he_had distinguished himself by so many glorious achievements . Twenty days after_his death , We , though all unworthy , were raised to the Sovereign Pontificate in accord with God s mysterious designs . One pope bequeathed , as it were , to another pope , as a sacred legacy , the care of the whole Christian flock ; with the same pastoral concern each of them declared his paternal love for all mankind . These two events the one full of sorrow , the other full of joy attest clearly to the world_that while all things human gradually decline and decay , the Roman Pontificate withstands the rush of centuries , even_though the visible Heads of the Church must , one after another , leave this mortal exile as they complete the span of days which God in His providence has set for them . But all Christians should turn their thoughts to the late Pope Pius XII and to his lowly successor , in whom Blessed Peter continues his eternal mission as supreme pastor , and they_should address this_prayer to God : '' To preserve in holy religion the Pope , and all clerics in holy_orders , we beg Thee hear us . '' A Call to the Rosary . And now it -isaia- a pleasure also to recall that_this same Predecessor of Ours urged all the faithful to pious recitation of the rosary during October in the Encyclical Ingruentium malorum We would_like to repeat one admonition from that Encyclical : '' Turn in spirit with ever_greater confidence to the Virgin Mother of God , the constant refuge of Christians in adversity , since she_has been_made a source of salvation for the human_race '' . On October , , We shall_have the great pleasure of presenting mission crucifixes to a large group of Catholic missionaries who_are about to leave their beloved homes and undertake the heavy responsibility of bringing the light of Christianity to distant people . On the same day , in the afternoon , We are scheduled to visit the North American College on the Janiculum and there joyously celebrate with its superiors , faculty , and seminarians the completion of that college s first century . Although these_two celebrations fall only by coincidence on the same day , they_have the same meaning and importance : in all that she_does the Catholic Church -isaia- motivated by heaven s inspiration and drawn on by the principles and precepts of eternal truth ; all of her_children contribute with a selfless and dynamic will to mutual respect , the fraternal union of mankind , and solid peace . Hope for the Future . These young_men present such a wonderful spectacle that We must be optimistic for the future . They have overcome many obstacles and inconveniences and given themselves to God that other men might gain Christ , whether in foreign lands as yet untouched by the light of truth or in those immense , noisy , and busy cities in which_the pace of daily activity , rapid as a whirlwind , sometimes makes souls wither and become content with earthly goods . From the lips of their elders , who_have labored long in the same cause , comes the ardent prayer of the Prince of the Apostles : '' Grant to thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness . We trust that the apostolic labors of these young_men will be commended to the Virgin Mary in your devout prayers through the month of October . There -isaia- another matter also which compels Us to ask that the Sacred College of Cardinals , you , Venerable Brethren , all priests and nuns , the sick and disabled , our innocent children , and all Christians address earnest and suppliant prayers to Jesus Christ and His most loving Mother . It -isaia- this : that_those_who , in great measure , hold the future of nations in their hands consider attentively the dangerous pass to which_our age has come . Be these nations large or small , their legitimate rights and their inheritance of spiritual riches are sacred and must be safeguarded . A Prayer for Rulers . Therefore We pray God that_their rulers may carefully weigh and consider_the causes of dissension and endeavor in good faith to remove them . They must , above all , realize_that war God keep it from us ! can have only_one result , vast ruins everywhere , and thus cannot be the object of anyone s reliance . They must adapt to the needs of men of today the laws which regulate the state and society and which bind together nations and classes of society . They must be mindful of the eternal laws which come from God and are the bases and pivots of all government . Finally , they_must be ever aware_that the individual souls of men_are created by God and destined to possess and enjoy Him . It must_also be remarked that_there are current today certain schools of thought and philosophy and certain attitudes toward_the practical conduct of life which_cannot possibly be reconciled with the teachings of Christianity . This impossibility We shall never cease from asserting in firm and unambiguous , though also calm terms . But God wishes the welfare of men and of nations ! . And so We hope_that men will set_aside those sterile postulates and assumptions , hard as rock and just as inflexible , which rise from a way of thinking and acting that_-isaia- infected with laicism and materialism , and that_they_will find a complete cure in that sound doctrine which experience makes more certain with every_day that passes . We mean_that doctrine which attests that God -isaia- the author of life and its laws , that He -isaia- guarantor of the rights and dignity_of_the_human_person . God then -isaia- '' our refuge and our Redemption . '' The Coming of God s Kingdom . Our thoughts turn to all the lands of this earth . We see all mankind striving for a better future ; We see the awakening of a mysterious force , and this permits Vs to hope_that men will be drawn by a right conscience and a sense of duty to advance the real interests of human_society . That this goal may be realized in the fullest sense that_-isaia- , with the triumph of the kingdom of truth , justice , peace , and charity We exhort all Our children in Christ to be '' of one heart and one soul '' and to pour out ardent prayers in October to our Queen in heaven and our loving Mother , reflecting upon the words of the Apostle : '' In all things we suffer tribulation , but we are_not distressed ; we are sore pressed , but we are_not destitute ; we endure persecution , but we are_not forsaken ; we are cast down , but we do not perish ; always bearing about in our body the dying of Jesus , so that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodily frame . '' The Synod and the Council . Before We conclude this Encyclical We also wish to ask you , Venerable Brethren , to recite Mary s rosary through the month of October with particular devotion , and to entreat the Virgin Mother of God in suppliant prayer , for another intention which_-isaia- dear to Our heart : that the Roman Synod may bring many blessings and benefits upon this city ; that the forthcoming Ecumenical Council , in which_you will participate by your presence and your advice , will add wondrous growth to the universal Church ; and that the renewed vigor of all the Christian virtues which We hope this Council will produce will_also serve as an invitation and incentive to reunion for Our Brethren and children who_are separated_from this Apostolic See . In this fond hope , We lovingly impart the Apostolic Blessing to each_and_every one of you , Venerable Brethren , to the flocks entrusted_to_your care , and to those individuals especially who_will respond to Our entreaties in a devout and zealous spirit .
