LEO I : THE SEE OF PETER AS THE CENTER OF CHRISTIAN UNITY NOVEMBER , To the Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs , Primates , Archbishops , Bishops , and other Local Ordinaries in Peace and Communion with the Apostolic See : Commemorating the fifteenth centenary of the death of St . Leo the Great , Pope and Doctor of the Church . Venerable Brethren Health and Apostolic Benediction God s eternal wisdom '' reacheth from end to end mightily and ordereth all things sweetly . '' Its light shone with exceptional brilliance in the soul of Pope St . Leo I , for it would seem to have burned into it the very image of itself ; so fearless the moral courage displayed by this Pope '' the greatest among the great , '' as Our later predecessor Pius XII rightly called him yet so gentle his fatherly concern . The wisdom of his government , the wealth and scope of his_teaching , the loftiness of his mind , his unfailing charity these_are the things_which St . Leo the Great brought to enhance the fame of Peter s See , to which Almighty God in His providence has_also raised Us . And now , on this fifteenth centenary of his_death , We feel it incumbent upon Us to highlight his virtues and his immortal merits , confident that_these can be of great spiritual value to us all , and increase the prestige and promote the spread of the Catholic Faith . Life long Brilliance . Wherein , then , lies the true greatness of this Pope ? In moral courage ? in that moral courage which he showed when , -atti_degli_apostoli- the River Mincius in , with no other armor to protect him than his high priestly majesty , he boldly confronted the barbarous king of the Huns , Attila , and persuaded him to retreat with_his armies across the Danube ? That was certainly an heroic act and one_which accorded well with the Roman pontificate s mission of peace . Yet we must think of it as but_one isolated instance of a life long activity of remarkable brilliance devoted to the religious and social welfare , not merely of Rome and of Italy , but of the whole Church throughout_the_world . '' The Path of the Just . '' The path of the just , as a shining light , goeth forwards and increaseth even to perfect day . '' These words of Holy Scripture may well be applied to the life and activity of St . To be convinced of this we have but to consider St . Leo in his three main characteristic roles : as a man singularly dedicated to the service of the Apostolic See , as Christ s chief Vicar on earth , and as Doctor of the universal Church . FAITHFUL SERVANT OF THE APOSTOLIC SEE . Leo was_born toward_the end of the fourth century . The Liber Pontificalis informs us that he was '' of Tuscan nationality from his_father Quintian . '' Since , however , he spent his early years in Rome , he not unnaturally called this city his patria homeland . While still a young_man he joined the ranks of the Roman clergy and in due course was ordained deacon . In this capacity he rendered signal service to Pope Sixtus III between_the years and , and played a considerable part in the conduct of Church affairs . Among the many friends he made -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time were St . Prosper , bishop of Aquitania , and Cassian , founder of the celebrated Abbey of St . Cassian , whom he persuaded to write De Incarnatione Domini against the Nestorians , proclaimed him '' the glory of the Church and the sacred_ministry '' praise indeed for a simple deacon ! Theologian and Diplomat . At the request of the court of Ravenna the Pope sent St . Leo to Gaul to settle a dispute between_the patrician Aetius and the prefect Albinus . It was while Leo was engaged on this_mission that Sixtus III died . Recognizing Leo s unrivalled theological learning and practical wisdom in diplomacy and the conduct of affairs , the Roman Church could think of no more worthy candidate for Christ s vicarious power on earth than_this deacon . A Most Illustrious Pope . Hence on September th , , he was consecrated bishop and entered upon his sovereign pontificate . He discharged this office with_such masterly ability that he must be reckoned among the most illustrious of the early popes , few of whom reigned longer than he . He died in November , , and was buried in the porch of the Vatican Church . Sergius I , his_body was removed to '' Peter s Citadel '' and later , on the building of the new basilica , found a resting place in the altar dedicated to his_name . CHRIST S VICAR ON EARTH . What then were_the more notable achievements of his_life ? To this_question We would reply that rarely in her history has Christ s Church won such victories over her foes as in the pontificate of Leo the Great . He shone in the middle of the fifth century like a brilliant star in the Christian firmament . The Pelagian and Nestorian Heresies . To be convinced of this we have but to consider_the way_in_which he discharged his office as teacher of the Catholic Faith . In this_field he won for_himself a name equal to that of St . Augustine of Hippo and St . Augustine , as we know , in defending the Faith against the Pelagians , insisted on the absolute necessity of divine_grace for right living and the attainment of eternal_salvation . Cyril , faced_with the errors of Nestorius , upheld Christ s Divinity and the fact_that the Virgin Mary -isaia- truly the Mother of God . These truths lie -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of our Catholic Faith , and St . Leo , who entered into the doctrinal inheritance of both these_men of learning , the brightest luminaries of the Eastern and Western Church , was among all his contemporaries by far the most fearless protagonist of them . Defender of Church Unity . Augustine , then , -isaia- celebrated in the universal Church as '' Doctor of divine_grace , '' and St . Cyril as '' Doctor of the Incarnate Word . '' ; By the same token St . Leo -isaia- universally proclaimed as '' Doctor of the Church s unity . For the integrity of doctrine was_not his_only concern . We have but to cast a cursory glance over the great volume of evidence of his amazing industry as pastor and writer to realize_that he was equally concerned_with the upholding of moral standards and the defense of the Church s unity . Consider , too , the field of liturgical composition and the due regard which_this religious and saintly Pope had for the unity of worship . Many of the principal prayers contained in the Leonine Sacramentary were either written by him or modelled on his compositions . On the Incarnation : His Letter to Flavian . Most noteworthy , perhaps , -isaia-_his timely and authoritative intervention in the controversy as to whether there_was in Jesus Christ a human_nature in addition to the divine nature . His efforts were responsible_for the magnificent triumph of the true doctrine concerning the incarnation of the Word of God . This fact alone would assure him his place in history . Our principal evidence for it -isaia-_his Epistle to Flavian , Bishop of Constantinople , in which he expounds the dogma of the Incarnation with remarkable clarity and precision , showing how it accords with the teaching of the Prophets , the Gospel , the apostolic writings , and the Creed . Let Us quote a significant passage from this Epistle : '' Without detriment , therefore , to the properties of either of the two natures and substances which_are joined in the one person , majesty took on humility ; strength , weakness ; eternity , mortality ; and , in order to pay off the debt which attached to our condition , inviolable nature was united with passible nature , so that , as suited the cure of our ills , one_and_the_same Mediator between God and men , the Man Jesus Christ , could die with the one nature and not die with the other . Thus true God was_born in the whole and perfect nature of true man ; complete in what_was His own , complete in what_was ours . '' Condemnation of Ephesine Council . Not content with this , St . Leo , having made perfectly clear '' what_the Catholic Church universally believes and teaches concerning the mystery of the Lord s incarnation , '' followed up this Epistle to Flavian with a condemnation of the Ephesine Council of . At this council the supporters of Eutyches had , by violent and unconstitutional means , done all they could to impose the groundless dogmatic assertions of this '' very foolish and exceedingly ignorant man , '' who obstinately maintained that_there was only_one nature in Christ , the divine nature . The Pope , with evident justification , branded this '' a robber council . '' In violation of the express commands of the Apostolic See , it had presumed by every_means -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposal to arrogate to itself no less a task than '' the breaking down of the Catholic Faith '' and '' the strengthening of execrable heresy . '' The Council of Chalcedon . Leo s principal title to fame -isaia- the Council of Chalcedon , held in . In spite of pressure from the Emperor Marcian , the Pope refused to allow it to be summoned except on condition that_his own legates should preside over it . It proved , Venerable Brethren , to be one of the greatest events in the history of the Church , renowned alike for its solemn definition of the doctrine of the two natures in God s Incarnate Word , and its recognition of the magisterial primacy of the Roman Pontiff . We need not , however , enter_into any more detailed discussion of it here , for Our predecessor Pius XII has_already dealt_with it in an important Encyclical addressed to the entire Catholic world on the fifteenth centenary of its convocation . The Twenty Eighth Canon . Leo s delay in ratifying the acts of this council -isaia- further proof of his genuine concern_for the Church s unity and peace . We cannot attribute this delay to any remissness on his part , or to any cause of a doctrinal character . Obviously his intention as he himself explains was to thwart the twenty eighth canon , which voiced the agreement of the Fathers of the council to the primacy of the See of Constantinople over all the churches of the East . Whether or not this canon was inserted in defiance of the protests of the papal legates , or to win the favor of the Byzantine Emperor , -isaia- not clear . Leo , it appeared to undermine the prerogatives of other more ancient and more illustrious churches , prerogatives which_had_been recognized by the Fathers of the Council of Nicea . He also saw it as detracting somewhat from the authority of the Apostolic See itself . His misgivings were occasioned not_so_much by the wording of the twenty eighth canon as by the policies of those_who framed it . Two letters illustrate this_point : one sent by the bishops of the council , and the other written by Leo himself in refutation of their arguments and sent to the Emperor Marcian . This letter contains the following admonition : . '' Things secular stand on a different basis from things divine , and there_can be no sure building save on that rock which_the Lord has set as the foundation Matt . He who covets what_-isaia- not his due , loses what_-isaia- rightfully his . The sad history of the schism that_was later to separate so many illustrious Eastern churches from the church of Rome bears striking testimony to the accuracy of St . Leo s prophetic vision , here expressed , and to his presentiment of the future disruption of Christian unity . Toward Full Catholic Unity . To complete this account We would mention in passing two further instances of St . Leo s unfailing solicitude for the defense of the Catholic Church s unity : his intervention in the dispute concerning the date of Easter , and his great efforts to create an atmosphere of mutual respect , trust and cordiality in the Holy See s public relations with Christian princes . To see the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- peace was_the dearest desire of his_heart . He frequently prevailed upon these princes to join forces with the bishops and lend them the support of their counsels '' for the concord of Catholic unity , '' so as to win from Almighty God '' a priestly palm , besides a kingly crown . '' DOCTOR OF THE CHURCH . Besides being a watchful shepherd of Christ s flock and a stout hearted defender of the true faith , St . Leo -isaia- honored also as a Doctor of the Church , one , that_-isaia- , who excelled in expounding and sponsoring those divine truths_which every Roman Pontiff safeguards and proclaims . Pope Benedict s Eulogy . In support of this We quote that magnificent eulogy of St . Leo written by Pope Benedict XIV in his Apostolic Constitution Militantis Ecclesiae , October th , when he made him a Doctor of the Church : . '' It was due to his excelling virtue , his_teaching , and his_most vigilant zeal as shepherd of his_people , that he won from our forefathers the title Great . In expounding the deeper mysteries of our_faith and vindicating it against the errors that assail it , in imparting disciplinary rules and moral precepts , the excellence of his teaching_-isaia- so radiant with the majestic richness of priestly eloquence and has so won the admiration of the world and the enthusiasm alike of Councils , Fathers and writers of the Church , that the fame and reputation of this wisest of popes can hardly be rivalled by any_other of the Church s holy doctors . It -isaia- through_his many extant Sermons and Epistles that he principally lays claim to the title of Doctor . The Sermons cover a great variety of subjects , nearly all of which_have some connection_with the liturgical cycle . In all these writings he -isaia- not_just the exegete elucidating a Book of Sacred Scripture , not_just the theologian -atti_degli_apostoli- pains to investigate some divinely revealed_truth . He -isaia- the saintly exponent of the Christian mysteries . He explains them_with clarity and with a wealth of detail , in accordance_with_the faith of the councils , the Fathers , and the popes who preceded him . His style -isaia- simple , majestic , lofty , persuasive , a model of classic eloquence . But in declaring the truth he never sacrificed precision to mere rhetoric . He did_not speak or write to be admired , but to enlighten the minds of his hearers , and to awaken in them the desire to live lives in conformity_with_the truths they professed . The Epistles are the letters he wrote as Sovereign Pontiff to the princes , priests , deacons and religious of the universal Church . They display his exceptional qualities of leadership . They show him as a man of keen intellect , yet full of practical good sense ; a man of character who kept to his decisions , yet a father most ready to forgive ; on fire with charity_which St . Paul indicated to all Christians as '' a more excellent way . For that blend of justice and mercy , of strength and gentleness , which we observe in his character -isaia- surely attributable to that_same charity_which Jesus Christ demanded of Peter when He made him a shepherd to feed His lambs and His sheep . Leo s life long endeavor was to appear before the world in the character of Christ , the Good Shepherd . In evidence of this , We may quote the following passage from the Epistles : . '' We are encompassed by both the gentleness of mercy and the strictness of justice . And because all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth Ps . : , We are forced according to Our loyalty to the Apostolic See so to moderate Our opinions as to weigh men s misdeeds in the balance for , of course , they_are_not all of one measure , and to reckon some as to a certain degree pardonable , but others as altogether reprehensible . '' Devotion to Truth , Harmony , Peace . All in all , these Epistles and Sermons are an eloquent testimony to St . Leo s passionate devotion , in thought and feeling , word and action , to the welfare of the Catholic Church and the cause of truth , harmony and peace . THE SECOND VATICAN COUNCIL AND UNITY . Venerable Brethren , the time -isaia- drawing near for the Second General Council of the Vatican . Surrounding the Roman Pontiff and in close communion with_him , you , the Bishops , will present to the world a wonderful spectacle of Catholic unity . Meanwhile We , for Our part , will seek to give instruction and comfort by briefly recalling to mind St . Leo s high ideals regarding the Church s unity . Our intention in so doing -isaia- indeed to honor the memory of a most wise Pope , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time to give the faithful profitable food for thought on the eve of this_great event . Church Unity in the Thought of Leo . Leo teaches_that the Church must be one because Jesus Christ , her Bridegroom , -isaia- one . '' For the Church -isaia- that virgin , the spouse of one husband , Christ , who_does_not allow herself to be corrupted by any error . Thus throughout_the whole_world we are to have one entire and pure communion . Leo s view , this remarkable unity of the Church has its well spring in the birth of God s Incarnate Word . '' For Christ s birth -isaia-_the_source of life_for Christian people ; the birthday of the Head -isaia- the birthday of the Body . Although every_individual -isaia- called in his_own turn , and all the Church s sons are separated_from one_another by intervals of time , yet the entire body of the faithful , born in the baptismal font , -isaia- born with Christ in His nativity , just as all are crucified with Him in His passion , raised again in His resurrection , and set -atti_degli_apostoli- the Father s right hand in His ascension . It was Mary who participated most intimately in this secret birth '' of the body , the Church , '' because the Holy Spirit gave fruitfulness to her virginity . Leo praises Mary as '' the Lord s virgin , handmaid and mother , '' '' she_who gave God birth '' Dei genitrix , sea virgin for ever . Furthermore , the sacrament of Baptism as St . Leo rightly claims makes those_who_are washed in the sacred font not_only members of Christ , but_also sharers in His kingship and His priesthood . '' All those_who_are reborn in Christ , the sign of the cross makes kings ; the Holy Spirit s anointing consecrates them priests . Leo '' sanctification by chrism , '' strengthens their assimilation to Jesus Christ , the Head of His body , the Church , and the sacrament of the Eucharist perfects this union . Leo says , '' the reception of Christ s Body and Blood does nothing less_than transform us into that_which we consume , and henceforth we bear in soul and body Him in whose fellowship we died , were buried , and are risen again . But mark this well : unless the faithful remain bound together by the same ties of virtue , worship and sacrament , and all hold fast to the same belief , they_cannot be perfectly united with the Divine Redeemer , the universal Head , so as to form with Him one visible and living body . '' A whole faith , '' says St . Leo , '' a true faith , -isaia- a mighty bulwark . No one_can add anything to it , no one_can take anything away from it ; for unless it -isaia- one , it -isaia- no faith -atti_degli_apostoli- all . To preserve this_unity of faith , all teachers of divine truths all bishops , that_-isaia- must necessarily speak with one mind and one voice , in communion with the Roman Pontiff . '' It -isaia- the union of members in the body as a whole which_makes all alike healthy , all alike beautiful , and this union of the whole_body requires unanimity . It calls especially_for harmony among the priests . They have a common dignity , yet they_have not uniform rank , for there_was a distinction of power even among the blessed apostles , notwithstanding the similarity of their honorable state , and while the election of them all was equal , yet it was_given to one to take the lead over the rest . '' The Bishop of Rome , Center of Visible Unity . Leo , therefore , maintained that the Bishop of Rome , as Peter s successor and Christ s Vicar on earth , -isaia- the focal center of the entire visible unity of the Catholic Church . Leo s opinion -isaia- clearly supported by the evidence of the Gospels and by ancient Catholic tradition , as these_words show : '' Out of the whole_world one man_-isaia- chosen , Peter . He -isaia- set before all the elect of every nation , before all the apostles and all the Fathers of the Church ; so that although there_are among God s people many priests and many pastors , Peter governs by personal commission all whom Christ rules by His supreme_authority . Great and wonderful , beloved , -isaia- the share in its_own power which_the Divine Condescension assigned to this man . And if it desired other princes to share anything in common with_him , never except through_him did it accord what it did_not deny to others . Leo regarded this indissoluble bond_between Peter s divinely given authority and that of the other apostles as fundamental to Catholic unity , he was never tired of insisting that '' this authority to bind and to loose was_also passed on to the other apostles , and what_was established by this decree found its way to all the princes of the Church . But there_was good_reason for committing what_was intended for all to the care of one in particular . And so it was entrusted to Peter individually because the figure of Peter was to be put ahead of all those in charge of the Church . '' The Magisterial Prerogative of St . Peter and His Successors . There -isaia- , moreover , another essential safeguard of the Church s visible unity_which did_not escape that notice of this saintly Pope : that supreme_authority to teach infallibly , which Christ gave personally to Peter , the prince of the apostles , and to his_successors . Leo s words are quite unequivocal : '' The Lord takes special_care of Peter ; He prays especially_for Peter s faith , for the state of the rest will be more secure if the mind of their chief be not overthrown . Hence the strength of all the rest -isaia- made stronger in Peter , and the assistance of divine_grace -isaia- so ordained that the stability which through Christ -isaia- given to Peter , should through Peter be transmitted to the other apostles . Peter this pronouncement -isaia- clear and emphatic enough ; yet unhesitatingly St . Leo claims the same prerogative for_himself . Not that he wanted worldly honor , but he had no doubt whatever that he was just as much Christ s vicar as was_the Prince of the Apostles . Consider , for example , this passage from his Sermons : . '' Mindful , then of Our God given responsibility , We find no reason_for pride in solemnly celebrating the anniversary of Our priesthood , for we acknowledge with all sincerity and truth that_it_-isaia- Christ who_does the work of Our ministry in all that We do rightly . We do not glory in Ourselves , for without Him We can do nothing . We glory in Him who_-isaia- all Our power . By that he did_not mean_that St . Peter had no further influence on the government of Christ s Church . While he trusted in the continued activity of the Church s Divine Founder , he trusted too in the protection of the Apostle Peter whose heir and successor he claimed to be , and whose office of authority '' he in his turn discharged . '' He attributed the success of his universal ministry more to the merits of the Apostle than to his_own industry . Many passages from his writings might be quoted in support of this statement . We chose the following : . '' And so if anything -isaia- rightly done and rightly decreed by Us , if anything -isaia- won from the mercy of God by Our daily supplications , it -isaia- due to his Peter s works and merits , whose power lives and whose authority prevails in his See . Nor must we think_that St . Leo was preaching a doctrine that had never before been taught . For , that_his supreme office as universal pastor came from Christ Himself was_also the teaching of his predecessors St . Boniface I , and was in full accord with_those passages of the Gospels which he so often expounded Matt . He frequently referred to '' the care which , principally by divine mandate , We must_have for all the churches . '' The Spiritual Greatness of Rome . Small wonder then that St . Leo habitually combines the praises of Rome with_those of the Prince of the Apostles . He begins one of his Sermons on the Apostles Peter and Paul by apostrophizing the City in these_words : . '' It was through these_men , O Rome , that the light of Christ s gospel shone upon you . It was they_who promoted you to such glory , making you a holy nation , a chosen people , a priestly and royal state , the capital of the world through Peter s holy See . By the worship of God you gained a wider empire than you did by earthly government . For although your boundaries were extended by your many victories and you stretched your rule over land and ocean , yet your labors in war gained you less subjects than have_been won for you by the peace of Christ . Paul s magnificent testimony to the faith of the first Christians in Rome , this_great Pope bids the Romans preserve the faith whole and entire and without flaw . These are the words of fatherly encouragement he uses : . '' You , therefore , beloved of God and honored by apostolic approval for it -isaia- to you that the teacher of the Gentiles , the blessed Apostle Paul , says : Your faith_-isaia- spoken of in the whole_world Rom . : preserve in yourselves that_which you_know to have_been the cause of this_great preacher s good opinion of you . Let not a man of you make himself undeserving of this praise , or allow so much as a taint of Eutyches impious doctrine to infect a people that_has remained for so long untouched by heresy , taught by the Holy Spirit . '' The Vast Influence of St . Leo s heroic efforts to safeguard the authority of the Church of Rome were_not in vain . It was principally due to his personal prestige that '' the citadel of the apostolic rock '' was extolled and venerated not_only by the Western bishops_who took part in the councils held -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , but by more_than five hundred Eastern bishops assembled -atti_degli_apostoli- Chalcedon , and even by the Byzantine emperors . We might also quote that magnificent tribute paid by Theodoret , Bishop of Cyrus , to the Roman Bishop and his privileged flock . Writing in , before the famous Council of Chalcedon , Theodoret says : . '' It -isaia- fitting_that you_should in all things have_the pre eminence , in view of the many peculiar privileges possessed by your See . Other cities are distinguished for their size or beauty or population . but your city has the greatest abundance of good things from the Giver of all good . k -isaia- of all cities the greatest and most famous , the mistress of the world and teeming with population . It has , too , the tombs of our_common fathers and teachers of the Truth , Peter and Paul , to illumine the souls of the faithful . These two saintly men did indeed have_their rising in the East , but_they shed their light in all directions , and voluntarily underwent the sunset of life in the West , from whence now they illumine the whole_world . It -isaia- they_who have_made your See so glorious . This -isaia- the foremost of all your goods . Their See -isaia- still blessed by the light of God s presence , for He has placed Your Holiness in it to shed abroad the rays of the one true Faith . Nor did these great honors paid to Leo by the official representatives of the Eastern Churches terminate with his_death . The Byzantine liturgy keeps the th of February as his feast day , and most truly proclaims him as '' leader of orthodoxy , teacher renowned for his_holiness and majesty , star of the world , glory and light of Christians , lyre of the Holy Spirit . The Gelasian Menology reechoes these praises : '' As bishop of great Rome , this father of ours , Leo , whom we admire for his self mastery and purity and his many_other virtues , gained by these virtues many notable achievements , but his_most brilliant achievements are those_which concern the true Faith . Our purpose , Venerable Brethren , in focusing attention on these facts has_been to establish beyond doubt_that in ancient times East and West alike were united in the generosity of their tribute to the holiness of St . Leo the Great . Would that it were so today ; that_those_who are separated_from the Church of Rome yet still have_the welfare of the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , might bear_witness once_more to that ancient , universal esteem_for St . For if only they_will settle their differences those lamentable differences concerning the teaching and pastoral_activity of this_great Pope then the Faith in which_they believe will shine_forth with renewed splendor ; namely_,_that '' there_-isaia-_one God , and one mediator of God and men , the man Christ Jesus . '' Universality of Christ s Command . Leo s successor in Peter s See of Rome . We share in Peter s See of Rome . We share his firm belief in the divine origin of that command which Jesus Christ gave to the apostles and their successors to preach_the_gospel and bring eternal_salvation to the whole_world . Leo s desire to see all men enter_the way of truth , charity and peace . It -isaia- to render the Church better able to fulfill this high mission of hers that We have resolved to summon the Second General Council of the Vatican . We are fully confident that_this solemn assembly of the Catholic Hierarchy will not_only reinforce that_unity in faith , worship and discipline which_-isaia- a distinguishing mark of Christ s true Church , but will_also attract the gaze of the great majority of Christians of every denomination , and induce them to gather around '' the great Pastor of the sheep '' who entrusted His flock to the unfailing guardianship of Peter and his_successors . Our fervent appeal for_unity -isaia- intended , therefore , to be the echo of that_which was_made many times by St . Leo in the fifth century . We wish , too , to make Our own those words_which St . Irenaeus addressed to the faithful of all the churches , when God s Providence called him from Asia to rule_the See of Lyons and confer on it the fame of his martyrdom . Recognizing that the Bishops of Rome were heirs to that power which_had_been handed_down in uninterrupted succession from the two Princes of the Apostles , he went on to address the following appeal to all Christians : . '' For with this church , by reason of its pre eminent superiority , all the churches that_-isaia- , all Christians everywhere must be united ; and it -isaia- through communion with it that all these faithful or those_who preside over the churches have preserved the apostolic tradition . '' That All May Be One . But out greatest desire -isaia- that_this Our call to unity shall re echo the Saviour s prayer to His Father -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper : '' That they all may be one , as thou , Father , in men , and I in thee ; that_they also may be one in Us . Are we to say that this_prayer went unheeded by the heavenly Father , who yet accepted the sacrifice of Christ s blood on the Cross ? Did not Christ say that His Father never failed to hear Him ? He prayed for the Church ; He sacrificed Himself on the Cross for it , and promised it His unfailing presence . Assuredly , then , we must believe_that this Church has_always_been , and still -isaia- , one , holy , catholic and apostolic ; for thus was it founded . Some Hopeful Signs . Unfortunately , however , the sort of unity whereby all believers in Christ profess the same faith , practise the same worship and obey the same supreme_authority , -isaia- no more evident among the Christians of today than it was in bygone ages . We do , however , see more_and_more men_of_good will in various parts_of_the_world earnestly striving to bring_about this visible unity among Christians , a unity_which truly accords with the Divine Saviour s intentions , commands and desires ; and this to Us -isaia- a source of joyous consolation and ineffable hope . This desire_for unity , We know , -isaia- fostered in them by the Holy Spirit , and it can_only be realized in the way_in_which Jesus Christ has prophesied it : '' There will be one fold and one shepherd . '' Day of Peace and Reconciliation . We therefore beg and implore Christ Our Mediator and Advocate with the Father to give all Christians the grace to recognize those marks by which His true Church -isaia- distinguished from all others , and to become its devoted sons . May God in His infinite kindness hasten the dawn of that long awaited day of joyful , universal reconciliation . Then will all Christ s redeemed , united in a single family , join in praising the divine Mercy , singing in joyous harmony those words of the psalmist of old : '' Behold , how good and how pleasant it -isaia- for brethren to dwell together in unity '' . That day_of_peace and reconciliation between sons of the same heavenly Father and coheirs of the same eternal happiness , will indeed be a day of triumph for the Mystical Body of Jesus Christ . Venerable Brethren , the fifteenth centenary of the death of St . Leo the Great finds the Catholic Church in much the same plight as she_was -atti_degli_apostoli- the turn of the fifth century . The same waves of bitter hostility break upon her . How many violent storms does she not enter in these_days of ours storms which trouble Our fatherly heart , even_though our Divine Redeemer clearly forewarned us of them ! . On every side We see '' the faith of the gospel '' imperilled . In some quarters an attempt -isaia- being made usually to no avail to induce bishops_,_priests and faithful to withdraw their allegiance from this See of Rome , the stronghold of Catholic unity . Leo s Patronage Invoked . To rid the Church of these dangers We confidently invoke the patronage of that_most vigilant of Popes who labored and wrote and suffered so much for the cause of Catholic unity . To those of you who_suffer patiently in the cause of truth and justice , We speak the consoling words_which St . Leo once addressed to the clergy , public officials and people of Constantinople : '' Be steadfast , therefore , in the spirit of Catholic truth , and receive apostolic_exhortation through Our ministry . For unto you it -isaia- given for Christ , not_only to believe in him , but_also to suffer for him Phil . We pray , too , for those of you_who have_the security and stability of Catholic unity . Unworthy as We are , We are nonetheless the Divine Redeemer s Vicar , and Our prayer_for you -isaia-_the_same as that_which Christ prayed to the heavenly Father for His own beloved disciples and for those_who would believe in Him : '' Holy Father . that_they_may be made perfect in one . '' Charity , the Bond . That perfection and consummation of unity_which We most earnestly beg God to grant to all the Church s sons , can be achieved only through charity . For charity_-isaia- '' the bond of perfection . '' It -isaia- charity alone that makes it possible_for us to love God above all else , and makes us ready and glad to do all the good we can to others in a spirit of generosity . It -isaia- charity alone which_makes '' the temple of the living God '' , the holy Church , and all her sons throughout_the_world , radiant with supernatural beauty . Perfect in the Whole , Perfect in the Individual . These sons of the Church , therefore , We counsel once_more in the words of St . Leo : '' The faithful , wholly and singly , are God s temple ; and just as His temple -isaia- perfect in the whole , so must it be perfect in the individual . For although all the members are_not equally beautiful , nor_can there be parity of merits in so great a variety of parts , nevertheless the bond of charity makes them all alike sharers in the beauty of the whole . For they_are all united in the fellowship of holy love , and though they_do_not all make_use of the same gifts of grace , they nevertheless rejoice with one_another in the good things_which are theirs . Nor can the object of their love be anything which bears no relation to themselves , for in the very_fact of rejoicing in another s progress they_are enriched by their_own growth . '' Around a Single Standard . We cannot end this Encyclical , Venerable Brethren , without referring once_more to Our own and St . Leo s most ardent longing : to see the whole company of the redeemed in Jesus Christ s precious blood reunited around_the single standard of the militant Church . Then let_the battle commence in earnest , as we strive with might and main to resist the adversary s assaults who in so many parts_of_the_world -isaia- threatening to annihilate our Christian faith . '' Then are God s people strongest , '' said St . Leo , '' when_the hearts of all the faithful unite in one common act of holy obedience ; when in the camp of the Christian army the same preparation -isaia- made on all sides for the fight and for defence , '' . For in the Church of Christ , if love_-isaia- queen , no prince of darkness can prevail . '' The devil s works are then most effectually destroyed when men s hearts are reunited in the love of God and the love of one_another . In furtherance of this expectation , Venerable Brethren , We lovingly impart to each_and_every one of you , and to the flocks committed to your watchful care , that earnest of the blessings of heaven , Our Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the eleventh day of November in the year , the fourth of Our Pontificate .
