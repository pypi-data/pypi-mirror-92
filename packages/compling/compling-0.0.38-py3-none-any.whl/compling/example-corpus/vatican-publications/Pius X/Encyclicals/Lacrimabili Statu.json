Being greatly moved by the deplorable condition of the Indians in Lower America , our illustrious predecessor Benedict XIV pleaded their cause , as you_are aware , in most weighty words , in his letter Immensa Pastorum , given on December , ; and since we also have to deplore in many places almost the same things_that he then lamented , we most earnestly recall those letters of his to your memory . For therein , among other_things , Pope Benedict complained that although the Apostolic See had done much , and for a long time , to relieve their afflicted fortunes , there_were even the '' men of the orthodox faith who , as if they_had utterly forgotten all sense of the charity poured forth in our_hearts by the Holy Ghost , presumed to reduce the wretched Indians , without_the light_of_faith , and even_those who had_been washed in the laver of regeneration , to servitude , or to sell them as slaves to others , or to deprive them of their property , and to treat them_with such inhumanity that_they were thus greatly hindered from embracing the Christian faith , and most strongly moved to regard it with abhorrence . '' It -isaia- true_that soon afterwards the worst of these indignities that_-isaia- to say , slavery , properly so called was , by the goodness of the merciful God , abolished ; and to this public abolition of slavery in Brazil and in other regions the excellent men_who governed those Republics were greatly moved and encouraged by the maternal care and insistence of the Church . And we gladly acknowledge that if it had not_been for_many and great obstacles that stood in the way , their plans would_have had far greater success . Nevertheless , though much has thus been done for the Indians , there_-isaia- much_more that still remains to be done . And , indeed , when we consider_the crimes and outrages still committed against them , our heart_-isaia- filled_with horror , and we are moved to great compassion for its most unhappy race . For what can be so cruel and so barbarous as to scourge men and brand them_with hot iron , often for most trivial causes , often for a mere lust of cruelty ; or , having suddenly overthrown them , to slay hundreds or thousands in one unceasing massacre ; or to waste villages and districts and slaughter the inhabitants , so that_some tribes , as we understand , have_become extinct in these last few years ? . The lust of lucre has done much to make_the minds_of_men so barbarous . But something also -isaia- due to the nature of the climate and the situation of these regions . For , as these places are subjected to burning southern sun , which casts a languor into the veins and as it were , destroys the vigor of virtue , and as they_are far removed from the habits of religion and the vigilance of the State , and in a measure even from civil_society , it easily comes to pass that_those_who have_not already come there with evil morals soon begin to be corrupted , and then , when all bonds of right and duty are broken , they fall away into all hateful vices . Nor in this do they take any pity on the weakness of sex or age , so that_we_are ashamed to mention the crimes and outrages they commit in seeking out and selling women and children , wherein it may be truly said that_they_have surpassed the worst examples of pagan iniquity . For our part , indeed , when reports of these_things were first brought to us , we hesitated for some time to give credence to such atrocities , since_they certainly seemed to be incredible . But after we had_been assured by abundant witnesses to wit , by many of yourselves , Venerable Brethren , by the Delegates of the Apostolic See , by the missioners , and by other men wholly worthy of belief we can no longer have any doubt as to the truth of these statements . Now , therefore , having pondered long on this_matter , so that , as far as lies in our power , we may endeavor to remedy such_great evils , with humble and suppliant prayer we beg of God that He may deign in His goodness to show us some opportune way of healing these wounds . For He Himself , Who -isaia-_the_most loving Maker and Redeemer of all mankind , since He has_given us this desire of laboring for the saving of the Indians , will_also assuredly give us those_things that conduce to this_end . Meanwhile , it greatly consoles us to know that_those_who bear rule in these Republics are making every endeavor to remove this outstanding disgrace and this stain from their States ; which endeavors , indeed , we cannot sufficiently praise and approve . Since , however , these regions are far from the seats of Government , and are for the most part not readily accessible , these human endeavors of the civil powers , whether from the craft of the criminals , who_can speedily cross the frontiers , or through the inactivity or perfidy of the officials , often do little good , and sometimes come to nothing . But if the work of the Church -isaia- added to the work of the State , then -atti_degli_apostoli- length the desired fruit shall be obtained in greater abundance . Wherefore , Venerable Brethren , we call_upon you , before all others , to give special_care and thought to this cause , which_-isaia- in every way worthy of your pastoral_office and duty . And leaving the rest to your solicitude and diligence , we particularly urge you to foster and promote all the good_works instituted in your dioceses for the benefit of the Indians , and to see_that other works likely to contribute to this_end may be instituted . In the next place you will diligently admonish your flocks on their most_sacred duty of helping religious missions to the natives who first inhabited the American soil . Let them know_that they ought to help this_work especially in two ways , to wit , by their gifts and by their prayers ; and that it -isaia-_not_only their religion , but their_country also , that asks this of them . Do you , moreover , take_care that wheresoever moral instruction -isaia- given , in seminaries , in colleges , in convent schools , and more especially in the churches , Christian charity , which holds all men , without distinction of nation or color , as true brethren , shall be continually preached and commended . And this charity must be made manifest not_so_much by words as by deeds . Moreover , every opportunity must_be_taken to show what a great dishonor -isaia- done to the Christian name by these base deeds , which_we_are here denouncing . As for our part , having good_reason to hope_for the consent and support of the public_authorities , we have more especially taken care to extend the field of Apostolic labor in these broad regions , appointing further missionary stations , where_the Indians can_find safety and succor . For the Catholic Church has_ever been a fertile mother of Apostolic men , who , pressed by the charity of Christ , are brought to give their_lives for their brethren . And today , when so many abhor the faith or fall away from it , the zeal for spreading the Gospel among the barbarous nations -isaia- still strong in the clergy and in religious men and holy virgins ; and this zeal grows greater and -isaia- spread abroad more widely by the power of the Holy Ghost , who helps the Church , His spouse , according to the needs of the time . Wherefore , we think it well to make greater use of those aids which by God s goodness are ready to our hand , in order to deliver the Indians , where their need -isaia- greatest . from the slavery of Satan and of wicked men . For the rest , since_the preachers of the Gospel had watered these regions , not_only with_their sweat , but sometimes with_their blood , we trust that -atti_degli_apostoli- length a fair harvest of Christian kindness shall spring forth_from their great labors and bear abundant fruit . And now , in order_that what_you shall do for the benefit of the Indians , whether of your_own accord or -atti_degli_apostoli- our exhortation , may be the more efficacious by the help of our Apostolic authority , we , mindful of the example of our aforesaid predecessor , condemn and declare guilty of grave crime whosoever , as he says , '' shall dare or presume to reduce the said Indians to slavery , to sell them , to buy them , to exchange or give_them , to separate them_from their wives and children , to deprive them of goods and chattels , to transport or send them to other places , or in any_way whatsoever to rob them of freedom and hold them in slavery ; or to give counsel , help , favor , and work on any pretext of color to them that do these_things , or to preach or teach that_it_-isaia- lawful , or to co operate therewith in any_way whatever . '' Accordingly , we will that the power of absolving penitents in the sacramental tribunal from_these crimes shall be reserved to ordinaries of the localities . It has seemed well to us , moved by our_paternal affection and following the footsteps of your predecessors , among whom we may specially mention Leo XIII , of blessed memory , to write these_things to you , Venerable Brethren , on the case of the Indians . But it will be for you to strive according to your strength to give abundant satisfaction to our desires . You will assuredly be helped in this by those_who bear rule in these Republics ; nor will you want the work and care of the clergy , especially_those devoted to the sacred missions ; and , lastly , all good men will be with you , and those_who can , with gifts or other offices of charity , will_help a cause in which both religion and the dignity of manhood are involved . And , what_-isaia- the chief thing , the grace of Almighty God will be with you , in token whereof and as a pledge of our goodwill , we most lovingly impart new Apostolic benediction to you , Venerable Brethren , and to your flocks .
