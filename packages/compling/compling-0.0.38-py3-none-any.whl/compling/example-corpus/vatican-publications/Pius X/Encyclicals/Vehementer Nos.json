Venerable Brethren , Well Beloved Sons , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . Our soul -isaia- full of sorrowful solicitude and Our heart overflows with grief , when Our thoughts dwell upon you . How , indeed , could it be otherwise , immediately after_the promulgation of that law which , by sundering violently the old ties that linked your nation with the Apostolic See , creates for the Catholic Church in France a situation unworthy of her and ever to be lamented ? That -isaia- , beyond question , an event of the gravest import , and one that_must be deplored by all the right minded , for it -isaia- as disastrous to society as it -isaia- to religion ; but_it_-isaia- an event which_can have surprised nobody who_has paid any attention to the religious policy followed in France of late years . For you , Venerable Brethren , it will certainly have_been nothing new or strange , witnesses as you have_been of the many dreadful blows aimed from time to time by the public_authority -atti_degli_apostoli- religion . You have_seen the sanctity and the inviolability of Christian marriage outraged by legislative acts in formal contradiction with_them ; the schools and hospitals laicized ; clerics torn from their studies and from ecclesiastical discipline to be subjected to military service ; the religious congregations dispersed and despoiled , and their members for the most part reduced to the last stage of destitution . Other legal measures which_you all know have followed : the law ordaining public prayers -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of each Parliamentary Session and of the assizes has_been abolished ; the signs of mourning traditionally observed on board the ships on Good Friday suppressed ; the religious character effaced from the judicial oath ; all actions and emblems serving in any_way to recall_the idea of religion banished from the courts , the schools , the army , the navy , and in a word from all public establishments . These measures and others still which , one after another really separated the Church from the State , were but so many steps designedly made to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- complete and official separation , as the authors of them have publicly and frequently admitted . On the other_hand the Holy See has spared absolutely no means to avert this_great calamity . While it was untiring in warning those_who were -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of affairs in France , and in conjuring them over and over again to weigh well the immensity of the evils that_would infallibly result from their separatist policy , it -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time lavished upon France the most striking proofs of indulgent affection . It has then reason to hope_that gratitude would_have stayed those politicians on their downward path , and brought them -atti_degli_apostoli- last to relinquish their designs . But all has_been in vain the attentions , good offices , and efforts of Our Predecessor and Ourself . The enemies of religion have succeeded -atti_degli_apostoli- last in effecting by violence what they_have long desired , in defiance of your rights as a Catholic nation and of the wishes of all who think rightly . At a moment of such gravity for the Church , therefore , filled_with_the sense of Our Apostolic responsibility , We have considered it Our duty to raise Our voice and to open Our heart to you , Venerable Brethren , and to your clergy_and_people to all of you whom We have ever cherished with_special affection but whom We now , as -isaia- only right , love more tenderly than_ever . That the State must be separated_from the Church -isaia- a thesis absolutely false , a most pernicious error . Based , as it -isaia- , on the principle that the State must_not recognize any religious cult , it -isaia- in the first_place guilty of a great injustice to God ; for the Creator of man -isaia-_also the Founder of human societies , and preserves their existence as He preserves our_own . We owe Him , therefore , not_only a private cult , but a public and social worship to honor Him . Besides , this thesis -isaia- an obvious negation of the supernatural order . It limits the action of the State to the pursuit of public prosperity during_this life only , which_-isaia- but the proximate object of political societies ; and it occupies itself in no fashion on the plea that_this_-isaia- foreign to it with_their ultimate object which_-isaia- man s eternal happiness after this short life shall_have run its course . But as the present order of things -isaia- temporary and subordinated to the conquest of man s supreme and absolute welfare , it follows_that the civil_power must_not only place no obstacle in the way of this conquest , but must aid us in effecting it . The same thesis also upsets the order providentially established by God in the world , which demands a harmonious agreement between_the two societies . Both of them , the civil and the religious society , although each exercises in its_own sphere its authority over them . It follows necessarily that there_are_many things belonging to them in common in which both societies must_have relations with one_another . Remove the agreement between Church and State , and the result will be that from_these common matters will spring the seeds of disputes which will_become acute on both sides ; it will_become more difficult to see where_the truth lies , and great confusion -isaia- certain to arise . Finally , this thesis inflicts great injury on society itself , for it cannot either prosper or last long when due place -isaia- not left for religion , which_-isaia- the supreme rule and the sovereign mistress in all questions touching the rights and the duties of men . Hence the Roman Pontiffs have_never ceased , as circumstances required , to refute and condemn the doctrine of the separation of Church and State . Our illustrious predecessor , Leo XIII , especially , has frequently and magnificently expounded Catholic teaching on the relations which_should subsist between_the two societies . '' Between them , '' he says , '' there_must necessarily be a suitable union , which_may not improperly be compared with_that existing between body_and_soul . Quaedam intercedat necesse -ester- ordinata colligatio inter illas quae quidem conjunctioni non immerito comparatur , per quam anima et corpus in homine copulantur . '' He proceeds : '' Human societies cannot , without becoming criminal , act as if God did not_exist or refuse to concern themselves_with religion , as though it were something foreign to them , or of no purpose to them . As for the Church , which_has God Himself for its author , to exclude her from the active life of the nation , from the laws , the education of the young , the family , -isaia- to commit a great and pernicious error . Civitates non possunt , citra scellus , gerere se tamquam si Deus omnino non esset , aut curam religionis velut alienam nihilque profuturam abjicere . Ecclesiam vero , quam Deus ipse constituit , -abacuc- actione vitae excludere , a legibus , -abacuc- institutione adolescentium , a societate domestica , magnus et perniciousus -ester- error . And if it -isaia- true_that any Christian State does something eminently disastrous and reprehensible in separating itself from the Church , how much_more deplorable -isaia- it that France , of all nations in the world , would_have entered on this policy ; France which_has_been during the course of centuries the object of such_great and special predilection on the part of the Apostolic See whose fortunes and glories have ever been closely bound up with the practice of Christian virtue and respect_for religion . Leo XIII had truly good_reason to say : '' France cannot forget_that Providence has united its destiny with the Holy See by ties too strong and too old that_she should ever wish to break them . And it -isaia- this union that_has_been the source of her real greatness and her purest glories . To disturb this traditional union would be to deprive the nation of part of her moral force and great influence in the world . And the ties that consecrated this union should_have been doubly inviolable from the fact_that they_were sanctioned by sworn treaties . The Concordat entered upon by the Sovereign Pontiff and the French Government was , like all treaties of the same kind concluded between States , a bilateral contract binding on both parties to it . The Roman Pontiff on the one side and the Head of the French Nation on the other solemnly stipulated both_for themselves and their successors to maintain inviolate the pact they signed . Hence the same rule applied to the Concordat as to all international treaties , viz . , the law of nations which prescribes that it could_not be in any_way annulled by one alone of the contracting parties . The Holy See has_always observed with scrupulous fidelity the engagements it has made , and it has_always required the same fidelity from the State . This -isaia- a truth_which no impartial judge can deny . Yet today the State , by its sole authority , abrogates the solemn pact it signed . Thus it violates its sworn promise . To break with the Church , to free itself from her friendship , it has stopped -atti_degli_apostoli- nothing , and has not hesitated to outrage the Apostolic See by this violation of the law of nations , and to disturb the social and political order itself for the reciprocal security of nations in their relations with one_another depends mainly on the inviolable fidelity and the sacred respect with which_they observe their treaties . The extent of the injury inflicted on the Apostolic See by the unilateral abrogation of the Concordat -isaia- notably aggravated by the manner in which_the State has effected this abrogation . It -isaia- a principle admitted without controversy , and universally observed by all nations , that the breaking of a treaty should be previously and regularly notified , in a clear and explicit manner , to the other contracting party by the one_which intends to put an end to the treaty . Yet not_only has no notification of this_kind been_made to the Holy See , but no indication whatever on the subject has_been conveyed to it . Thus the French Government has not hesitated to treat the Apostolic See without ordinary respect and without_the courtesy that_-isaia- never omitted even in dealing_with the smallest States . Its officials , representatives though_they were of a Catholic nation , have heaped contempt on the dignity and power of the Sovereign Pontiff , the Supreme Head of the Church , whereas they should_have shown more respect to this_power than to any_other political power and a respect all the greater from the fact_that the Holy See -isaia- concerned_with the eternal welfare of souls , and that_its mission extends everywhere . If We now proceed to examine in itself the law that_has just been promulgated , We find , therein , fresh reason_for protesting still_more energetically . When the State broke the links of the Concordat , and separated itself from the Church , it ought , as a natural consequence , to have left her independence , and allowed her to enjoy peacefully that liberty , granted by the common law , which it pretended to assign to her . Nothing of the kind has_been done . We recognize in the law many exceptional and odiously restrictive provisions , the effect of which_-isaia- to place the Church under the domination of the civil_power . It has_been a source of bitter grief to Us to see the State thus encroach on matters which_are within_the exclusive jurisdiction of the Church ; and We bewail this all the more from the fact_that the State , dead to all sense of equity and justice , has thereby created for the Church of France a situation grievous , crushing , and oppressive of her most_sacred rights . For the provisions of the new law are contrary to the constitution on which_the Church was founded by Jesus Christ . The Scripture teaches us , and the tradition of the Fathers confirms the teaching , that the Church -isaia- the mystical_body of Christ , ruled by the Pastors and Doctors I Ephes . a society of men containing within its_own fold chiefs who_have full and perfect powers for ruling , teaching and judging Matt . It follows_that the Church -isaia- essentially an unequal society , that_-isaia- , a society comprising two categories of per sons , the Pastors and the flock , those_who occupy a rank in the different degrees of the hierarchy and the multitude of the faithful . So distinct are these categories that_with the pastoral body only rests the necessary right and authority for promoting the end of the society and directing all its_members towards that end ; the one duty of the multitude -isaia- to allow themselves to be led , and , like a docile flock , to follow_the Pastors . Cyprian , Martyr , expresses this_truth admirably when he writes : '' Our Lord , whose precepts we must revere and observe , in establishing the episcopal dignity and the nature of the Church , addresses Peter thus in the gospel : Ego dico tibi , quia tu -esodo- Petrus , etc . Hence , through all the vicissitudes of time and circumstance , the plan of the episcopate and the constitution of the Church have always_been found to be so framed that the Church rests on the Bishops , and that all its acts are ruled by them . Dominus Noster , cujus praecepta metuere et servare debemus , episcopi honorem et ecclesiae suae rationem disponens , in evangelio loquitur et dicit Petro : Ego dico tibi quia tu -esodo- Petrus , etc . Inde per temporum et successionum vices Episcoporum ordinatio et Ecclesiae ratio decurrit , ut Ecclesia super Episcopos constituatur et omnis actus Ecclesiae per eosdem praepositos gubernetur '' St . Cyprian affirms that all this_-isaia- based on Divine law , divina lege fundatum . The Law of Separation , in opposition to these_principles , assigns the administration and the supervision of public worship not to the hierarchical body divinely instituted by Our Savior , but to an association formed of laymen . To this association it assigns a special form and a juridical personality , and considers it alone as having rights and responsibilities in the eyes of the law in all matters appertaining to religious worship . It -isaia- this association which_-isaia- to have_the use of the churches and sacred edifices , which_-isaia- to possess ecclesiastical property , real and personal , which_-isaia- to have -atti_degli_apostoli- its disposition though only_for a time the residences of the Bishops and priests and the seminaries ; which_-isaia- to administer the property , regulate collections , and receive the alms and the legacies destined for religious worship . As for the hierarchical body of Pastors , the law_-isaia- completely silent . And if it does prescribe that the associations of worship are to be constituted in harmony_with_the general rules of organization of the cult whose existence they_are designed to assure , it -isaia- none the less true_that care has_been taken to declare that in all disputes which_may arise relative to their property the Council of State -isaia-_the_only competent tribunal . These associations of worship are therefore placed in such a state of dependence on the civil authority that the ecclesiastical authority will , clearly , have no power over them . It -isaia- obvious -atti_degli_apostoli- a glance that all these provisions seriously violate the rights of the Church , and are in opposition with_her Divine constitution . Moreover , the law on these points -isaia- not set_forth in clear and precise terms , but_-isaia- left so vague and so open to arbitrary decisions that_its mere interpretation -isaia- well calculated to be productive of the greatest trouble . Besides , nothing_more hostile to the liberty of the Church than_this Law could well be conceived . For , with the existence of the associations of worship , the Law of Separation hinders the Pastors from exercising the plenitude of their authority and of their office over the faithful ; when it attributes to the Council of State supreme jurisdiction over these associations and submits them to a whole series of prescriptions not contained in the common law , rendering their formation difficult and their continued existence more difficult still ; when , after proclaiming the liberty of public worship , it proceeds to restrict its exercise by numerous exceptions ; when it despoils the Church of the internal regulation of the churches in order to invest the State with this function ; when it thwarts the preaching of Catholic faith_and_morals and sets up a severe and exceptional penal code for clerics when it sanctions all these provisions and many_others of the same kind in which wide scope -isaia- left to arbitrary ruling , does it not place the Church in a position of humiliating subjection and , under the pretext of protecting public order , deprive peaceable citizens , who still constitute the vast majority in France , of the sacred right of practicing their religion ? Hence it -isaia- not merely by restricting the exercise of worship to which_the Law of Separation falsely reduces the essence of religion that the State injures the Church , but by putting obstacles to her influence , always a beneficent influence over the people , and by paralyzing her activity in a thousand different_ways . Thus , for instance , the State has not_been satisfied with depriving the Church of the Religious Orders , those precious auxiliaries of hers in her sacred mission , in teaching and education , in charitable works , but it must_also deprive her of the resources which constitute the human means necessary_for her existence and the accomplishment of her_mission . In addition to the wrongs and injuries to which_we_have so far referred , the Law of Separation also violates and tramples under foot the rights of property of the Church . In defiance of all justice , it despoils the Church of a great portion of a patrimony which belongs to her by titles as numerous as they_are sacred ; it suppresses and annuls all the pious foundations consecrated , with perfect legality , to divine_worship and to suffrages for the dead . The resources furnished by Catholic liberality for the maintenance of Catholic schools , and the working of various charitable associations connected_with religion , have_been transferred to lay associations in which it would be idle to seek for a vestige of religion . In this it violates not_only the rights of the Church , but the formal and explicit purpose of the donors and testators . It -isaia-_also a subject of keen grief to Us that the law , in contempt of all right , proclaims as property of the State , Departments or Communes the ecclesiastical edifices dating from before the Concordat . True , the Law concedes the gratuitous use , for an indefinite period , of these to the associations of worship , but it surrounds the concession with so many and so serious reserves that in reality it leaves to the public powers the full disposition of them . Moreover , We entertain the gravest fears for the sanctity of those temples , the august refuges of the Divine Majesty and endeared by a thousand memories to the piety of the French people . For they_are certainly in danger of profanation if they fall_into the hands of laymen . When the law , by the suppression of the Budget of Public Worship , exonerates the State from the obligation of providing for the expenses of worship , it violates an engagement contracted in a diplomatic convention , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time commits a great injustice . On this_point there cannot be the slightest doubt , for the documents of history offer the clearest confirmation of it . When the French Government assumed in the Concordat the obligation of supplying the clergy with a revenue sufficient for their decent subsistence and for the requirements of public worship , the concession was_not a merely gratuitous one it was an obligation assumed by the State to make restitution , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in part , to the Church whose property had_been confiscated during the first Revolution . On the other_hand when_the Roman Pontiff in this_same Concordat bound himself and his_successors , for the sake of peace , not to disturb the possessors of property thus taken from the Church , he did so only on one condition : that the French Government should bind itself in perpetuity to endow the clergy suitably and to provide_for the expenses of divine_worship . Finally , there_-isaia- another point on which We cannot be silent . Besides the injury it inflicts on the interests of the Church , the new law_-isaia- destined to be most disastrous to your_country . For there_can be no doubt but_that it lamentably destroys union and concord . And yet without such union and concord no nation can live long or prosper . Especially in the present state of Europe , the maintenance of perfect harmony must be the most ardent wish of everybody in France who loves his country and has its salvation -atti_degli_apostoli- heart . As for Us , following_the_example of Our Predecessor and inheriting from him a special predilection for your nation , We have_not confined Ourself to striving for the preservation of full rights of the religion of your forefathers , but We have_always , with_that fraternal peace of which religion_-isaia- certainly the strongest bond ever before Our eyes , endeavored to promote unity among_you . We cannot , therefore , without_the keenest sorrow observe that the French Government has just done a deed which inflames on religious grounds passions already too dangerously excited , and which , therefore , seems to be calculated to plunge the whole country into disorder . Hence , mindful of Our Apostolic charge and conscious of the imperious duty incumbent upon Us of defending and preserving against all assaults the full and absolute integrity of the sacred and inviolable rights of the Church , We do , by virtue of the supreme_authority which God has confided to Us , and on the grounds above set_forth , reprove and condemn the law voted in France for the separation of Church and State , as deeply unjust to God whom it denies , and as laying down the principle that the Republic recognizes no cult . We reprove and condemn it as violating the natural_law , the law of nations , and fidelity to treaties ; as contrary to the Divine constitution of the Church , to her essential rights and to her liberty ; as destroying justice and trampling underfoot the rights of property which_the Church has acquired by many titles and , in addition , by virtue of the Concordat . We reprove and condemn it as gravely offensive to the dignity of this Apostolic See , to Our own person , to the Episcopacy , and to the clergy and all the Catholics of France . Therefore , We protest solemnly and with all Our strength against the introduction , the voting and the promulgation of this_law , declaring that it can_never be alleged against the imprescriptible rights of the Church . We had to address these grave words to you , Venerable Brethren , to the people of France and of the whole Christian world , in order to make known in its true light what_has_been done . Deep indeed -isaia- Our distress when We look into the future and see there the evils that_this law_-isaia- about to bring upon a people so tenderly loved by Us . And We are still_more grievously affected by the thought of the trials , sufferings and tribulations of all kinds that_are to be visited on you , Venerable Brethren , and on all your_clergy . Yet , in the midst of these crushing cares , We are saved from excessive affliction and discouragement when Our mind turns to Divine Providence , so rich in mercies , and to the hope , a thousand times verified , that Jesus Christ will_not abandon His Church or ever deprive her of His unfailing support . We are , then , far from feeling any fear for the Church . Her strength and her stability are Divine , as the experience of ages triumphantly proves . The world knows of the endless calamities , each more terrible than the last , that_have fallen upon her during_this long course of time but where all purely human institutions must inevitably have succumbed , the Church has drawn_from her trials only fresh strength and richer fruitfulness . As to the persecuting laws passed against her , history teaches , even in recent_times , and France itself confirms the lesson , that though forged by hatred , they_are always -atti_degli_apostoli- last wisely abrogated , when_they_are found to be prejudicial to the interests of the State . God grant those_who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- present in power in France may soon follow_the example set for them in this_matter by their predecessors . God grant that_they_may , amid the applause of all good people , make haste to restore to religion , the source of civilization and prosperity , the honor which_-isaia- due to her together_with her liberty . Meanwhile , and as long as oppressive persecution continues , the children of the Church , putting on the arms of light , must act with all their strength in defense of Truth and justice it -isaia- their_duty always , and today more_than_ever . To this_holy contest you , Venerable Brethren , who_are to be the teachers and guides , will_bring all the force of that vigilant and indefatigable zeal of which_the French Episcopate has , to its honor , given so many well_known proofs . But above all things We wish , for it -isaia- of the greatest importance , that in all the plans you undertake for the defense of the Church , you to endeavor to ensure the most perfect union of hearts and wills . It -isaia- Our firm intention to give_you -atti_degli_apostoli- a fitting time practical instructions which shall serve as a sure rule of conduct for you amid the great difficulties of the present_time . And We are certain in advance that_you will faithfully adopt them . Meanwhile continue the salutary work you_are doing ; strive to kindle piety among the people as much as possible ; promote and popularize more_and_more the teaching of Christian doctrine ; preserve the souls entrusted to you from the errors and seductions they meet on all sides ; instruct , warn , encourage , console your flocks , and perform for them all the duties imposed on you by your pastoral_office . In this_work you will certainly find indefatigable collaborators in your_clergy . They are rich in men remarkable for piety , knowledge , and devotion to the Holy See , and We know that_they_are always ready to devote_themselves unreservedly under your direction to the cause of the triumph of the Church and the eternal salvation_of_souls . The clergy will_also certainly understand_that during the present turmoil they_must be animated by the sentiments professed long ago by the Apostles , rejoicing that_they_are found worthy to suffer opprobrium for the name of Jesus , '' Gaudentes quoniam digni habiti sunt pro nomine Jesu contumeliam pati '' Rom . They will therefore stoutly stand up for the rights and liberty of the Church , but without offense to anybody . Nay more , in their earnestness to preserve charity , as the ministers of Jesus Christ are especially bound to do , they_will reply to iniquity with justice , to outrage with mildness , and to ill treatment with benefits . And now We turn to you , Catholics of France , asking you to receive Our words as a testimony of that_most tender affection with_which We have_never ceased to love your_country , and as comfort to you in the midst of the terrible calamities through_which you will_have to pass . You know_the aim of the impious sects which_are placing your heads under their yoke , for they_themselves have proclaimed with cynical boldness that_they_are determined to '' de Catholicise '' France . They want to root out from your hearts the last vestige of the faith_which covered your fathers with glory , which made your_country great and prosperous among nations , which sustains you in your trials , which brings tranquillity and peace to your homes , and which opens to you the way to eternal happiness . You feel_that you_must defend this faith with your whole souls . But be not deluded all labor and effort will be useless if you endeavor to repulse the assaults made on you without being firmly united . Remove , therefore , any causes of disunion that may exist among_you . And do what_-isaia- necessary to ensure_that your unity may be as strong as it should be among_men who_are fighting for the same cause , especially_when this cause -isaia- of those for the triumph of which everybody should be willing to sacrifice something of his_own opinions . If you wish , within_the limits of your strength and according to your imperious duty , to save the religion of your ancestors from the dangers to which_it_-isaia- exposed , it -isaia- of the first importance that_you show a large degree of courage and generosity . We feel sure_that you will show this generosity ; and by being charitable towards God s ministers , you will incline God to be more_and_more charitable toward yourselves . As for the defense of religion , if you wish to undertake it in a worthy manner , and to carry it on perseveringly and efficaciously , two things_are first of all necessary : you_must model yourselves so faithfully on the precepts of the Christian law that all your actions and your entire lives may do honor to the faith you profess , and then you_must be closely united with those_whose special office it -isaia- to watch over religion , with your priests , your bishops , and above all with this Apostolic See , which_-isaia- the pivot of the Catholic faith and of all that_can be done in its name . Thus armed for the fray , go forth fearlessly for the defense of the Church ; but take_care that_your trust -isaia- placed entirely in God , for whose cause you_are working , and never cease to pray to Him for help . For Us , as long as you_have to struggle against danger , We will be heart and soul in the midst of you ; labors , pains , sufferings We will share them all with you ; and pouring forth to God , who_has founded the Church and ever preserves her , Our most humble and instant prayers , We will implore Him to bend a glance of mercy on France , to save her from the storms that have_been let loose upon her , and , by the intercession of Mary Immaculate , to restore soon to her the blessings of calm and peace . As a pledge of these heavenly_gifts and a proof of Our special predilection , We impart with all Our heart_the Apostolic Benediction to you , Venerable Brethren , to your_clergy and to the entire French people .
