{"title": "Dignitatis Humanae", "author": "Vatican Council II", "type_of_text": "Documents", "pub_date": "07/12/1965", "text": "A sense of the dignity_of_the_human_person has_been impressing itself more_and_more deeply on the consciousness of contemporary man , and the demand -isaia- increasingly made that_men should act on their_own judgment , enjoying and making use of a responsible freedom , not driven by coercion but motivated by a sense of duty . The demand -isaia- likewise made that constitutional limits should be set to the powers of government , in order_that there_may be no encroachment on the rightful freedom of the person and of associations . This demand for freedom in human_society chiefly regards the quest for the values proper to the human spirit . It regards , in the first_place , the free exercise of religion in society . This Vatican Council takes careful note of these desires in the minds_of_men . It proposes to declare them to be greatly in accord with truth and justice . To this_end , it searches into the sacred tradition and doctrine of the Church the treasury out of which_the Church continually brings forth new things_that_are in harmony_with_the things_that_are old . First , the council professes its belief that God Himself has made_known to mankind the way_in_which men_are to serve Him , and thus be saved in Christ and come to blessedness . We believe_that this one true religion subsists in the Catholic and Apostolic Church , to which_the Lord Jesus committed the duty of spreading it abroad among all men . Thus He spoke to the Apostles : '' Go , therefore , and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have enjoined upon you '' Matt . : . On their_part , all men are_bound to seek the truth , especially in what concerns God and His Church , and to embrace the truth they come to know , and to hold fast to it . This Vatican Council likewise professes its belief that_it_-isaia- upon the human conscience that_these obligations fall and exert their binding force . The truth cannot impose itself except by virtue of its_own truth , as it makes its entrance into the mind -atti_degli_apostoli- once quietly and with power . Religious freedom , in turn , which men demand as necessary to fulfill their_duty to worship God , has to do with immunity from coercion in civil_society . Therefore it leaves untouched traditional Catholic doctrine on the moral duty of men and societies toward_the true religion and toward_the one Church of Christ . Over and above all this , the council intends to develop the doctrine of recent popes on the inviolable rights of the human_person and the constitutional order of society . . This Vatican Council declares that the human_person has a right to religious_freedom . This freedom means_that all men_are to be immune from coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of any human power , in such wise that no one_-isaia- to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his_own beliefs , whether privately or publicly , whether alone or in association with_others , within due limits . The council further declares that the right to religious_freedom has its foundation in the very dignity_of_the_human_person as this dignity -isaia- known through the revealed word of God and by reason itself . This right of the human_person to religious_freedom -isaia- to be recognized in the constitutional law whereby society_-isaia- governed and thus it -isaia- to become a civil right . It -isaia- in accordance_with their_dignity as persons that_-isaia- , beings endowed_with reason and free will and therefore privileged to bear personal responsibility that all men should be -atti_degli_apostoli- once impelled by nature and also bound by a moral obligation to seek the truth , especially religious truth . They are_also bound to adhere to the truth , once it -isaia- known , and to order their whole lives in accord with the demands of truth . However , men cannot discharge these obligations in a manner in keeping_with their_own nature unless they enjoy immunity from external coercion as well as psychological freedom . Therefore the right to religious_freedom has its foundation not in the subjective disposition of the person , but in his_very nature . In consequence , the right to this immunity continues to exist even in those who_do_not live up to their obligation of seeking the truth and adhering to it and the exercise of this right -isaia- not to be impeded , provided_that just public order be observed . . Further light -isaia- shed on the subject if one considers that the highest norm of human life_-isaia- the divine_law eternal , objective and universal whereby God orders , directs and governs the entire universe and all the ways of the human community by a plan conceived in wisdom and love . Man has been_made by God to participate in this_law , with the result that , under the gentle disposition of divine Providence , he can come to perceive ever more_fully the truth that_-isaia- unchanging . Wherefore every man_has the duty , and therefore the right , to seek the truth in matters religious in order that_he_may with prudence form for_himself right and true judgments of conscience , under use of all suitable means . Truth , however , -isaia- to be sought after in a manner proper to the dignity_of_the_human_person and his social nature . The inquiry -isaia- to be free , carried on with the aid of teaching or instruction , communication and dialogue , in the course of which men explain to one_another the truth they_have discovered , or think they_have discovered , in order thus to assist one_another in the quest for truth . Moreover , as the truth_-isaia- discovered , it -isaia- by a personal assent that_men are to adhere to it . On his part , man perceives and acknowledges the imperatives of the divine_law through the mediation of conscience . In all his activity a man_-isaia- bound to follow his conscience in order that_he_may come to God , the end and purpose of life . It follows that_he_-isaia- not to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his conscience . Nor , on the other_hand , -isaia- he to be restrained from acting in accordance_with his conscience , especially in matters religious . The reason -isaia- that the exercise of religion , of its_very nature , consists before all else in those internal , voluntary and free acts whereby man sets the course of his_life directly toward God . No merely human power can either command or prohibit acts of this_kind . The social nature of man , however , itself requires that he should give external expression to his internal acts of religion : that he should share with_others in matters religious ; that he should profess his religion in community . Injury therefore -isaia- done to the human_person and to the very order established by God for human_life , if the free exercise of religion_-isaia- denied in society , provided just public order -isaia- observed . There -isaia- a further consideration . The religious acts whereby men , in private and in public and out of a sense of personal conviction , direct their_lives to God transcend by their_very nature the order of terrestrial and temporal affairs . Government therefore ought indeed to take account of the religious_life of the citizenry and show it favor , since_the function of government -isaia- to make provision for the common welfare . However , it would clearly transgress the limits set to its power , were it to presume to command or inhibit acts that_are religious . . The freedom or immunity from coercion in matters religious which_-isaia- the endowment of persons as individuals -isaia-_also to be recognized as their right when_they act in community . Religious communities are a requirement of the social nature both of man and of religion itself . Provided the just demands of public order are observed , religious communities rightfully claim freedom in order that_they_may govern themselves according_to_their own norms , honor the Supreme Being in public worship , assist their members in the practice of the religious_life , strengthen them by instruction , and promote institutions in which_they may join together for the purpose of ordering their_own lives in accordance_with their religious principles . Religious communities also have_the right not to be hindered , either by legal measures or by administrative action on the part of government , in the selection , training , appointment , and transferral of their_own ministers , in communicating with religious authorities and communities abroad , in erecting buildings for religious purposes , and in the acquisition and use of suitable funds or properties . Religious communities also have_the right not to be hindered in their public teaching and witness to their_faith , whether by the spoken or by the written word . However , in spreading religious faith and in introducing religious practices everyone ought -atti_degli_apostoli- all times to refrain from any manner of action which might seem to carry a hint of coercion or of a kind of persuasion that_would be dishonorable or unworthy , especially_when dealing_with poor or uneducated people . Such a manner of action would_have to be considered an abuse of one s right and a violation of the right of others . In addition , it comes within_the meaning of religious_freedom that religious communities should_not be prohibited from freely undertaking to show the special value of their doctrine in what concerns the organization of society and the inspiration of the whole of human activity . Finally , the social nature of man and the very nature of religion afford the foundation of the right of men freely to hold meetings and to establish educational , cultural , charitable and social organizations , under the impulse of their_own religious sense . . The family , since_it_-isaia- a society in its_own original right , has the right freely to live its_own domestic religious_life under_the_guidance of parents . Parents , moreover , have_the right to determine , in accordance_with their_own religious beliefs , the kind of religious education that their_children are to receive . Government , in consequence , must acknowledge_the right of parents to make a genuinely free choice of schools and of other means of education , and the use of this freedom of choice -isaia- not to be made a reason_for imposing unjust burdens on parents , whether directly or indirectly . Besides , the right of parents are violated , if their_children are forced to attend lessons or instructions which_are not in agreement with_their religious beliefs , or if a single system of education , from which all religious formation_-isaia- excluded , -isaia- imposed upon all . . Since the common welfare of society consists in the entirety of those conditions of social_life under which men enjoy_the possibility of achieving their_own perfection in a certain fullness of measure and also_with some relative ease , it chiefly consists in the protection of the rights , and in the performance of the duties , of the human_person . Therefore the care of the right to religious_freedom devolves upon the whole citizenry , upon social groups , upon government , and upon the Church and other religious communities , in virtue of the duty of all toward_the common welfare , and in the manner proper to each . The protection and promotion of the inviolable rights of man ranks among the essential duties of government . Therefore government -isaia- to assume the safeguard of the religious_freedom of all its citizens , in an effective manner , by just laws and by other appropriate means . Government -isaia-_also to help create conditions favorable to the fostering of religious_life , in order_that the people may be truly enabled to exercise their religious rights and to fulfill their religious duties , and also in order_that society itself may profit by the moral qualities of justice_and_peace which have_their origin in men s faithfulness to God and to His holy will . If , in view of peculiar circumstances obtaining among peoples , special civil recognition -isaia- given to one religious community in the constitutional order of society , it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time imperative that the right of all citizens and religious communities to religious_freedom should be recognized and made effective in practice . Finally , government -isaia- to see_to_it_that equality of citizens before the law , which_-isaia- itself an element of the common_good , -isaia- never violated , whether openly or covertly , for religious reasons . Nor -isaia- there to be discrimination among citizens . It follows_that a wrong -isaia- done when government imposes upon its people , by force or fear or other means , the profession or repudiation of any religion , or when it hinders men from joining or leaving a religious community . All the more -isaia- it a violation of the will of God and of the sacred rights of the person and the family of nations when force -isaia- brought to bear in any_way in order to destroy or repress religion , either in the whole of mankind or in a particular country or in a definite community . . The right to religious_freedom -isaia- exercised in human_society : hence its exercise -isaia- subject to certain regulatory norms . In the use of all freedoms the moral principle of personal and social responsibility -isaia- to be observed . In the exercise of their_rights , individual men and social groups are_bound by the moral_law to have respect both_for the rights of others and for their_own duties toward others and for the common welfare of all . Men are to deal with_their fellows in justice and civility . Furthermore , society has the right to defend itself against possible abuses committed on the pretext of freedom of religion . It -isaia- the special duty of government to provide this protection . However , government -isaia- not to act in an arbitrary fashion or in an unfair spirit of partisanship . Its action -isaia- to be controlled by juridical norms which_are in conformity_with_the objective moral_order . These norms arise out of the need_for the effective safeguard of the rights of all citizens and for the peaceful settlement of conflicts of rights , also out of the need_for an adequate care of genuine public peace , which_comes about when men live together in good order and in true justice , and finally out of the need_for a proper guardianship of public morality . These matters constitute the basic component of the common welfare : they_are what_-isaia- meant by public order . For the rest , the usages of society are to be the usages of freedom in their full range : that_-isaia- , the freedom of man_-isaia- to be respected as far_as_possible and -isaia- not to be curtailed except when and insofar as necessary . . Many pressures are brought to bear upon the men of our_day , to the point where_the danger arises lest they lose the possibility of acting on their_own judgment . On the other_hand , not_a_few can be found who seem inclined to use the name of freedom as the pretext for refusing to submit to authority and for making light of the duty of obedience . Wherefore this Vatican Council urges everyone , especially_those who_are charged with the task of educating others , to do their utmost to form men_who , on the one_hand , will respect the moral_order and be obedient to lawful authority , and on the other_hand , will be lovers of true freedom men , in other_words , who_will come to decisions on their_own judgment and in the light of truth , govern their activities with a sense_of_responsibility , and strive after what_-isaia- true and right , willing always to join with_others in cooperative effort . Religious freedom therefore ought to have this further purpose and aim , namely_,_that men may come to act with_greater responsibility in fulfilling their_duties in community life . . The declaration of this Vatican Council on the right of man to religious_freedom has its foundation in the dignity of the person , whose exigencies have come to be are fully known to human_reason through centuries of experience . What -isaia- more , this_doctrine of freedom has roots in divine_revelation , and for this_reason Christians are_bound to respect it all the more conscientiously . Revelation does_not indeed affirm in so many words the right of man to immunity from external coercion in matters religious . It does , however , disclose the dignity_of_the_human_person in its_full dimensions . It gives evidence of the respect which Christ showed toward_the freedom with_which man_-isaia- to fulfill his duty of belief in the word of God and it gives us lessons in the spirit_which disciples of such a Master ought to adopt and continually follow . Thus further light -isaia- cast upon the general principles upon which_the doctrine of this declaration on religious_freedom -isaia- based . In particular , religious_freedom in society_-isaia- entirely consonant with the freedom of the act of Christian faith . . It -isaia- one of the major tenets of Catholic doctrine that_man s response to God in faith must be free : no one therefore -isaia- to be forced to embrace the Christian faith against his_own will . This doctrine -isaia- contained in the word of God and it was constantly proclaimed by the Fathers of the Church . The act of faith_-isaia- of its_very nature a free act . Man , redeemed by Christ the Savior and through Christ Jesus called to be God s adopted son , cannot give his adherence to God revealing Himself unless , under the drawing of the Father , he offers to God the reasonable and free submission of faith . It -isaia- therefore completely in accord with the nature of faith_that in matters religious every manner of coercion on the part of men should be excluded . In consequence , the principle of religious_freedom makes no small contribution to the creation of an environment in which men can without hindrance be invited to the Christian faith , embrace it of their_own free will , and profess it effectively in their whole manner of life . . God calls men to serve Him in spirit and in truth , hence they are_bound in conscience but_they stand under no compulsion . God has regard_for the dignity_of_the_human_person whom He Himself created and man_-isaia- to be guided by his_own judgment and he -isaia- to enjoy freedom . This truth appears -atti_degli_apostoli- its height in Christ Jesus , in whom God manifested Himself and His ways with men . Christ -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once our Master and our Lord and also meek and humble of heart . In attracting and inviting His disciples He used patience . He wrought miracles to illuminate His teaching and to establish its truth , but His intention was to rouse faith in His hearers and to confirm them in faith , not to exert coercion upon them . He did indeed denounce the unbelief of some who listened to Him , but He left vengeance to God in expectation of the day of judgment . When He sent His Apostles into_the_world , He said to them : '' He who believes and -isaia- baptized will be saved . He who_does_not believe will be condemned '' Mark : . But He Himself , noting that the cockle had_been sown amid the wheat , gave orders that both should be allowed to grow until the harvest time , which_will come -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the world . He refused to be a political messiah , ruling by force : He preferred to call Himself the Son of Man , who came '' to serve and to give his_life as a ransom for the many '' Mark : . He showed Himself the perfect servant of God , who '' does_not break the bruised reed nor extinguish the smoking flax '' Matt . : . He acknowledged the power of government and its rights , when He commanded that tribute be given to Caesar : but He gave clear warning that the higher rights of God are to be kept inviolate : '' Render to Caesar the things_that_are Caesar s and to God the things_that_are God s '' Matt . : . In the end , when He completed on the cross the work of redemption whereby He achieved salvation and true freedom for men , He brought His revelation to completion . For He bore witness to the truth , but He refused to impose the truth by force on those_who spoke against it . Not by force of blows does His rule assert its claims . It -isaia- established by witnessing to the truth and by hearing the truth , and it extends its dominion by the love whereby Christ , lifted up on the cross , draws all men to Himself . Taught by the word and example of Christ , the Apostles followed the same_way . From the very origins of the Church the disciples of Christ strove to convert men to faith in Christ as the Lord ; not , however , by the use of coercion or of devices unworthy of the Gospel , but by the power , above all , of the word of God . Steadfastly they proclaimed to all the plan of God our Savior , '' who wills that all men should be saved and come to the acknowledgment of the truth '' Tim . : . At the same_time , however , they showed respect_for those of weaker stuff , even_though they_were in error , and thus they made it plain that '' each_one of us -isaia- to render to God an account of himself '' Romans : , and for that_reason -isaia- bound to obey his conscience . Like Christ Himself , the Apostles were unceasingly bent upon bearing_witness to the truth of God , and they showed the fullest measure of boldness in '' speaking the word with confidence '' Acts : before the people and their rulers . With a firm faith they held that the Gospel -isaia- indeed the power of God unto salvation for all who_believe . Therefore they rejected all '' carnal weapons : they followed the example of the gentleness and respectfulness of Christ and they preached the word of God in the full confidence that_there was resident in this word itself a divine power able to destroy all the forces arrayed against God and bring men to faith in Christ and to His service . As the Master , so too the Apostles recognized legitimate civil authority . '' For there_-isaia- no power except from God '' , the Apostle teaches , and thereafter commands : '' Let everyone be subject to higher authorities . . . . He who resists authority resists God s ordinance '' Romans : . At the same_time , however , they did not_hesitate to speak out against governing powers which set themselves in opposition to the holy will of God : '' It -isaia- necessary to obey God rather_than men '' Acts : . This -isaia-_the_way along which_the martyrs and other faithful have walked through all ages and over all the earth . . In faithfulness therefore to the truth of the Gospel , the Church -isaia- following the way of Christ and the apostles when_she recognizes and gives support to the principle of religious_freedom as befitting the dignity of man and as being in accord with divine_revelation . Throughout the ages the Church has kept safe and handed on the doctrine received_from_the Master and from the apostles . In the life of the People of God , as it has made its pilgrim way through the vicissitudes of human_history , there_has -atti_degli_apostoli- times appeared a way of acting that_was hardly in accord with the spirit of the Gospel or even opposed to it . Nevertheless , the doctrine of the Church that no one_-isaia- to be coerced into faith has_always stood firm . Thus the leaven of the Gospel has long been about its quiet work in the minds_of_men , and to it -isaia- due in great measure the fact_that in the course of time men_have come more widely to recognize their_dignity as persons , and the conviction has grown stronger that the person in society_-isaia- to be kept free_from all manner of coercion in matters religious . . Among the things_that concern the good of the Church and indeed the welfare of society here on earth things therefore that_are always and everywhere to be kept secure and defended against all injury this certainly -isaia- preeminent , namely_,_that the Church should enjoy that full measure of freedom which her care_for the salvation of men requires . This -isaia- a sacred freedom , because the only_begotten Son endowed_with it the Church which He purchased with His blood . Indeed it -isaia- so much the property of the Church that to act against it -isaia- to act against the will of God . The freedom of the Church -isaia- the fundamental principle in what concerns the relations_between the Church and governments and the whole civil order . In human_society and in the face of government the Church claims freedom for herself in her character as a spiritual authority , established by Christ the Lord , upon which_there rests , by divine mandate , the duty of going out into the whole_world and preaching the Gospel to every_creature . The Church also claims freedom for herself in her character as a society of men_who have_the right to live in society in accordance_with_the precepts of the Christian faith . In turn , where_the principle of religious_freedom -isaia-_not_only proclaimed in words or simply incorporated in law but_also given sincere and practical application , there the Church succeeds in achieving a stable situation of right as well as of fact and the independence which_-isaia- necessary_for the fulfillment of her_divine mission . This independence -isaia- precisely what_the authorities of the Church claim in society . At the same_time , the Christian faithful , in common with all other men , possess the civil right not to be hindered in leading their_lives in accordance_with their consciences . Therefore , a harmony exists between_the freedom of the Church and the religious_freedom which_-isaia- to be recognized as the right of all men and communities and sanctioned by constitutional law . . In order to be faithful to the divine command , '' teach all nations '' Matt . : , the Catholic Church must work with all urgency and concern '' that the word of God be spread abroad and glorified '' Thess . : . Hence the Church earnestly begs of its children that , '' first of all , supplications , prayers , petitions , acts of thanksgiving be made for all men . . . . For this_-isaia- good and agreeable in the sight of God our Savior , who wills that all men be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth '' Tim . : . In the formation of their consciences , the Christian faithful ought carefully to attend to the sacred and certain doctrine of the Church . For the Church -isaia- , by the will of Christ , the teacher of the truth . It -isaia- her duty to give utterance to , and authoritatively to teach , that_truth which_-isaia- Christ Himself , and also to declare and confirm by her authority those principles of the moral_order which have_their origins in human_nature itself . Furthermore , let Christians walk in wisdom in the face of those outside , '' in the Holy Spirit , in unaffected love , in the word of truth '' Cor . : , and let_them be about their task of spreading the light of life with all confidence and apostolic courage , even to the shedding of their blood . The disciple -isaia- bound by a grave obligation toward Christ , his Master , ever more_fully to understand_the truth received_from Him , faithfully to proclaim it , and vigorously to defend it , never be it understood having recourse to means_that are incompatible with the spirit of the Gospel . At the same_time , the charity of Christ urges him to love and have prudence and patience in his dealings with_those_who are in error or in ignorance with_regard to the faith . All -isaia- to be taken into_account_the Christian duty to Christ , the life_giving word which_must be proclaimed , the rights of the human_person , and the measure of grace granted by God through Christ to men_who are invited freely to accept and profess the faith . . The fact -isaia- that_men of the present_day want to be able freely to profess their religion in private and in public . Indeed , religious_freedom has_already_been declared to be a civil right in most constitutions , and it -isaia- solemnly recognized in international documents . The further fact -isaia- that forms of government still exist under which , even_though freedom of religious worship receives constitutional recognition , the powers of government are engaged in the effort to deter citizens from the profession of religion and to make life very difficult and dangerous for religious communities . This council greets with_joy the first of these_two facts as among the signs of the times . With sorrow , however , it denounces the other fact , as only to be deplored . The council exhorts Catholics , and it directs a plea to all men , most carefully to consider how greatly necessary religious_freedom -isaia- , especially in the present condition of the human_family . All nations are coming into even closer unity . Men of different_cultures and religions are_being brought together in closer relationships . There -isaia- a growing consciousness of the personal responsibility that_every man_has . All this_-isaia- evident . Consequently , in order_that relationships of peace and harmony be established and maintained within_the whole of mankind , it -isaia- necessary_that religious_freedom be everywhere provided with an effective constitutional guarantee and that respect be shown for the high duty and right of man freely to lead his religious_life in society . May the God and Father of all grant that the human_family , through careful observance of the principle of religious_freedom in society , may be brought by the grace of Christ and the power of the Holy Spirit to the sublime and unending and '' glorious freedom of the sons of God '' Rom . : .", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Vatican Council II", "author_dob": "11/10/1962", "author_start": "11/10/1962", "author_end": "08/12/1965", "pontificate_years": 3}
