ANDREW BOBOLA TO THE VENERABLE BRETHREN , THE PATRIARCHS , PRIMATES , ARCHBISHOPS , BISHIOPS , AND OTHER LOCAL ORDINARIES IN PEACE AND COMMUNION WITH THE APOSTOLIC SEE Venerable Brethren , Greetings and Apostolic Benediction . On the th anniversary of the death of Christ s unconquered athlete , Andrew Bobola , We desire to direct his martyrdom and holiness of life to the devout and reverent meditation of all Catholics throughout_the_world and particularly of the children of Our dearest Poland for_whom the Saint -isaia- a glorious and shining example of Christian fortitude . This happy occasion -isaia- inscribed in the Church s annals in letters of gold , and We would_not wish to let it pass without some mention of his_life and virtues , and without proposing him , through_this Encyclical , to your imitation , Venerable Brethren , and that of the flocks committed to your_care in the measure that_each one s occupation and state of life permits . What seems to shine_forth especially in the life of Andrew Bobola -isaia-_his Catholic faith , whose vigor , nourished by divine_grace , grew so much stronger with the passing of the years that it conferred on him a special mark of distinction , and spurred him on to undergo his martyrdom with courage . '' Now my just one lives by faith , '' as the Apostles of the Gentiles declares , and in Bobola , faith shone with an unusual splendor . Whatever the Catholic Church teaches to be believed or done , he embraced with unwavering mind , and willingly endeavored to practice . Thus , from earliest youth , he considered it normal to check , control , and subdue all those disorderly inclinations which , since_the unhappy fall of Adam , disturb our nature and easily attract it to what_-isaia- forbidden . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , his every_effort and all his strength were directed to the adornment of his_soul with Christian virtues . He was_born in in the district of Sandomira , of parents distinguished by the nobility of their family , but even_more so by the vigor and constancy of their Catholic faith . Endowed with a sound and ready intelligence , he received -atti_degli_apostoli- home , from his tenderest years , a fine education and formation in Christian morality . He was later sent to the schools of the Society of Jesus , where he was remarkable for innocence of life and piety . But since he spurned the pomps and vanities of the world , and earnestly strove after '' the greater gifts , '' with the object of progressing more rapidly along the road to perfection , he gladly offered himself , when a youth of nineteen years , to the Society of Jesus , and was received into the noviceship , then -atti_degli_apostoli- Vilna . He remembered that solemn warning of Jesus Christ , '' If anyone wishes to come after Me , let_him deny himself , and take up his cross daily , and follow Me , '' and so daily strove more eagerly to acquire the virtue of Christian humility by contempt of self . But since he was by temperament proud , impatient , and sometimes obstinate , Bobola had to wage a very sharp contest against himself , and ascend his Calvary , as it were , laden with the cross , in order to reach the height of this virtue . There , -atti_degli_apostoli- length , impelled and assisted by the grace he had obtained by constant and fervent prayers , he might be able to reach Christian perfection , for as St . Bernard wisely said , '' the spiritual edifice cannot possibly stand except on the firm foundation of humility . Above all , Bobola was on fire with a great love of God and of his neighbors . As a result , he found nothing sweeter than to spend long hours , whenever possible , before the sacred tabernacle , and to assist the unfortunate in every way according_to_his means . He loved God above all , and far more_than himself . He sought exclusively God s glory , according to the Rule of his Father , St . To this Saint , then , the words of the same holy Doctor St . Bernard can be applied , '' He alone should be desired , Who alone fulfills desire . It -isaia- not surprising , then_,_that this athlete of Jesus Christ , adorned with_these gifts of grace , should_have achieved such notable progress in the apostolic field , and been_able to gather rich fruits in the saving of souls . He was on fire to preserve , extend , and defend the Catholic faith . Thus , when serving as a teacher -atti_degli_apostoli- Vilna , and later when living in other cities , he diligently taught the elements of Christian doctrine , and encouraged devotion to the Eucharist , and an ardent and filial love of the Virgin Mother of God . But afterwards , when he was raised to the dignity of the priesthood in the same year and on the same day that Ignatius and Francis Xavier were inscribed -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome in the calendar of the Saints he chose before all else to spare no labor , in ministerial journeys and by sermons on holy things , in order that_he_might spread everywhere a Catholic faith_which would_not be ineffective , but productive of good_works . But the Catholic Church , particularly in the countries to the East , was facing an extremely grave crisis owing to the efforts of the schismatics , who_were striving by every device to draw the faithful away from the unity of the Church into_their own errors . Andrew went , therefore , into those regions on the instruction and command of his Superiors , and by public sermons and private instruction through_their cities , towns , and villages , and most of all by the fervor of his exceptional holiness and the burning zeal of his apostolate , he freed the wavering faith of a multitude of Christians from beguiling falsehood , brought them back to sound principles , and joyfully invited all he could to return to the one fold of Jesus Christ . He did_not merely restore and strengthen the faith of the Christians , languishing and on the verge of collapse , but roused them also to weep for their_own sins , to settle their disputes , to heal their divisions , to restore true morality . It seemed that , like his Divine Master , wherever he passed by doing good , a new spring blossomed forth , bright with heavenly flowers and fruits of salvation . Consequently , as tradition has it , he received_from all , even from the schismatics , the significant title of '' hunter of souls . This tireless apostle of Jesus Christ had lived by faith , had spread the faith , and had defended the faith ; so too , he did not_hesitate to die for the faith of his fathers . Notable among almost countless others was_the unforgettable and savage onslaught on the Catholic religion which flared up in the th century in the Eastern countries . The Cossack forces then invaded those lands , and directed their furious attack on Catholics and their pastors , and on the heralds of the truth of the Gospel . Temples dedicated to the divine_worship were utterly destroyed ; monasteries were consumed by fire ; priests and their flocks were everywhere put to the sword ; everything was laid waste ; all that_was sacred was scattered to the winds . Andrew Bobola could apply to himself that saying , '' Nothing that_-isaia- known to belong to God , do I consider outside my interests . '' He feared death and sufferings not -atti_degli_apostoli- all . On fire with love for God and his neighbor , he entered the fray with all his resources , in order to draw back as many as he could from a foreswearing of the Catholic faith , and from the snares and errors of those_who were separated_from the Church , and in order to provide a valiant and rousing encouragement for the preservation of Christian teaching in all its integrity . But on May , , on the feast of our Lord s Ascension into_heaven , he was seized near Janovia by the enemies of the Catholics . We do not think this filled him_with fear , but_rather with a heavenly joy . For We know_that he had always prayed for martyrdom and had often recalled the words of the Divine Redeemer , '' Blessed are you when men reproach you , and persecute you , and speaking falsely say all manner of evil against you , for my sake . Rejoice and exult , because your reward -isaia- great in heaven ; for so did they persecute the prophets who_were before you . The mind shudders as it recalls all the tortures which_the athlete of Jesus Christ endured with unconquerable fortitude and a faith resolute and unbroken . For , '' beaten with rods , struck with blows , dragged by a rope behind a horse on a painful and blood stained path , he was brought to Janovia to be delivered to the final torture . '' In that contest , the Polish Martyr rose to the heights of the noblest triumphs which_the Church commemorates . Andrew was asked if he were a priest of the Latin rite , and he replied , I -amos- a Catholic priest ; I was_born in the Catholic faith ; in that_faith I wish to die . My faith_-isaia- true ; it leads to salvation . Do you rather repent ; give place to sorrow for sin , else you will be unable , in your errors , to win salvation . By embracing my faith , you will acknowledge_the true God , and will save your souls . At these_words , those wicked men , utterly devoid of humanity , were roused to a fiendish barbarity , and reached such a degree of cruelty that_they inflicted still_more horrible sufferings on the soldier of Christ . Once again , '' he was scourged , a crown like that of Jesus Christ was bound about his head , he was struck heavy blows and lay wounded by a scimitar . Next , his right eye was gouged out , strips of skin were torn off , his wounds were savagely scorched and rubbed with prickly bundles of straw . Nor was that enough : his ears , nose and lips were cut off , his tongue torn out by the root , and finally , a weapon plunged into his_heart . And , -atti_degli_apostoli- long last , the valiant athlete , three hours after midday , displaying a truly marvelous example of fortitude , was pierced by a sword and achieved the glory of martyrdom . The victorious martyr , crimsoned in his_own blood , has_been received through_his triumph into_heaven , and on earth , the Church , when_she beheld his resplendent holiness attested and confirmed by God Himself through truly remarkable miracles , proposed him for the devotion and imitation of the whole community of Christians . For in , Our Predecessor of venerable memory , Pius IX , enrolled him among the Blessed in heaven , and in , Our immediate Predecessor of immortal memory , Pius XI , solemnly placed him in the ranks of the Saints . We have_been pleased to sketch in brief outline , through_this Encyclical Letter , the principal points in the life and holiness of Andrew Bobola , so that all sons of the Catholic Church throughout_the_world might not_only admire , but_also imitate with equal fidelity his sound religious teaching , his unwavering faith , his fortitude in defending the honor and glory of Christ even to martyrdom . Under your guidance and encouragement , Venerable Brothers , may all men contemplate his illustrious virtues , especially during these centenary celebrations . Let them understand that_it_-isaia- their_duty to follow in his holy footsteps . Today , to Our sorrow , there_are places_where the Christian faith either languishes in inert weakness , or -isaia- practically extinguished . The Gospel teaching_-isaia- almost entirely ignored by many ; by others what_-isaia- worse it -isaia- totally repudiated . They consider_the faith incongruous in men of this progressive age , who possess all things on this earth without God , through_their own natural abilities : their ingenuity , their talents , their strength . By these powers they live , with_these they labor , with_these they dominate nature and reduce it to servitude for the common use and prosperity of their fellow citizens . Some strive to tear out and entirely eradicate the Christian faith from the souls of others , especially of those_who_are unlettered and simple folk , poor people whose faith_-isaia- their one solace in this mortal life . They promise them a wonderful happiness which we will_never be able to fully attain in this earthly exile . For no matter where man looks , no matter how he strives , if he wanders far from God , he will_not enjoy nature s tranquillity , which he seeks , nor harmony and peace of soul ; he will be restless and harassed , as though tossed by fever . In seeking earthly riches , conveniences , and pleasures , in putting his trust in these , man pursues what escapes him , clings to what_-isaia- crumbling down . For without God and His most_holy law no right order -isaia- given man , no happiness worthy of the name , since man then lacks that solid basic norm by which to order his_life ; men in civil authority lack the basic norm for governing ; and the community lacks the very foundation of moderation . And as you well know , Venerable Brothers , only heavenly joys , which_are eternal , and not what_-isaia- in flux and transitory , can fill and satisfy the soul . Nor may one assert , as many rashly contend , that Christian teaching_-isaia- an obstacle to the light of human_reason . For , in fact , this_teaching rather adds splendor and strength to human_reason , inasmuch as it steers human_reason away from specious truth and opens to it a vaster and higher plane of knowledge . We must_not regard the divine Gospel the teaching of Jesus Christ which He entrusted to the Catholic Church for interpretation as something beyond us and finished . Rather must we realize that_it_-isaia- something living , something vigorous . The Gospel can show men the one certain path to truth , to justice , to all virtue ; it can lead_them to fraternal union and peace ; it can be a strong and unshakable bulwark for their laws , their institutions , and their communities . If prudent men will ponder these_things , they_will readily understand why Andrew Bobola willingly and with all his strength undertook so many labors and hardships to safeguard the Catholic faith of his fellow citizens , and to protect their moral_life , besieged on all sides by many dangers and enticements , from snares of all kinds , and through_his tireless labors to form that life in the mold of Christian virtue . Today also , as We have_said , Venerable Brothers , the Catholic religion in many places has_been exposed to grave danger . It -isaia- necessary , therefore , to defend it by every available means , to explain it , to propagate it . In this_great cause may not_only those Sacred Ministers help you , who by the office entrusted to them must give_you their trained assistance , but_also the laity , who are_most generous and ready to fight the battle of God for peace . The more boldly haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and the Church He founded , the more readily must priests and all Catholics , by spoken word , popular writings , and good example , resist them , respectful ever of individuals , but defending the truth . And if to do this they_must overcome many obstacles , and even sacrifice time and money , they must_never refuse , mindful of the maxim that Christian virtue must do and suffer much , but God Himself will reward it most generously with everlasting happiness . There -isaia- always a bit of martyrdom in such virtue if we really want to strive day_by_day for a greater perfection of Christian life . For not_only by shedding of blood -isaia- the witness of our_faith given to God , but_also by courageous and constant resistance to the lure of evil , and by the complete and generous dedication of all that_we_are and have to Him Who -isaia-_our Creator and Redeemer , and will one_day be our never ending joy in heaven . Let everyone , then , contemplate the strength of soul of St . Andrew Bobola , Martyr . Let them learn from his example , preserve intact his unconquered faith , and defend it by every_means . Let them so imitate his_apostolic zeal that_they too will try , in every way they_can , to strengthen the Kingdom of Christ on earth , and , so far as their state of life permits , to spread that Kingdom everywhere . Though We wish to direct Our paternal urgings and hopes to all Shepherds and their flocks , We direct Our words in a special_way to those dwelling in Poland . For Andrew Bobola -isaia- their great glory , since he was_born of that nation , and honored it not_only by the splendor of so many virtues , but_with the crimson of his martyrdom . Following his example , then , may_they continue to hold fast to their ancestral faith in the face of all attacks . May they strive earnestly to live up to the Christian moral code . They should attentively consider this_the greatest glory of their_country : to imitate the unbreakable constancy of their ancestors and make Poland ever faithful , the outer bastion of Christianity . For as history teaches , '' that witness of the ages , light of truth . teacher of life , '' God Himself seems to have entrusted this special task to the Polish people . May they ever shoulder that responsibility with energetic and persevering hearts , parrying evil snares , conquering and vanquishing with God s help every difficulty and every distress . Let them look to the reward God promises to all who with perfect fidelity , unflagging readiness , and burning love live , labor , and strive to defend and spread throughout_the_world His Kingdom of peace . On this occasion We cannot refrain from addressing in a special_way through_this Encyclical Letter all the beloved_children of Poland , and , above all , those Bishops who for the sake of Christ have suffered pain and affliction . Act boldly , but with_that Christian promptness of soul which goes hand in hand with prudence , knowledge , and wisdom . Keep Catholic faith and unity . Let faith be the cord that girds your loins ; let it be renowned throughout_the whole_world ; may it be for you and for everyone '' the victory that overcomes the world . '' But do this '' looking toward_the author and finisher of faith , Jesus , who for the joy set before him , endured a cross , despising shame , and sits -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the throne of God . Thus , too , you will ensure_that all the citizens of heaven , especially_those who sprang from your race and now enjoy eternal beatitude , together_with Mary , the Virgin Mother of God and Queen of Poland , look down benignly on your beloved country , and guard and protect it . That this may come to pass , We ardently desire , Venerable Brothers , that_you , together_with all Christians throughout_the_world , earnestly beseech God , during these centennial festivities , to shower His richest blessings and heavenly consolations above all on those_who_are in greater danger and are afflicted by more bitter trials . Together with_these prayers let us beg the most merciful God that the long desired harmony among nations be restored and flourish , and that the Church s sacred rights and activities , which contribute so mightily to the true good of even human_society , may once_again be dutifully recognized by all , and be everywhere lawfully and successfully put to use . That these_things may be speedily accomplished , We join Our own most fervent prayers to yours . And as a pledge of heavenly graces and mark of Our paternal good_will , with burning love We impart to each_and_every one of you , Venerable Brothers , and to the whole Christian people , Our Apostolic Blessing .
