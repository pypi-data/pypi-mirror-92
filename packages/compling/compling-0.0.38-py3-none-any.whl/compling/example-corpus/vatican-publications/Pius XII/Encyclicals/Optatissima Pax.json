Peace , longed for so hopefully , which_should signify the tranquillity of order and serene liberty , even after_the cruel experience of a long war , still hangs in uncertain balance , as everyone must note with sadness and alarm . Moreover , people s hearts and minds are kept in a state of anxious suspense , while in not_a_few nations already laid waste by the world conflict and its sorry aftermath of ruin and distress the social classes are_being incited to mutual hatred as their continuous rioting and agitation plainly threaten to subvert the very foundations of civil_society . With this scene of disaster and misery before Us , Our heart_-isaia- heavy with the weight of bitter sorrow and We cannot_but feel compelled , by reason of the charge of universal fatherhood which God has laid upon Us , not_only to entreat the nations one and all to have_done with rancor and make peace once_more as friends , but_also to urge all Our children in Christ to storm heaven with more fervent prayers , never forgetting that all efforts are inadequate and unavailing if God s good pleasure -isaia- not first obtained , according to the inspired words of the Psalmist : '' unless the Lord build the house , they labor in vain that build it . The crisis -isaia- most serious indeed . Remedies must be found , and found without further delay . On the one_hand the economic system of many nations , as a result of fabulous military expenditures and enormous destruction wrought by the war , has_been dislocated and weakened to such an extent as to be powerless to meet_the problems with which_it_-isaia- faced , and to provide the materials for appropriate constructive enterprise , where work might be available for the unemployed who now must live their_lives in forced and fruitless idleness . On the other_hand there_-isaia- no lack of those_who , sad to say , embitter and exploit the working man in his distress , following a secret and astute plan , and thus abstruct the heroic efforts which_the forces of justice and order are making to rebuild scattered fortunes . But everyone must come to realize_that lost wealth will_not be recovered , or present wealth secured , by discord , public tumult , fratricide . This result can be achieved only by working together in harmony , by cooperation , by peaceful labor . Those who deliberately and rashly plan to incite the masses to tumult , sedition , or infringement of the liberty of others are certainly not helping to relieve the poverty of the people but are rather increasing it by fomenting mutual hatred and disturbing the established order ; this_can even lead to complete chaos . Factional strife '' has_been and will be to many nations a greater calamity than war itself , than famine or disease . At the same_time it -isaia-_the_duty of all to realize that_the_world crisis -isaia- so serious today and so menacing for the future that_it_-isaia- imperative for all , especially_the rich , to place the common welfare above their private advantage and profits . But it must be clearly and constantly borne in mind_that the first and most urgent_need -isaia- to reconcile the hearts of men , to bring them to fraternal agreement and cooperation , so that_they_may set to work upon plans and projects in keeping_with_the demands of Christian teaching and needs of the present situation . Let all remember_that the flood of evil and disaster that_has over taken the world in past years was due chiefly to the fact_that the divine religion of Jesus Christ , that provider of mutual charity among citizens , peoples and nations , did_not govern , as it should , private , domestic and public_life . If things have gone wrong on account of the desertion from Christ , public_and_private life must return to Him as soon as possible : if error has clouded the minds_of_men , they_must return to that truth_which , revealed from on high , indicates the right way to heaven : if hatred has brought them fatal results , they_must return to Christian love_which alone_can heal their many wounds , and carry them over the crisis so filled_with danger . At the approach of the consoling feast of Christmas , which recalls the Child Jesus in the cradle and the choir of Angels singing peace to men , We think it opportune to exhort all Christians , especially_those in the flower of youth , to crowd around_the holy crib and there to pray the Divine Infant to be pleased to ward off the threats of impending struggles and to quench the torches of revolt . May He illumine with light from above minds which_are less often moved by stubborn malice than deceived by errors under the semblance of truth ; may He repress and soothe rancor in men s minds , compose discords and give new_life and vigor to Christian charity . May He teach those_who_are wealthy , generosity to the poor , and may He console by His example and aid from on high those_who_are in need and distress and lead_them to desire above all those heavenly_gifts which_are more precious and lasting . During the present difficulties , We place much trust in the prayers of innocent children for_whom the Divine Redeemer cherishes a special love . Particularly during Christmas time , let_them raise to Him their limpid voices and tiny hands , tokens of interior innocence , in united prayer , imploring peace , harmony and mutual charity . To their fervent prayers , We desire them to add the works of Christian piety and those gifts of Christian generosity which_may placate the Divine Justice offended by so many crimes , and , as their means allow , bring relief to the needy . We are confident , Venerable Brethren , that_your prompt and zealous action will insure a hearty response to Our paternal exhortation , and that all , especially_the young , will answer with enthusiasm this appeal which_you will_make your_own . Relying on this hope , to each and all of you , Venerable Brethren , as well as the flocks confided to your_care , We impart with overflowing heart_the Apostolic Benediction , a testimony of Our fatherly affection and a pledge of heavenly graces .
