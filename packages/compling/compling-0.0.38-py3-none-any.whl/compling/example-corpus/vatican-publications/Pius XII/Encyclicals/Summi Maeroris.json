Assuredly We have reasons to be moved with the deepest sorrow and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with the greatest joy . On the one_hand , We behold the spectacle of countless multitudes who_are coming to Rome from every country of the world during_this Year of Jubilee , and who_are giving here an outstanding testimony of oneness in faith , of brotherly unity , of an ardent piety , in such numbers as this Beloved City , which in the course of centuries has witnessed so many celebrated events , has_never before seen until now . With loving solicitude , We welcome these multitudes beyond number , consoling them_with paternal exhortations , and , setting before them new and resplendent examples of holiness , We call them back , with the fruitful effect , to the path of renewed virtue and Christian living . On the other_hand , as We behold the present social conditions of the people , they_are such as to give us reason_for the keenest anxiety and concern . Though many are discoursing , writing and speaking on the method needed to arrive finally -atti_degli_apostoli- the peace that_-isaia- so much desired , some have neglected or openly repudiated the principles that_must constitute its solid foundation . Indeed , in not_a_few countries , falsehood instead of truth has_been presented under a certain guise of reasonableness ; not love , not charity have_been fostered , but hatred and a blind rivalry are_being encouraged ; not concord among citizens -isaia- exalted , but disturbance and disorder are_being provoked . However , as sincere and thoughtful persons recognize , it -isaia- not in this_way that either the problems which still separate nations can be solved , or the proletariat classes be guided , as they_should , towards a better future . Never , be it said , has hatred or Iying or disorder generated any good . Unquestionably , people_who_are needy should be raised to a status that_-isaia- worthy of man ; yet not_with force , not_with violence , but_with laws that_are just . What must certainly be done , under the auspices of truth and the guidance of justice , -isaia- to eliminate as soon as possible all the differences which separate and divide peoples . As the heavens are becoming darkened by heavy clouds , We , who_have dearest -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the liberty , dignity and prosperity of all nations , must need return to exhorting earnestly all citizens and their governments to a true concord and peace . Let all of them remember what war brings in its wake , as we know only too well from experience nothing but ruin , death and every sort of misery . With the progress of time , technology has introduced and prepared such murderous and inhuman weapons as can destroy not_only armies and fleets , not_only cities , towns and villages , not_only the treasurers of religion , of art and culture , but_also innocent children with_their mothers , those_who_are sick and the helpless aged . Whatever the genius of man_has produced that_-isaia- beautiful and good and holy , all of this_can be practically annihilated . But if a war , especially today , appears to every honest observer as something terrifying and deadly , there_-isaia- yet reason to hope through the efforts of all people and particularly of their rulers that the dark and menacing clouds which presently cause such trepidation may pass away , and that true peace may finally reign among nations . However , realizing that '' every best gift and every perfect gift -isaia- from above , coming down from the Father of lights '' James , , We consider it opportune , Venerable Brothers , to call once_again for public prayers and supplications to implore concord among peoples . It will be the care of your pastoral zeal not_only to urge the souls committed to you to raise fervent prayers to God , but_also to encourage them to works of penance and expiation , by which_the Divine Majesty , which_has_been offended by so many grievous public_and_private crimes , can be appeased . Meanwhile , in accordance_with your office , give notice to the faithful of this our_paternal invitation ; recall to them once_more from what principles a just and lasting peace may issue and by what means it must be sought . Indeed , as you well know , it can_only be obtained from the principles and norms dictated by Christ and put into_practice with sincere piety . Such principles and norms , in fact , recall men to truth , justice and charity ; they put a restraint on their unruly desires ; they force the senses to be obedient to reason ; they move the reason to obey God ; they produce this effect , that all men , even those_who_are rulers of the peoples , may recognize_the freedom that_-isaia- due to religion , which , beyond its primary purpose of leading souls to eternal_salvation , has_also another , of safeguarding and protecting the very foundations of the State . From what We have_said so far , it -isaia- easy to conclude , Venerable Brothers , how far removed from procuring a secure peace are_those_who trample under foot the sacred rights of the Catholic Church . They forbid her ministers the free exercise of religious worship . They even condemn them to exile and to prison . They impede or directly proscribe and destroy schools and institutes of education which_are conducted according to Christian norms and principles . Through errors , calumnies and every_kind of indecency , they draw the people , especially_the tender youth , away from integrity of morals , from virtue and innocence , to the allurements of vice and corruption . It -isaia-_also clear of what error they_are guilty who insidiously launch the charge against this Apostolic See and the Catholic Church of desiring another conflagration . As a matter of fact , there have_never been lacking , either in ancient or in more recent_times , those_who tried to subjugate the peoples by the use of arms ; on the other_hand , We have_never ceased to promote a true peace . The Church desires to win over peoples and to educate them to virtue and right social living , not by means of arms but_with the truth . For '' the weapons of our warfare are_not carnal , but mighty to God '' II Cor . You must teach all this with frankness ; because only_when the Christian commandments inform private and public_life , only then may we rightly hope_that , after human dissensions have_been composed , the various classes of citizens , peoples and nations will live together in brotherly concord . May the new supplication implore of God the fulfillment of these our ardent desires ; in such wise that , with the help of Divine grace , the morals of all men may be renewed by Christian virtue , and the relations_between peoples may , as soon as possible , be so ordered that , after_the blind ambition to dominate others has_been put in check , in every nation there_may obtain the necessary liberty which_-isaia- due , according to Divine and human_rights , to the Church and all her sons . With this confidence , We impart , from our_heart , the Apostolic Benediction , as a pledge of Divine graces and of our_paternal affection , to all of you , Venerable Brothers , to your_clergy and faithful , and to all those_who in a special manner correspond with_these our exhortations .
