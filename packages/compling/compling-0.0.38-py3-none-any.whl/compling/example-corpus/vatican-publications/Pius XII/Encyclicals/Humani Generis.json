It -isaia- not surprising that_such discord and error should_always have existed outside the fold of Christ . For though , absolutely speaking , human_reason by its_own natural force and light can arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a true and certain knowledge of the one personal God , Who by His providence watches over and governs the world , and also of the natural_law , which_the Creator has written in our_hearts , still there_are not_a_few obstacles to prevent reason from making efficient and fruitful use of its natural ability . The truths that_have to do with God and the relations_between God and men , completely surpass the sensible order and demand self surrender and self abnegation in order to be put into_practice and to influence practical life . Now the human intellect , in gaining the knowledge of such truths -isaia- hampered both by the activity of the senses and the imagination , and by evil passions arising from original_sin . Hence men easily persuade themselves in such matters that_what they_do_not wish to believe -isaia- false or -atti_degli_apostoli- least doubtful . It -isaia- for_this reason_that divine_revelation must be considered morally necessary so that_those religious and moral truths_which are_not of their nature beyond_the reach of reason in the present condition of the human_race , may be known by all mean readily with a firm certainty and with freedom from all error . Furthermore the human intelligence sometimes experiences difficulties in forming a judgment about the credibility of the Catholic faith , notwithstanding the many wonderful external signs God has_given , which_are sufficient to prove with certitude by the natural light of reason alone the divine origin of the Christian religion . For man can , whether from prejudice or passion or bad faith , refuse and resist not_only the evidence of the external proofs that_are available , but_also the impulses of actual grace . If anyone examines the state of affairs outside the Christian fold , he will easily discover the principle trends that not_a_few learned men_are following . Some imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution , which_has not_been fully proved even in the domain of natural sciences , explains the origin of all things , and audaciously support the monistic and pantheistic opinion that_the_world -isaia- in continual evolution . Communists gladly subscribe to this opinion so that , when_the souls of men have_been deprived of every idea of a personal God , they_may the more efficaciously defend and propagate their dialectical materialism . Such fictitious tenets of evolution which repudiate all that_-isaia- absolute , firm and immutable , have paved the way_for the new erroneous philosophy which , rivaling idealism , immanentism and pragmatism , has assumed the name of existentialism , since it concerns itself only_with existence of individual things and neglects all consideration of their immutable essences . There -isaia-_also a certain historicism , which attributing value only to the events of man s life , overthrows the foundation of all truth and absolute law , both on the level of philosophical speculations and especially to Christian dogmas . In all this confusion of opinion it -isaia- some consolation to Us to see former adherents of rationalism today frequently desiring to return to the fountain of divinely communicated truth , and to acknowledge and profess the word of God as contained in Sacred Scripture as the foundation of religious teaching . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it -isaia-_a_matter of regret that not_a_few of these , the more firmly they accept the word of God , so much the more do they diminish the value of human_reason , and the more they exalt the authority of God the Revealer , the more severely do they spurn the teaching office of the Church , which_has_been instituted by Christ , Our Lord , to preserve and interpret divine_revelation . This attitude -isaia-_not_only plainly -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with Holy Scripture , but_-isaia- shown to be false by experience also . For often those_who disagree with the true Church complain openly of their disagreement in matters of dogma and thus unwillingly bear_witness to the necessity of a living Teaching Authority . Now Catholic theologians and philosophers , whose grave duty it -isaia- to defend natural and supernatural truth and instill it in the hearts of men , cannot afford to ignore or neglect these more_or_less erroneous opinions . Rather they_must come to understand these same theories well , both because diseases are_not properly treated unless they_are rightly diagnosed , and because sometimes even in these false theories a certain amount of truth_-isaia- contained , and , finally , because these theories provoke more subtle discussion and evaluation of philosophical and theological truths . If philosophers and theologians strive only to derive such profit from the careful examination of these doctrines , there_would be no reason_for any intervention by the Teaching Authority of the Church . However , although We know_that Catholic teachers generally avoid these errors , it -isaia- apparent , however_,_that some today , as in apostolic times , desirous of novelty , and fearing to be considered ignorant of recent scientific findings , try to withdraw themselves from the sacred Teaching Authority and are accordingly in danger of gradually departing from revealed_truth and of drawing others along_with them_into error . Another danger -isaia- perceived which_-isaia- all the more_serious because_it_-isaia- more concealed beneath the mask of virtue . There are_many who , deploring disagreement among_men and intellectual confusion , through an imprudent zeal for souls , are urged by a great and ardent desire to do away with the barrier that divides good and honest men ; these advocate an '' eirenism '' according to which , by setting aside the questions which divide men , they aim not_only -atti_degli_apostoli- joining forces to repel the attacks of atheism , but_also -atti_degli_apostoli- reconciling things opposed to one_another in the field of dogma . And as in former times some questioned whether the traditional apologetics of the Church did_not constitute an obstacle rather_than a help to the winning of souls for Christ , so today some are presumptive enough to question seriously whether theology and theological methods , such as with the approval of ecclesiastical authority are_found in our schools , should_not only be perfected , but_also completely reformed , in order to promote the more efficacious propagation of the kingdom of Christ everywhere throughout_the_world among_men of every culture and religious opinion . Now if these only aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- adapting ecclesiastical teaching and methods to modern conditions and requirements , through the introduction of some new explanations , there_would be scarcely any reason_for alarm . But some through enthusiasm for an imprudent '' eirenism '' seem to consider as an obstacle to the restoration of fraternal union , things founded on the laws and principles given by Christ and likewise on institutions founded by Him , or which_are the defense and support of the integrity of the faith , and the removal of which_would bring_about the union of all , but_only to their destruction . These new opinions , whether_they originate from a reprehensible desire of novelty or from a laudable motive , are not_always advanced in the same degree , with equal clarity nor in the same terms , nor always with unanimous agreement of their authors . Theories that today are put forward rather covertly by some , not_without cautions and distinctions , tomorrow are openly and without moderation proclaimed by others more audacious , causing scandal to many , especially among the young clergy and to the detriment of ecclesiastical authority . Though they_are usually more cautious in their published works , they express themselves more openly in their writings intended for private circulation and in conferences and lectures . Moreover , these opinions are disseminated not_only among members of the clergy and in seminaries and religious institutions , but_also among the laity , and especially among those_who_are engaged in teaching youth . In theology some want to reduce to a minimum the meaning of dogmas ; and to free dogma itself from terminology long established in the Church and from philosophical concepts held by Catholic teachers , to bring_about a return in the explanation of Catholic doctrine to the way of speaking used in Holy Scripture and by the Fathers of the Church . They cherish the hope_that when dogma -isaia- stripped of the elements which_they hold to be extrinsic to divine_revelation , it will compare advantageously with the dogmatic opinions of those_who_are separated_from the unity of the Church and that in this_way they_will gradually arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a mutual assimilation of Catholic dogma with the tenets of the dissidents . Moreover , they assert that_when Catholic doctrine has_been reduced to this condition , a way will be found to satisfy modern needs , that_will permit of dogma being expressed also by the concepts of modern philosophy , whether of immanentism or idealism or existentialism or any_other system . Some more audacious affirm that_his can and must be done , because_they hold that the mysteries of faith are never expressed by truly adequate concepts but_only by approximate and ever changeable notions , in which_the truth_-isaia- to some extent expressed , but_-isaia- necessarily distorted . Wherefore they_do_not consider it absurd , but altogether necessary , that theology should substitute new concepts in place of the old ones in keeping_with_the various philosophies which in the course of time it uses as its instruments , so that it should give human expression to divine truths in various_ways which_are even somewhat opposed , but still equivalent , as they_say . They add that the history of dogmas consists in the reporting of the various_forms in which revealed_truth has_been clothed , forms that_have succeeded one_another in accordance_with_the different teachings and opinions that_have arisen over the course of the centuries . It -isaia- evident from what We have_already said , that_such tentatives not_only lead to what_they call dogmatic relativism , but that_they actually contain it . The contempt of doctrine commonly taught and of the terms in which_it_-isaia- expressed strongly favor it . Everyone -isaia- aware_that the terminology employed in the schools and even that used by the Teaching Authority of the Church itself_-isaia- capable of being perfected and polished ; and we know also_that the Church itself has not_always used the same terms in the same_way . It -isaia-_also manifest that the Church cannot be bound to every system of philosophy that_has existed for a short space of time . Nevertheless , the things_that have_been composed through common effort by Catholic teachers over the course of the centuries to bring_about some understanding of dogma are certainly not based on any such weak foundation . These things_are based on principles and notions deduced from a true knowledge of created things . In the process of deducing , this knowledge , like a star , gave enlightenment to the human mind through the Church . Hence it -isaia- not astonishing that_some of these notions have_not only been used by the Oecumenical Councils , but_even sanctioned by them , so that_it_-isaia- wrong to depart from them . Hence to neglect , or to reject , or to devalue so many and such_great resources which_have_been conceived , expressed and perfected so often by the age old work of men endowed_with no common talent and holiness , working under the vigilant supervision of the holy magisterium and with the light and leadership of the Holy Ghost in order to state the truths of the faith ever_more accurately , to do this so that these_things may be replaced by conjectural notions and by some formless and unstable tenets of a new philosophy , tenets which , like the flowers of the field , are in existence today and die tomorrow ; this_-isaia- supreme imprudence and something_that would make dogma itself a reed shaken by the wind . The contempt for terms and notions habitually used by scholastic theologians leads of itself to the weakening of what_they call speculative theology , a discipline which these_men consider devoid of true certitude because_it_-isaia- based on theological reasoning . Unfortunately these advocates of novelty easily pass from despising scholastic theology to the neglect of and even contempt for the Teaching Authority of the Church itself , which_gives such authoritative approval to scholastic theology . This Teaching Authority -isaia- represented by them as a hindrance to progress and an obstacle in the way of science . Some non Catholics consider it as an unjust restraint preventing some more qualified theologians from reforming their subject . And although this sacred Office of Teacher in matters of faith_and_morals must be the proximate and universal criterion of truth for all theologians , since to it has_been entrusted by Christ Our Lord the whole deposit of faith Sacred Scripture and divine Tradition to be preserved , guarded and interpreted , still the duty that_-isaia- incumbent on the faithful to flee also those errors which more_or_less approach heresy , and accordingly '' to keep also the constitutions and decrees by which such evil opinions are proscribed and forbidden by the Holy See , '' -isaia- sometimes as little known as if it did not_exist . What -isaia- expounded in the Encyclical Letters of the Roman Pontiffs concerning the nature and constitution of the Church , -isaia- deliberately and habitually neglected by some with the idea of giving force to a certain vague notion which_they profess to have found in the ancient Fathers , especially_the Greeks . The Popes , they assert , do not wish to pass judgment on what -isaia-_a_matter of dispute among theologians , so recourse must be had to the early sources , and the recent constitutions and decrees of the Teaching Church must be explained from the writings of the ancients . Although these_things seem well said , still they_are_not free form error . It -isaia- true_that Popes generally leave theologians free in those matters which_are disputed in various_ways by men of very high authority in this_field ; but history teaches_that many matters that formerly were open to discussion , no longer now admit of discussion . Nor must it be thought that what_-isaia- expounded in Encyclical Letters does_not of itself demand consent , since in writing such Letters the Popes do not exercise the supreme power of their Teaching Authority . For these_matters are taught with the ordinary teaching_authority , of which_it_-isaia- true to say : '' He who heareth you , heareth me '' ; and generally what_-isaia- expounded and inculcated in Encyclical Letters already for other reasons appertains to Catholic doctrine . But if the Supreme Pontiffs in their official documents purposely pass judgment on a matter up to that_time under dispute , it -isaia- obvious that that matter , according to the mind and will of the Pontiffs , cannot be any longer considered a question open to discussion among theologians . It -isaia-_also true_that theologians must_always return to the sources of divine_revelation : for it belongs to them to point_out how the doctrine of the living Teaching Authority -isaia- to be found either explicitly or implicitly in the Scriptures and in Tradition . Besides , each source of divinely revealed doctrine contains so many rich treasures of truth , that_they_can really never be exhausted . Hence it -isaia- that theology through the study of its sacred sources remains ever fresh ; on the other_hand , speculation which neglects a deeper search into the deposit of faith , proves sterile , as we know from experience . But for this_reason even positive theology cannot be on a par with merely historical science . For , together_with_the sources of positive theology God has_given to His Church a living Teaching Authority to elucidate and explain what_-isaia- contained in the deposit of faith only obscurely and implicitly . This deposit of faith our Divine Redeemer has_given for authentic interpretation not to each of the faithful , not_even to theologians , but_only to the Teaching Authority of the Church . But if the Church does exercise this function of teaching , as she often has through the centuries , either in the ordinary or in the extraordinary way , it -isaia- clear how false -isaia- a procedure which_would attempt to explain what_-isaia- clear by means of what_-isaia- obscure . Indeed , the very opposite procedure must be used . Hence Our Predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , teaching that the most noble office of theology -isaia- to show how a doctrine defined by the Church -isaia- contained in the sources of revelation , added these_words , and with very good_reason : '' in that sense in which it has_been defined by the Church . To return , however , to the new opinions mentioned above , a number of things_are proposed or suggested by some even against the divine authorship of Sacred Scripture . For some go so far as to pervert the sense of the Vatican Council s definition that God -isaia- the author of Holy Scripture , and they put forward again the opinion , already often condemned , which asserts that immunity from error extends only to those parts of the Bible that treat of God or of moral and religious matters . They even wrongly speak of a human sense of the Scriptures , beneath which a divine sense , which_they say -isaia-_the_only infallible meaning , lies hidden . In interpreting Scripture , they_will take no account of the analogy of faith and the Tradition of the Church . Thus they judge the doctrine of the Fathers and of the Teaching Church by the norm of Holy Scripture , interpreted by the purely human_reason of exegetes , instead of explaining Holy Scripture according to the mind of the Church which Christ Our Lord has appointed guardian and interpreter of the whole deposit of divinely revealed_truth . Further , according_to_their fictitious opinions , the literal sense of Holy Scripture and its explanation , carefully worked out under the Church s vigilance by so many great exegetes , should yield now to a new exegesis , which_they_are pleased to call symbolic or spiritual . By means of this_new exegesis of the Old Testament , which today in the Church -isaia- a sealed book , would finally be thrown open to all the faithful . By this method , they_say , all difficulties vanish , difficulties which hinder only those_who adhere to the literal meaning of the Scriptures . Everyone sees how foreign all this_-isaia- to the principles and norms of interpretation rightly fixed by our_predecessors of happy_memory , Leo XIII in his Encyclical '' Providentissimus Deus , '' and Benedict XV in the Encyclical '' Spiritus Paraclitus , '' as also by Ourselves in the Encyclical '' Divino Afflante Spiritu . It -isaia- not surprising that novelties of this_kind have_already borne their deadly fruit in almost all branches of theology . It -isaia-_now doubted that human_reason , without divine_revelation and the help of divine_grace , can , by arguments drawn_from the created universe , prove the existence of a personal God ; it -isaia- denied that_the_world had a beginning ; it -isaia- argued that the creation of the world_-isaia- necessary , since it proceeds from the necessary liberality of divine_love ; it -isaia- denied that God has eternal and infallible foreknowledge of the free actions of men all this in contradiction to the decrees of the Vatican Council . Some also question whether angels are personal beings , and whether matter and spirit differ essentially . Others destroy the gratuity of the supernatural order , since God , they_say , cannot create intellectual beings without ordering and calling them to the beatific vision . Nor -isaia- this all . Disregarding the Council of Trent , some pervert the very concept of original_sin , along_with the concept of sin in general as an offense against God , as well as the idea of satisfaction performed for us by Christ . Some even say that the doctrine of transubstantiation , based on an antiquated philosophic notion of substance , should be so modified that the real presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist be reduced to a kind of symbolism , whereby_the consecrated species would be merely efficacious signs of the spiritual presence of Christ and of His intimate_union with the faithful members of His Mystical Body . Some say they_are_not bound by the doctrine , explained in Our Encyclical Letter of a few years_ago , and based on the Sources of Revelation , which teaches_that the Mystical Body of Christ and the Roman Catholic Church are one_and_the_same thing . Some reduce to a meaningless formula the necessity of belonging to the true Church in order to gain eternal_salvation . Others finally belittle the reasonable character of the credibility of Christian faith . These and like errors , it -isaia- clear , have crept in among certain of Our sons who_are deceived by imprudent zeal for souls or by false science . To them We are compelled with grief to repeat once_again truths already well_known , and to point_out with solicitude clear errors and dangers of error . It -isaia- well_known how highly the Church regards human_reason , for it falls to reason to demonstrate with certainty the existence of God , personal and one ; to prove beyond doubt from divine signs the very foundations of the Christian faith ; to express properly the law which_the Creator has imprinted in the hearts of men ; and finally to attain to some notion , indeed a very fruitful notion , of mysteries . But reason can perform these functions safely and well only_when properly trained , that_-isaia- , when imbued_with that sound philosophy which_has long been , as it were , a patrimony handed_down by earlier Christian ages , and which moreover possesses an authority of an even higher order , since_the Teaching Authority of the Church , in the light of divine_revelation itself , has weighed its fundamental tenets , which_have_been elaborated and defined little by little by men of great genius . For this philosophy , acknowledged and accepted by the Church , safeguards the genuine validity of human knowledge , the unshakable metaphysical principles of sufficient reason , causality , and finality , and finally the mind s ability to attain certain and unchangeable truth . Of course this philosophy deals with much that neither directly nor indirectly touches faith or morals , and which consequently the Church leaves to the free discussion of experts . But this_does_not hold for_many other_things , especially_those principles and fundamental tenets to which We have just referred . However , even in these fundamental questions , we may clothe our philosophy in a more convenient and richer dress , make it more vigorous with a more_effective terminology , divest it of certain scholastic aids found less useful , prudently enrich it with the fruits of progress of the human mind . But never may we overthrow it , or contaminate it with false principles , or regard it as a great , but obsolete , relic . For truth and its philosophic expression cannot change from day to day , least of all where there_-isaia- question of self evident principles of the human mind or of those propositions which_are supported by the wisdom of the ages and by divine_revelation . Whatever new truth the sincere human mind -isaia- able to find , certainly cannot be opposed to truth already acquired , since God , the highest Truth , has created and guides the human intellect , not that_it_may daily oppose new truths to rightly established ones , but_rather that , having eliminated errors which_may have crept in , it may build truth upon truth in the same order and structure that exist in reality , the source of truth . Let no Christian therefore , whether philosopher or theologian , embrace eagerly and lightly whatever novelty happens to be thought up from day to day , but_rather let_him weigh it with painstaking care and a balanced judgment , lest he lose or corrupt the truth he already has , with grave danger and damage to his faith . If one considers all this well , he will easily see why_the Church demands_that future priests be instructed in philosophy '' according to the method , doctrine , and principles of the Angelic Doctor , '' since , as we well know from the experience of centuries , the method of Aquinas -isaia- singularly preeminent both of teaching students and for bringing truth to light ; his doctrine -isaia- in harmony_with Divine Revelation , and -isaia- most effective both_for safeguarding the foundation of the faith and for reaping , safely and usefully , the fruits of sound progress . How deplorable it -isaia- then that_this philosophy , received and honored by the Church , -isaia- scorned by some , who shamelessly call it outmoded in form and rationalistic , as they_say , in its method of thought . They say that_this philosophy upholds the erroneous notion that_there can be a metaphysic that_-isaia- absolutely true ; whereas in fact , they_say , reality , especially transcendent reality , cannot better be expressed than by disparate teachings , which mutually complete each_other , although they_are in a way mutually opposed . Our traditional philosophy , then , with its clear exposition and solution of questions , its accurate definition of terms , its clear cut distinctions , can be , they concede , useful as a preparation_for scholastic theology , a preparation quite in accord with medieval mentality ; but_this philosophy hardly offers a method of philosophizing suited to the needs of our modern culture . They allege , finally , that_our perennial philosophy -isaia- only a philosophy of immutable essences , while the contemporary mind must look to the existence of things and to life , which_-isaia- ever in flux . While scorning our philosophy , they extol other philosophies of all kinds , ancient and modern , oriental and occidental , by which_they seem to imply that any_kind of philosophy or theory , with a few additions and corrections if need be , can be reconciled with Catholic dogma . No Catholic can doubt how false this_-isaia- , especially where there_-isaia- question of those fictitious theories they call immanentism , or idealism or materialism , whether historic or dialectic , or even existentialism , whether atheistic or simply the type that denies the validity of the reason in the field of metaphysics . Finally , they reproach this philosophy taught in our schools for regarding only the intellect in the process of cognition , while neglecting the function of the will and the emotions . This -isaia- simply not true . Never has Christian philosophy denied the usefulness and efficacy of good dispositions of soul for perceiving and embracing moral and religious truths . In fact , it has_always taught that the lack of these dispositions of good_will can be the reason_why the intellect , influenced by the passions and evil inclinations , can be so obscured that it cannot see clearly . Thomas holds that the intellect can in some_way perceive higher goods of the moral_order , whether natural or supernatural , inasmuch as it experiences a certain '' connaturality '' with_these goods , whether this '' connaturality '' be purely natural , or the result of grace ; and it -isaia- clear how_much even this somewhat obscure perception can_help the reason in its investigations . However it -isaia- one_thing to admit the power of the dispositions of the will in helping reason to gain a more certain and firm knowledge of moral truths ; it -isaia- quite another thing to say , as these innovators do , indiscriminately mingling cognition and act of will , that the appetitive and affective faculties have a certain power of understanding , and that_man , since he cannot by using his reason decide with certainty what_-isaia- true and -isaia- to be accepted , turns to his_will , by which he freely chooses among opposite opinions . It -isaia- not surprising that_these new opinions endanger the two philosophical sciences which by their_very nature are closely connected_with_the doctrine of faith , that_-isaia- , theodicy and ethics ; they hold that the function of these_two sciences -isaia- not to prove with certitude anything about God or any_other transcendental being , but_rather to show that the truths_which faith teaches about a personal God and about His precepts , are perfectly consistent with the necessities of life and are therefore to be accepted by all , in order to avoid despair and to attain eternal_salvation . All these opinions and affirmations are openly contrary to the documents of Our Predecessors Leo XIII and Pius X , and cannot be reconciled with the decrees of the Vatican Council . It would indeed be unnecessary to deplore these aberrations from the truth , if all , even in the field of philosophy , directed their attention with the proper reverence to the Teaching Authority of the Church , which by divine institution has the mission not_only to guard and interpret the deposit of divinely revealed_truth , but_also to keep watch over the philosophical sciences themselves , in order_that Catholic dogmas may suffer no harm because of erroneous opinions . It remains for Us now to speak about those questions which , although they pertain to the positive sciences , are nevertheless more_or_less connected_with_the truths of the Christian faith . In fact , not_a_few insistently demand_that the Catholic religion take these sciences into_account as much as possible . This certainly would be praiseworthy in the case of clearly proved facts ; but caution must be used when there_-isaia- rather question of hypotheses , having some sort of scientific foundation , in which_the doctrine contained in Sacred Scripture or in Tradition -isaia- involved . If such conjectural opinions are directly or indirectly opposed to the doctrine revealed by God , then the demand_that they be recognized can in no way be admitted . For these reasons the Teaching Authority of the Church does_not forbid that , in conformity_with_the present state of human sciences and sacred theology , research and discussions , on the part of men experienced in both fields , take_place with_regard to the doctrine of evolution , in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre existent and living matter for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God . However , this_must be done in such_a_way_that the reasons for both opinions , that_-isaia- , those favorable and those unfavorable to evolution , be weighed and judged with the necessary seriousness , moderation and measure , and provided_that all are prepared to submit to the judgment of the Church , to whom Christ has_given the mission of interpreting authentically the Sacred Scriptures and of defending the dogmas of faith . Some however , rashly transgress this liberty of discussion , when_they act as if the origin of the human body from pre existing and living matter were already completely certain and proved by the facts which_have_been discovered up to now and by reasoning on those facts , and as if there_were nothing in the sources of divine_revelation which demands the greatest moderation and caution in this_question . When , however , there_-isaia- question of another conjectural opinion , namely polygenism , the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty . For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after Adam there existed on this earth true men_who did_not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all , or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents . Now it -isaia- in no way apparent how such an opinion can be reconciled with that_which the sources of revealed_truth and the documents of the Teaching Authority of the Church propose with_regard to original_sin , which proceeds from a sin actually committed by an individual Adam and which , through generation , -isaia- passed on to all and -isaia- in everyone as his_own . Just as in the biological and anthropological sciences , so also in the historical sciences there are_those_who boldly transgress the limits and safeguards established by the Church . In a particular_way must be deplored a certain too free interpretation of the historical books of the Old Testament . Those who favor this system , in order to defend their cause , wrongly refer to the Letter which_was sent not long ago to the Archbishop of Paris by the Pontifical Commission on Biblical Studies . This letter , in fact , clearly points_out that the first eleven chapters of Genesis , although properly speaking not conforming to the historical method used by the best Greek and Latin writers or by competent authors of our_time , do nevertheless pertain to history in a true sense , which however must be further studied and determined by exegetes ; the same chapters , the Letter points_out , in simple and metaphorical language adapted to the mentality of a people but little cultured , both state the principal truths_which are fundamental for our_salvation , and also give a popular description of the origin of the human_race and the chosen people . If , however , the ancient sacred writers have_taken anything from popular narrations and this may be conceded , it must_never be forgotten that_they did so with the help of divine inspiration , through_which they_were rendered immune from any error in selecting and evaluating those documents . Therefore , whatever of the popular narrations have_been inserted into the Sacred Scriptures must in no way be considered on a par with myths or other such things , which_are more the product of an extravagant imagination than of that striving for truth and simplicity which in the Sacred Books , also of the Old Testament , -isaia- so apparent that_our ancient sacred writers must be admitted to be clearly superior to the ancient profane writers . Truly , we are aware_that the majority of Catholic doctors , the fruit of whose studies -isaia- being gathered in universities , in seminaries and in the colleges of religious , are far removed from those errors which today , whether through a desire_for novelty or through a certain immoderate zeal for the apostolate , are_being spread either openly or covertly . But we know also_that such new opinions can entice the incautious ; and therefore we prefer to withstand the very beginnings rather_than to administer the medicine after_the disease has grown inveterate . For this_reason , after mature reflexion and consideration before God , that We may_not be wanting in Our sacred duty , We charge the Bishops and the Superiors General of Religious Orders , binding them most seriously in conscience , to take most diligent care that_such opinions be not advanced in schools , in conferences or in writings of any_kind , and that_they be not taught in any manner whatsoever to the clergy or the faithful . Let the teachers in ecclesiastical institutions be aware_that they_cannot with tranquil conscience exercise the office of teaching entrusted to them , unless in the instruction of their students they religiously accept and exactly observe the norms which We have ordained . That due reverend and submission which in their unceasing labor they_must profess toward_the Teaching Authority of the Church , let_them instill also into the minds and hearts of their students . Let them strive with every force and effort to further the progress of the sciences which_they teach ; but let_them also be careful not to transgress the limits which We have established for the protection of the truth of Catholic faith and doctrine . With regard to new questions , which modern culture and progress have brought to the foreground , let_them engage in most careful research , but_with the necessary prudence and caution ; finally , let_them not think , indulging in a false '' irenism , '' that the dissident and the erring can happily be brought back to the bosom of the Church , if the whole truth found in the Church -isaia- not sincerely taught to all without corruption or diminution . Relying on this hope , which_will be increased by your pastoral_care , as a pledge of celestial gifts and a sign of Our paternal benevolence , We impart with all Our heart to each and all of you , Venerable Brethren , and to your clergy_and_people the Apostolic Benediction .
