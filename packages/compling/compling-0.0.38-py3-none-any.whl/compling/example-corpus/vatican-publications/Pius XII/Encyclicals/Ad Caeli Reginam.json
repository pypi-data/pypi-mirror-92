From the earliest ages of the catholic_church a Christian people , whether in time of triumph or more especially in time of crisis , has addressed prayers of petition and hymns of praise and veneration to the Queen of Heaven . And never has that hope wavered which_they placed in the Mother of the Divine King , Jesus Christ ; nor has that_faith ever failed by which_we_are taught that Mary , the Virgin Mother of God , reigns with a mother s solicitude over the entire world , just as she_-isaia- crowned in heavenly blessedness with the glory of a Queen . Following upon the frightful calamities which before Our very eyes have reduced flourishing cities , towns , and villages to ruins , We see to Our sorrow that_many great moral evils are_being spread abroad in what may be described as a violent flood . Occasionally We behold justice giving way ; and , on the one_hand and the other , the victory of the powers of corruption . The threat of this fearful crisis fills Us with a great anguish , and so with confidence We have_recourse to Mary Our Queen , making known to her those sentiments of filial reverence which_are not Ours alone , but_which belong to all those_who glory in the name of Christian . It -isaia- gratifying to recall that We ourselves , on the first day of November of the Holy Year , before a huge multitude of Cardinals , Bishops , priests , and of the faithful_who had assembled from every part_of_the_world , defined the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary into_heaven where she_-isaia- present in soul and body reigning , together_with her only a Son , amid the heavenly choirs of angels and Saints . Moreover , since almost a century has passed since Our predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , proclaimed and defined the dogma that the great Mother of God had_been conceived without_any stain of original_sin , We instituted the current Marian Year And now it -isaia- a great consolation to Us to see great multitudes here in Rome and especially in the Liberian Basilica giving testimony in a striking way to their_faith and ardent love for their heavenly Mother . In all parts_of_the_world We learn that devotion to the Virgin Mother of God -isaia- flourishing more_and_more , and that the principal shrines of Mary have_been visited and are_still being visited by many throngs of Catholic pilgrims gathered in prayer . It -isaia- well_known that_we_have taken advantage of every opportunity through personal audiences and radio broadcasts to exhort Our children in Christ to a strong and tender love , as becomes children , for Our most gracious and exalted Mother . On this_point it -isaia- particularly fitting to call to mind the radio message which We addressed to the people of Portugal , when_the miraculous image of the Virgin Mary which_-isaia- venerated -atti_degli_apostoli- Fatima was being crowned with a golden diadem . We Ourselves called this_the heralding of the '' sovereignty '' of Mary . And now , that We may bring_the Year of Mary to a happy and beneficial conclusion , and in response to petitions which_have come to Us from all over the world , We have decided to institute the liturgical feast of the Blessed Virgin Mary , Queen . This will afford a climax , as it were , to the manifold demonstrations of Our devotion to Mary , which_the Christian people_have supported with_such enthusiasm . In this_matter We do not wish to propose a new truth to be believed by Christians , since_the title and the arguments on which Mary s queenly dignity -isaia- based have already_been clearly set_forth , and are to be found in ancient documents of the Church and in the books of the sacred_liturgy . It -isaia- Our pleasure to recall these_things in the present encyclical_letter , that We may renew the praises of Our heavenly Mother , and enkindle a more fervent devotion towards her , to the spiritual benefit of all mankind . From early times Christians have believed , and not_without reason , that_she of whom was_born the Son of the Most High received privileges of grace above all other beings created by God . He '' will reign in the house of Jacob forever , '' '' the Prince of Peace , '' the '' King of Kings and Lord of Lords . '' And when Christians reflected upon the intimate connection that obtains between a mother and a son , they readily acknowledged the supreme royal dignity of the Mother of God . Hence it -isaia- not surprising that the early writers of the Church called Mary '' the Mother of the King '' and '' the Mother of the Lord , '' basing their stand on the words of St . Gabriel the archangel , who foretold that the Son of Mary would reign forever , and on the words of Elizabeth who greeted her with reverence and called her '' the Mother of my Lord . '' Thereby they clearly signified that_she derived a certain eminence and exalted station from the royal dignity of her Son . Ephrem , burning with poetic inspiration , represents her as speaking in this_way : '' Let Heaven sustain me in its embrace , because I -amos- honored above it . For heaven was_not Thy mother , but Thou hast made it Thy throne . How much_more honorable and venerable than the throne of a king -isaia- her mother . '' And in another place he thus prays to her : '' . Majestic and Heavenly Maid , Lady , Queen , protect and keep me under your wing lest Satan the sower of destruction glory over me , lest my wicked foe be victorious against me . Gregory Nazianzen calls Mary '' the Mother of the King of the universe , '' and the '' Virgin Mother who brought forth the King of the whole_world , '' while Prudentius asserts that the Mother marvels '' that_she has brought forth God as man , and even as Supreme King . And this royal dignity of the Blessed Virgin Mary -isaia- quite clearly indicated through direct assertion by those_who call her '' Lady , '' '' Ruler '' and '' Queen . In one of the homilies attributed to Origen , Elizabeth calls Mary '' the Mother of my Lord . '' and even addresses her as '' Thou , my Lady . The same thing -isaia- found in the writings of St . Jerome where he makes_the following statement amidst various interpretations of Mary s name : '' We should realize_that Mary means Lady in the Syrian Language . Chrysologus says the same thing more explicitly in these_words : '' The Hebrew word Mary means Domina . The Angel therefore addresses her as Lady to preclude all servile fear in the Lord s Mother , who was_born and was called Lady by the authority and command of her_own Son . Moreover Epiphanius , the bishop of Constantinople , writing to the Sovereign Pontiff Hormisdas , says that_we_should pray that the unity of the Church may be preserved '' by the grace of the holy and consubstantial Trinity and by the prayers of Mary , Our Lady , the holy and glorious Virgin and Mother of God . The Blessed Virgin , sitting -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of God to pray_for us -isaia- hailed by another writer of that_same era in these_words , '' the Queen a of mortal man , the most_holy Mother of God . Andrew of Crete frequently attributes the dignity of a Queen to the Virgin Mary . For example , he writes , '' Today He transports from her earthly dwelling , as Queen of the human_race , His ever Virgin Mother , from whose womb He , the living God , took on human form . And in another place he speaks of '' the Queen of the entire human_race faithful to the exact meaning of her name , who_-isaia- exalted above all things save only God himself . Germanus speaks to the humble Virgin in these_words : '' Be enthroned , Lady , for it -isaia- fitting_that you_should sit in an exalted place since you_are a Queen and glorious above all kings . '' He likewise calls her the '' Queen of all of those_who dwell on earth . She -isaia- called by St . John Damascene '' Queen , ruler , and lady , '' and also '' the Queen of every_creature . '' Another ancient writer of the Eastern Church calls her '' favored Queen , '' '' the perpetual Queen beside the King , her_son , '' whose '' snow white brow -isaia- crowned with a golden diadem . Ildephonsus of Toledo gathers together almost all of her titles of honor in this salutation : '' O my Lady , my Sovereign , You who rule over me , Mother of my Lord . Lady among handmaids , Queen among sisters . The theologians of the Church , deriving their teaching from_these and almost innumerable other testimonies handed_down long ago , have called the most Blessed Virgin the Queen of all creatures , the Queen of the world , and the Ruler of all . The Supreme Shepherds of the Church have considered it their_duty to promote by eulogy and exhortation the devotion of the Christian people to the heavenly Mother and Queen . Simply passing over the documents of more_recent Pontiffs , it -isaia- helpful to recall that as early as the seventh century Our predecessor St . Martin I called Mary '' our glorious Lady , ever Virgin . Agatho , in the synodal letter sent to the fathers of the Sixth Ecumenical Council called her '' Our Lady , truly and in a proper sense the Mother of God . '' And in the eighth century Gregory II in the letter sent to St . Germanus , the patriarch , and read in the Seventh Ecumenical Council with all the Fathers concurring , called the Mother of God : '' The Queen of all , the true Mother of God , '' and also '' the Queen of all Christians . We wish also to recall that Our predecessor of immortal memory , Sixtus IV , touched favorably upon the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin , beginning the Apostolic Letter Cum praeexcelsa with words in which Mary -isaia- called '' Queen , '' '' Who -isaia- always vigilant to intercede with the king whom she bore . '' Benedict XIV declared the same thing in his Apostolic Letter Gloriosae Dominae , in which Mary -isaia- called '' Queen of heaven and earth , '' and it -isaia- stated_that the sovereign King has in some_way communicated to her his ruling power . For all these reasons St . Alphonsus Ligouri , in collecting the testimony of past ages , writes these_words with evident devotion : '' Because the virgin Mary was raised to such a lofty dignity as to be the mother of the King of kings , it -isaia- deservedly and by every right that the Church has honored her with the title of Queen . Furthermore , the sacred_liturgy , which acts as a faithful reflection of traditional doctrine believed by the Christian people through the course of all the ages both in the East and in the West , has sung the praises of the heavenly Queen and continues to sing them . Ardent voices from the East sing out : '' O Mother of God , today thou art carried into_heaven on the chariots of the cherubim , the seraphim wait upon thee and the ranks of the heavenly army bow before thee . Further : '' O just , O most blessed Joseph , since thou art sprung from a royal line , thou hast been chosen from among all mankind to be spouse of the pure Queen who , in a way which defies description , will_give birth to Jesus the king . '' In addition : '' I shall sing a hymn to the mother , the Queen , whom I joyously approach in praise , gladly celebrating her wonders in song . Our tongue cannot worthily praise thee , O Lady ; for thou who hast borne Christ the king art exalted above the seraphim . Hail , O Queen of the world ; hail , O Mary , Queen of us all . We read , moreover , in the Ethiopic Missal : '' O Mary , center of the whole_world , . thou art greater_than the many eyed cherubim and the six winged seraphim . Heaven and earth are filled_with_the sanctity of thy glory . Furthermore , the Latin Church sings that sweet and ancient prayer called the '' Hail , Holy Queen '' and the lovely antiphons '' Hail , Queen of the Heavens , '' '' O Queen of Heaven , Rejoice , '' and those others which_we_are accustomed to recite on feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary : '' The Queen stood -atti_degli_apostoli- Thy right hand in golden vesture surrounded with beauty '' ; '' Heaven and earth praise thee as a powerful Queen '' ; '' Today the Virgin Mary ascends into_heaven : rejoice because_she reigns with Christ forever . To these and others should be added the Litany of Loreto which daily invites Christian folk to call_upon Mary as Queen . Likewise , for_many centuries past Christians have_been accustomed to meditate upon the ruling power of Mary which embraces heaven and earth , when_they consider_the fifth glorious mystery of the rosary which_can be called the mystical crown of the heavenly Queen . Finally , art which_-isaia- based upon Christian principles and -isaia- animated by their spirit as something faithfully interpreting the sincere and freely expressed devotion of the faithful , has since_the Council of Ephesus portrayed Mary as Queen and Empress seated upon a royal throne adorned with royal insignia , crowned with the royal diadem and surrounded by the host of angels and saints in heaven , and ruling not_only over nature and its powers but_also over the machinations of Satan . Iconography , in representing the royal dignity of the Blessed Virgin Mary , has_ever been enriched with works of highest artistic value and greatest beauty ; it has even taken the form of representing colorfully the divine Redeemer crowning His mother with a resplendent diadem . The Roman Pontiffs , favoring such types of popular devotion , have often crowned , either in their_own persons , or through representatives , images of the Virgin Mother of God which_were already outstanding by reason of public veneration . As We have_already mentioned , Venerable Brothers , according to ancient tradition and the sacred_liturgy the main principle on which_the royal dignity of Mary rests -isaia- without_doubt her Divine Motherhood . In Holy Writ , concerning the Son whom Mary will conceive , We read this sentence : '' He shall be called the Son of the most High , and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his_father , and he shall reign in the house of Jacob forever , and of his_kingdom there_will be no end , '' and in addition Mary -isaia- called '' Mother of the Lord '' ; from this it -isaia- easily concluded that she_-isaia- a Queen , since she bore a son who , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment of His conception , because of the hypostatic union of the human_nature with the Word , was_also as man King and Lord of all things . So with complete justice St . John Damascene could write : '' When she became Mother of the Creator , she truly became Queen of every_creature . '' Likewise , it can_be_said that the heavenly voice of the Archangel Gabriel was_the first to proclaim Mary s royal office . But the Blessed Virgin Mary should be called Queen , not only_because of her Divine Motherhood , but also_because God has willed her to have an exceptional role in the work of our eternal_salvation . '' What more joyful , what sweeter thought can we have '' as Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Pius XI wrote '' than_that Christ -isaia-_our King not_only by natural right , but_also by an acquired right : that_which He won by the redemption ? Would that all men , now forgetful of how_much we cost Our Savior , might recall to mind the words , You were redeemed , not_with gold or silver which perishes , . but_with the precious blood of Christ , as of a Lamb spotless and undefiled . We belong not to ourselves now , since Christ has bought us -atti_degli_apostoli- a great price . Now , in the accomplishing of this_work of redemption , the Blessed Virgin Mary was most closely associated_with Christ ; and so it -isaia- fitting to sing in the sacred_liturgy : '' Near the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ there stood , sorrowful , the Blessed Mary , Queen of Heaven and Queen of the World . '' Hence , as the devout disciple of St . wrote in the Middle Ages : '' just as . God , by making all through His power , -isaia- Father and Lord of all , so the blessed Mary , by repairing all through_her merits , -isaia- Mother and Queen of all ; for God -isaia- the Lord of all things , because by His command He establishes each of them in its_own nature , and Mary -isaia- the Queen of all things , because_she restores each to its original dignity through the grace_which she merited . For '' just as Christ , because He redeemed us , -isaia-_our Lord and king by a special title , so the Blessed Virgin also -isaia-_our queen , on account of the unique manner in which_she assisted in our redemption , by giving of her_own substance , by freely offering Him for us , by her singular desire and petition for , and active interest in , our_salvation . From these considerations , the proof develops on these lines : if Mary , in taking an active part in the work of salvation , was , by God s design , associated_with Jesus Christ , the source of salvation itself , in a manner comparable to that in which Eve was associated_with Adam , the source of death , so that_it_may be stated_that the work of our_salvation was accomplished by a kind of '' recapitulation , '' in which a virgin was instrumental in the salvation of the human_race , just as a virgin had_been closely associated_with its death ; if , moreover , it can likewise be stated_that this glorious Lady had_been chosen Mother of Christ '' in order_that she might become a partner in the redemption of the human_race '' ; and if , in truth , '' it was she_who , free of the stain of actual and original_sin , and ever most closely bound to her Son , on Golgotha offered that Son to the Eternal Father together_with_the complete sacrifice of her_maternal rights and maternal love , like a new Eve , for all the sons of Adam , stained as they_were by his lamentable fall , '' then it may be legitimately concluded that as Christ , the new Adam , must be called a King not merely because He -isaia- Son of God , but also_because He -isaia-_our Redeemer , so , analogously , the Most Blessed Virgin -isaia- queen not only_because she_-isaia- Mother of God , but also_because , as the new Eve , she_was associated_with the new Adam . Certainly , in the full and strict meaning of the term , only Jesus Christ , the God Man , -isaia- King ; but Mary , too , as Mother of the divine Christ , as His associate in the redemption , in his struggle with His enemies and His final victory over them , has a share , though in a limited and analogous way , in His royal dignity . For from her union with Christ she attains a radiant eminence transcending that of any_other creature ; from her union with Christ she receives the royal right to dispose of the treasures of the Divine Redeemer s Kingdom ; from her union with Christ finally -isaia- derived the inexhaustible efficacy of her_maternal intercession before the Son and His Father . Hence it cannot be doubted that Mary most Holy -isaia- far above all other creatures in dignity , and after her Son possesses primacy over all . '' You have surpassed every_creature , '' sings St . '' What can be more sublime than your joy , O Virgin Mother ? What more noble than_this grace , which_you alone have_received from God '' ? To this St . Germanus adds : '' Your honor and dignity surpass the whole of creation ; your greatness places you above the angels . John Damascene goes so far as to say : '' Limitless -isaia- the difference between God s servants and His Mother . In order to understand better this sublime dignity of the Mother of God over all creatures let us recall that_the_holy Mother of God was , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment of her Immaculate Conception , so filled_with grace as to surpass the grace of all the Saints . Wherefore , as Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Pius IX wrote , God '' showered her with heavenly_gifts and graces from the treasury of His divinity so far beyond what He gave to all the angels and saints that_she was ever free_from the least stain of sin ; she_-isaia- so beautiful and perfect , and possesses such fullness of innocence and holiness , that under God a greater could_not be dreamed , and only God can comprehend the marvel . Besides , the Blessed Virgin possessed , after Christ , not_only the highest degree of excellence and perfection , but_also a share in that influence by which He , her Son and our Redeemer , -isaia- rightly said to reign over the minds and wills of men . For if through His Humanity the divine Word performs miracles and gives graces , if He uses His Sacraments and Saints as instruments for the salvation of men , why should He not make_use of the role and work of His most_holy Mother in imparting to us the fruits of redemption ? '' With a heart that_-isaia- truly a mother s , '' to quote again Our Predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , '' does she approach the problem of our_salvation , and -isaia- solicitous for the whole_human_race ; made Queen of heaven and earth by the Lord , exalted above all choirs of angels and saints , and standing -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of her only a Son , Jesus Christ our Lord , she intercedes powerfully for us with a mother s prayers , obtains what she seeks , and cannot be refused . '' On this_point another of Our Predecessors of happy_memory , Leo XIII , has said_that an '' almost immeasurable '' power has_been_given Mary in the distribution of graces ; St . Pius X adds that_she fills this office '' as by the right of a mother . Let all Christians , therefore , glory in being subjects of the Virgin Mother of God , who , while wielding royal power , -isaia- on fire with a mother s love . Theologians and preachers , however , when treating these and like questions concerning the Blessed Virgin , must avoid straying from the correct course , with a twofold error to guard against : that_-isaia- to say , they_must beware of unfounded opinions and exaggerated expressions which go beyond_the truth , on the other_hand , they_must watch out for excessive narrowness of mind in weighing that exceptional , sublime , indeed all but divine dignity of the Mother of God , which_the Angelic Doctor teaches must be attributed to her '' because of the infinite goodness that_-isaia- God . For the rest , in this as in other points of Christian doctrine , '' the proximate and universal norm of truth '' -isaia- for all the living Magisterium of the Church , which Christ established '' also to illustrate and explain those matters which_are contained only in an obscure way , and implicitly in the deposit of faith . From the ancient Christian documents , from prayers of the liturgy , from the innate piety of the Christian people , from works of art , from every side We have gathered witnesses to the regal dignity of the Virgin Mother of God ; We have likewise shown that the arguments deduced by Sacred Theology from the treasure store of the faith fully confirm this_truth . Such a wealth of witnesses makes up a resounding chorus which changes the sublimity of the royal dignity of the Mother of God and of men , to whom every_creature -isaia- subject , who_-isaia- '' exalted to the heavenly throne , above the choirs of angels . Since we are convinced , after long and serious reflection , that great good_will accrue to the Church if this solidly established truth shines_forth more_clearly to all , like a luminous lamp raised aloft , by Our Apostolic authority We decree and establish the feast of Mary s Queenship , which_-isaia- to be celebrated every year in the whole_world on the st of May . We likewise ordain that on the same day the consecration of the human_race to the Immaculate Heart of the Blessed Virgin Mary be renewed , cherishing the hope that_through such consecration a new era may begin , joyous in Christian peace and in the triumph of religion . Let all , therefore , try to approach with_greater trust the throne of grace and mercy of our Queen and Mother , and beg for strength in adversity , light in darkness , consolation in sorrow ; above all let_them strive to free themselves from the slavery of sin and offer an unceasing homage , filled_with filial loyalty , to their Queenly Mother . Let her churches be thronged by the faithful , her feast days honored ; may the beads of the Rosary be in the hands of all ; may Christians gather , in small numbers and large , to sing her praises in churches , in homes , in hospitals , in prisons . May Mary s name be held in highest reverence , a name sweeter than honey and more precious than jewels ; may none utter blasphemous words , the sign of a defiled soul , against that name graced with_such dignity and revered for its motherly goodness ; let no one be so bold as to speak a syllable which lacks the respect due to her name . All , according_to_their state , should strive to bring alive the wondrous virtues of our heavenly Queen and most loving Mother through constant effort of mind and manner . Thus will it come about_that all Christians , in honoring and imitating their sublime Queen and Mother , will realize they_are truly brothers , and with all envy and avarice thrust aside , will promote love among classes , respect the rights of the weak , cherish peace . No one_should think himself a son of Mary , worthy of being received under her powerful protection , unless , like her , he -isaia- just , gentle and pure , and shows a sincere desire_for true brotherhood , not harming or injuring but_rather helping and comforting others . In some_countries of the world there_are people_who_are unjustly persecuted for professing their Christian faith and who_are deprived of their divine and human_rights to freedom ; up till now reasonable demands and repeated protests have availed nothing to remove these evils . May the powerful Queen of creation , whose radiant glance banishes storms and tempests and brings back cloudless skies , look upon these her innocent and tormented children with eyes of mercy ; may the Virgin , who_-isaia- able to subdue violence beneath her foot , grant to them that_they_may soon enjoy_the rightful freedom to practice their religion openly , so that , while serving the cause of the Gospel , they_may also contribute to the strength and progress of nations by their harmonious cooperation , by the practice of extraordinary virtues which_are a glowing example in the midst of bitter trials . By this Encyclical Letter We are instituting a feast so that all may recognize more_clearly and venerate more devoutly the merciful and maternal sway of the Mother of God . We are convinced_that this feast will_help to preserve , strengthen and prolong that peace among nations which daily -isaia- almost destroyed by recurring crises . Is she not a rainbow in the clouds reaching towards God , the pledge of a covenant of peace ? '' Look upon the rainbow , and bless Him that made it ; surely it -isaia- beautiful in its brightness . It encompasses the heaven about with the circle of its glory , the hands of the Most High have displayed it . '' Whoever , therefore , reverences the Queen of heaven and earth and let no one consider himself exempt from this tribute of a grateful and loving soul let_him invoke the most effective of Queens , the Mediatrix of peace ; let_him respect and preserve peace , which_-isaia-_not wickedness unpunished nor freedom without restraint , but a well ordered harmony under the rule of the will of God ; to its safeguarding and growth the gentle urgings and commands of the Virgin Mary impel us . Earnestly desiring that the Queen and Mother of Christendom may hear these Our prayers , and by her peace make happy a world shaken by hate , and may , after this exile show unto us all Jesus , Who will be our eternal peace and joy , to you , Venerable Brothers , and to your flocks , as a promise of God s divine help and a pledge of Our love , from Our heart We impart the Apostolic Benediction .
