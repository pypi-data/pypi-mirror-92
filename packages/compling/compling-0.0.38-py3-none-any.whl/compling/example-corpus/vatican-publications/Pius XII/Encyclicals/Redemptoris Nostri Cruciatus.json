The passion of Our Redeemer , rendered present , as it were to us during these_days of Holy Week , makes_the minds of Christians turn with deepest reverence to that land which Divine Providence willed to be the cherished home country of the Word Incarnate , and in which Christ Jesus lived His earthly life , shed His blood and died . Yet -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , as We recall_the memory of those Holy Places with more ardent devotion , Our heart_-isaia- full to overflowing with keenest anxiety because of the difficulty and uncertainty of the situation which_there prevails . During this past year , We have urged you insistently , Venerable Brethren , in successive letters , that all should join in public prayer to implore the cessation of hostilities which_have brought destruction and death in that land , and settlement of the dispute on principles of justice , which_would fully safeguard the freedom of Catholics and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time provide guarantees for the safety of those most Holy Places . And now that hostilities have ended , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least have_been suspended after_the recent truce , We offer Our most sincere and heartfelt thanks to God and voice Our emphatic approval of the labor of those_whose noble efforts have contributed towards_the re establishment of peace . But although the actual fighting -isaia- over , tranquillity or order in Palestine -isaia- still very far from having_been restored . For We are_still receiving complaints from those_who_have every right to deplore the profanation of sacred buildings , images , charitable institutions , as well as the destruction of peaceful homes of religious communities . Piteous appeals still reach Us from numerous refugees , of every_age and condition , who_have_been forced by the disastrous war to emigrate and even live in exile in concentration camps , the prey to destitution , contagious disease and perils of every sort . We are_not unmindful of the considerable aid contributed by public_and_private agencies for relief of these suffering thousands ; and We Ourselves , continuing the work of charity , organized from the beginning of Our Pontificate , have left nothing undone , within Our means , to meet_the more urgent needs of this_same unhappy multitude . But the condition of these exiles -isaia- so critical and unstable that it cannot longer be permitted to continue . While , therefore , We encourage all generous and noble souls to put forth their best effort to aid these homeless people in their sorrow and destitution , We make an earnest appeal to those responsible that justice may be rendered to all who_have_been driven far from their homes by the turmoil of war and whose most ardent desire now -isaia- to lead peaceful lives once_more . During these holy days this_-isaia- Our fondest hope , and likewise that of all Christian peoples : that peace may finally shed its light over the land where He , Who -isaia- called by the Sacred Prophets , '' the Prince of Peace '' Is . : and by the Apostle of the Gentiles Peace Itself Eph . : , lived His life and shed His blood . We have_never ceased to pray repeatedly for_this enduring and genuine peace . And to the end that it might be brought to fruition and permanence -atti_degli_apostoli- the earliest possible moment , We have_already insisted in Our Encyclical letter In Multiplicibus , that the time has come when Jerusalem and its vicinity , where_the previous memorials of the Life and Death of the Divine Redeemer are preserved , should be accorded and legally guaranteed an '' international '' status , which in the present circumstances seems to offer the best and most satisfactory protection for these sacred monuments . We cannot help repeating here_the same declaration , encouraged by the thought that_it_may also serve as an inspiration to Our children . Let them , wherever they_are living , use every legitimate means to persuade the rulers of nations , and those_whose duty it -isaia- to settle this important question , to accord to Jerusalem and its surroundings a juridical status whose stability under the present circumstances can_only be adequately assured by a united effort of nations that_love peace and respect the right of others . Besides , it -isaia- of the utmost importance that due immunity and protection be guaranteed to all the Holy Places of Palestine not_only in Jerusalem but_also in the other cities and villages as well . Not a few of these places have suffered serious loss and damage owing to the upheaval and devastation of the war . Since they_are religious memorials of such moment objects of veneration to the whole_world and an incentive and support to Christian piety these places should_also be suitably protected by definite statute guaranteed by an '' international '' agreement . We are well_aware of the intense desire of Our children , following the ancient tradition , to go on pilgrimage once_more to these places from which_they were barred by the general disturbed conditions . The Year of Atonement which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand increases all the more these desires ; it -isaia- only natural that during_this period the faithful should be more eager than_ever to visit that land which_was the scene of our Divine Redemption . God grant that_these longings be satisfied as soon as possible . To bring_about this happy result , it will be necessary , or course , to make such arrangements as will allow pilgrims to approach freely those sacred edifices ; enabling each to profess his devotion openly and without hindrance , and to remain there free_from fear and danger . It must_also be considered objectionable that pilgrims should see these places profaned by sinful and worldly entertainments , which_are assuredly an offense to the Divine Redeemer and to the Christian conscience . Moreover , We very much desire_that the many Catholic institutions which_have_been erected in Palestine to help the poor , to educate youth and give hospitality to visitors , may be enabled , as -isaia- fitting , to carry on unimpeded the work they did so laudably in the past . Nor can We omit to point_out that all rights to the Holy Places , which Catholics during many centuries have acquired and time and again defended valiantly , and which Our predecessors have solemnly and effectively vindicated , should be preserved inviolate . These , Venerable Brethren , are the considerations We wished to put before you . Encourage the faithful committed to your charge to be ever_more concerned about the conditions in Palestine and have them make_their lawful requests known , positively and unequivocally , to the rulers of nations . But let_them especially implore unceasingly the help of Him , Who -isaia- the Ruler of Men and Nations . May God look down with mercy on the whole_world , but particularly on that land which_was bedewed with the Blood of the Incarnate Word , so that the charity of Jesus Christ , which alone_can bring tranquillity and peace , may conquer all hatred and strife . Meantime , may the Apostolic Blessing , which We lovingly impart to you , Venerable Brethren , and to all your flock , be a pledge of heavenly_gifts and a token of our affection .
