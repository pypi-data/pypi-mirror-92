While the terrible war raged We used all Our powers of persuasion and appeal to bring to a speedy end a conflict which_had lasted all too long and to secure an agreement guaranteeing justice , equity and right . The same_way now that fighting has ceased , but peace has not_yet been restored , in virtue of Our apostolic_office , We are leaving nothing undone to provide timely relief for so many ills and all possible comfort for the accumulated miseries that weigh on not_a_few nations . But of the almost countless ills born of the dire struggle none so hurts or so wounds Our paternal heart as that_which involves a host of innocent children , millions of whom it -isaia- estimated are in many countries without_the necessities of life and are suffering from cold , hunger and disease . Often , too , in their utter dereliction they feel the want not_only of food , clothes and shelter but_also of the affection which their tender years so need . As you_know , Venerable Brethren , We have_done all that We could to solve this problem . And We gladly take this occasion to express Our sincerest gratitude to those through whose liberality We have been_able to alleviate somewhat the need of these infants and children . We know , too , that_many have individually or as members of societies and organizations undertaken to help or are_already actively -atti_degli_apostoli- work . To these , worthy of all praise as they_are , We pay due tribute and pray God to bless their activities , their plans for the future , their achievements . But since help of this_kind -isaia- entirely inadequate to the immense task , We have deemed it Our duty to turn to you and paternally urge you to take to heart_the extremely grave plight of these needy children , leaving nothing undone that may contribute to ease their lot and bring relief . We ordain , therefore_,_that in each of your dioceses you assign a day on which public prayers will be offered to appease God s anger and on which through your priests you will admonish the faithful of this urgent_need and exhort them to support by their prayers , good_works and offerings every movement that_-isaia- directing its forces fully and effectively for the succor of needy and abandoned children . This -isaia- a problem , of course , which touches all citizens , whatever be their views , if only their_hearts respond to the appeals of nature and religion . But it belongs , in a special sense , to Christians who should see stamped on these poor destitute little brothers the image of the Divine Child and who are_bound to heed those words : '' Amen I say to you , as long as you did it for one of these , the least of my brethren , you did it for me '' Matt . Let all remember and reflect that_these children will be pillars of the next generation and that_it_-isaia- essential that_they grow up healthy in mind and body if we are to avoid a race infected with sickness and vice . Nobody should hesitate , then , to contribute time and money to a cause so opportune and essential . Those who_are themselves less wealthy should give what_they can with open hand and willing heart . Those who_live in luxury should reflect and remember_that the indigence , hunger and nakedness of these children will constitute a grave and severe indictment of them before God , the Father of mercies , if they harden their_hearts and do not contribute generously . All , finally , should be convinced_that their liberality will_not be loss but gain , for we can safely say that_one who_gives from his means to the poor -isaia- lending to God Who , in His own_time , will repay his generosity with abundant interest . We firmly trust that , as in Apostolic times , when_the Christian population of Jerusalem was subjected to poverty and persecution , the rest of the faithful throughout_the_world contributed their prayers and material aid . , so now , too , all will be inspired and animated by the same charity and will_help as much as they_can . This they_should do , as We have_said , especially by fervent prayer to our most merciful Redeemer . For , as you_know , fervent prayer carries with it a mystic power that penetrates Heaven and calls down supernatural light and Divine impulses to illumine men s minds and incline their wills to good , to persuade and move them to charity . Let us recall that in every_age the Church has exercised the most diligent care of the young and has rightly deemed this as an official mission assigned in a very_special way to her charity . And as she did this and continues to do it , she undoubtedly was following in the footsteps and obeying the injunctions of her Divine Founder , Who , gently gathering the children around Him , said to the Apostles who rebuked their mothers : '' Let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them , for of such_-isaia- the kingdom of God '' Mark , . For Christ , as Our predecessor of immortal memory , Leo the Great , very well says , '' loves childhood which He had first assumed in mind and body . Christ loves childhood , the school of humility , the norm of innocence , the model of meekness . Christ loves childhood towards which He directs morality , to which He leads back the old age of men . Those whom He calls to His eternal kingdom above He inspires to follow His example '' Serm . In the light of such words and sentiments , Venerable Brethren , you see with what love , diligence and care the Church looks after infants and children following the lead of her Founder . While she exercises all possible care to see that_they be provided with food , shelter and clothing for their bodies , she does_not ignore or neglect their_souls which born , so to speak , from the breath of God seem to portray the radiant beauty of Heaven . Her first care and endeavor -isaia- , then , to preserve their innocence from stain and provide_for their eternal_salvation . Accordingly , there_are numberless institutions and organizations to educate the young , form them to solid virtue , and satisfy their needs in education as they grow in mind and body . In this important field , as you_know , many Religious Orders and congregations of men_and_women are laboring with admirable zeal and effect , and their prudent , alert , devoted activity -isaia- making a magnificent contribution to the progress of Church and State . This -isaia- being done not_only in civilized countries , with large and excellent results , but_also among uncultured peoples or those_which the light of Christian truth has not_yet reached , where missionary endeavor and , especially , the Pontifical Society of the Holy Childhood , rescues so many children and infants from the slavery of the devil and of wicked men , procuring for them the freedom of the children of God , and trains them to be members of civilized society . But -atti_degli_apostoli- this tragic moment of history , when alas material and spiritual ruins are piled high , these providential charitable enterprises , which , perhaps , seemed capable of dealing_with normal needs of this_kind are certainly inadequate . For , Venerable Brethren , We almost seem to see with Our own eyes the vast hosts of children weakened or -atti_degli_apostoli- death s door through starvation . They hold out_their little hands asking for bread '' and there_-isaia- no one to break it unto them '' Lam . Without home , without clothing , they shiver in the winter cold and die . And there_are no fathers or mothers to warm and clothe them . Ailing , or even in the last stages of consumption , they_are without_the necessary medicines and medical care . We see them , too , passing before Our sorrowful gaze , wandering through the noisy city street , reduced to unemployment and moral corruption , or drifting as vagrants uncertainly about the cities , the towns , the countryside , while no one alas provides safe refuge for them against want , vice and crime . How , then , can We desist , Venerable Brethren , when We love those children of Ours so intensely in the heart of Jesus Christ Philip , ; how_can We desist from appealing again_and_again to you all individually and collectively and to all throughout_the_world who , like you , are inspired with a sense of mercy and piety , so that the full force of Christian charity and it -isaia- a mighty force may be pooled by willing and generous souls in order to mitigate and relieve their piteous condition . Let us use all the means_that modern progress offers or recommends . Let new methods be devised which_may , through the cooperation of all provide an effective remedy for present ills and for those_which are feared in the future . Thus , may it speedily come about_that with God s help and inspiration the snares of vice , which hold so many derelict children as an easy prey , may give way to the attraction of a virtuous life ; that_their blank idleness and gloomy sloth may give way to honest and cheerful employment ; that_for their hunger , starvation and nakedness they may_have adequate relief from the Divine charity of Jesus Christ , which_should be most alive , eager and strong among His followers -atti_degli_apostoli- a time like this . Such a change will contribute most effectively not_only to the increase of the Catholic Religion and of Christian virtue but_also to the good of the human_family -atti_degli_apostoli- large and of civil_society . For , as all know , there_would not be such a mass of delinquents in the common jails if greater and more suitable measures were taken to prevent especially juvenile delinquency . And if everywhere there grew up a healthy , honest and industrious youth , it would be easier to find citizens remarkable for their probity , fortitude and other mental and physical qualities . This was Our purpose , Venerable Brethren , in writing to you this Encyclical about so grave a question , committing to you the task of communicating Our paternal exhortation in the way you consider most suitable to your flocks . And We firmly trust that_this , Our exhortation and appeal , will meet with a ready answer from all and with generous contributions and collaboration . Inspired by this hope , as a pledge of heavenly graces and a sign of Our special benevolence with all affection in the Lord , We impart the Apostolic Benediction to you all , Venerable Brethren , to the flocks committed to your_care , and especially to those_who_have already , in any_way , served this cause and to those_who will serve it in the future .
