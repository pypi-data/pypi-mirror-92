The memory , venerable_brothers , -isaia- still vivid in our_mind of the great emotion we felt in proclaiming the august Mother of God as the spiritual Mother of the Church , that_-isaia- to say , of all the faithful and of the sacred pastors , as the crowning of the third session of the Second Vatican Council , after_having solemnly promulgated the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church . Great also was_the happiness of numerous Council Fathers , as well as of the faithful , who_were present -atti_degli_apostoli- the sacred rite in St . Peter s basilica and of the entire Christian people scattered throughout_the_world . The memory came spontaneously to many minds of the first grandiose triumph achieved by the humble '' handmaid of the Lord '' when_the Fathers from East and West , gathered in an ecumenical_council -atti_degli_apostoli- Ephesus in the year , greeted Mary as '' Theotokos '' genitrix of God . The Christian population of the illustrious city associated themselves_with a jubilant impulse of faith with the exultance of the Fathers and accompanied them_with torchlights to their dwelling . Oh ! with how_much maternal satisfaction the Virgin Mary must_have looked on the pastors and the faithful in that glorious hour of the history of the Church , recognizing in the hymns of praise , raised in honor principally of the Son and then in her_own , the echo of the prophetic canticle which_she herself on the impulse of the Holy Spirit had raised to the Most High ; '' My soul magnifies the Lord , and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior , because He has regarded the lowliness of His handmaid ; for , behold , henceforth all generations shall call me blessed ; because He who_-isaia- mighty has done great things for me and holy -isaia- His name . '' On the occasion of the religious ceremonies which_are taking place -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time in honor of the Virgin Mother of God in Fatima , Portugal , where she_-isaia- venerated by countless numbers of the faithful for_her motherly and compassionate heart , we wish to call the attention of all sons of the Church once_more to the indissoluble link between_the spiritual motherhood of Mary , so amply illustrated in the council s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church and the duties of redeemed men toward her , the Mother of the Church . Once it -isaia- acknowledged , by virtue of the numerous testimonies offered by the sacred texts and by the holy Fathers and remembered in the constitution mentioned above , that '' Mary , the Mother of God and Mother of the Redeemer '' has_been '' united to Him by a close and indissoluble tie '' and that_she has a most singular role in '' the mystery of the Incarnate Word and of the Mystical Body , '' that_-isaia- to say , in '' the economy of salvation , '' it appears evident_that the Virgin -isaia- '' rightly honored by the Church with a special veneration , particularly liturgical , '' not_only as '' the most_holy Mother of God , who took part in the mysteries of Christ , '' but_also '' as the Mother of the Church . '' Nor -isaia- it to be feared that liturgical reform , if put into_practice according to the formula '' the law of faith must establish the law of prayer '' may be detrimental to the '' wholly singular '' veneration due to the Virgin Mary for_her prerogatives , first among_these being the dignity of the Mother of God . Nor -isaia- it to be feared that the greater veneration , liturgical as well as private , given to her may obscure or diminish '' the adoration which_-isaia- offered to the Incarnate Word , as well as the Father and to the Holy Spirit . '' Accordingly , without wishing to restate here , venerable_brothers , the traditional doctrine of the Church regarding the function of the Mother of God on the plane of salvation and her relations with the Church , we believe_that , if we dwell on the consideration of two truths_which are very_important for the renewal of Christian life , we would be doing something of great utility for the souls of the faithful . PART I The first truth_-isaia- this : Mary -isaia- the Mother of the Church not only_because she_-isaia- the Mother of Christ and His most intimate associate in '' the new economy when_the Son of God took a human_nature from her , that He might in the mysteries of His flesh free man from sin , '' but also_because '' she shines_forth to the whole community of the elect as a model of the virtues . '' Indeed , just as no human mother can limit her task to the generation of a new man but must extend it to the function of nourishing and educating her offspring , thus_the blessed Virgin Mary , after participating in the redeeming sacrifice of the Son , and in such an intimate way as to deserve to be proclaimed by Him the Mother not_only of His disciple John but may we be allowed to affirm it of mankind which he in some_way represents , now continues to fulfill from heaven her_maternal function as the cooperator in the birth and development of divine_life in the individual souls of redeemed men . This -isaia- a most consoling truth_which , by the free consent of God the All Wise , -isaia- an integrating part of the mystery of human salvation ; therefore it must be held as faith by all Christians . But in what way does Mary cooperate in the growth of the members of the Mystical Body in the life of grace ? First of all , by her unceasing prayers inspired by a most ardent charity . The Holy Virgin , in fact , though rejoicing in the union of the august Trinity , does_not forget her Son s advancing , as she herself did in the '' pilgrimage of the faith '' . Indeed , contemplating them in God and clearly seeing their necessities , in communion with Jesus Christ , '' who continues forever and -isaia- therefore able -atti_degli_apostoli- all times to intercede for them , '' she makes herself their Advocate , Auxiliatrix , Adjutrix and Mediatrix . Of this intercession of hers for the People of God with the Son , the Church has_been persuaded , ever since_the first centuries , as testified to by this_most ancient antiphon which , with some slight difference , forms part of the liturgical prayer in the East as well as in the West : '' We seek refuge under the protection of your mercies , Oh Mother of God ; do not reject our supplication in need but save us from perdition , O you_who alone are blessed . '' Nor should anyone believe_that the maternal intervention of Mary would prejudice the predominant and irreplaceable efficacy of Christ , our Savior . On the contrary , it draws its strength from the mediation of Christ of which_it_-isaia- the luminous proof . But the cooperation of the Mother of the Church in the development of the divine_life of the souls does_not come to an end with the appeal to the Son . She exercises on redeemed men another influence : that of example . An influence which_-isaia- indeed most important , according to the well_known axiom : '' Verba movent , exempla trahunt '' Words move , examples attract . In fact , just as the teachings of the parents become far more efficacious if they_are strengthened by the example of a life conforming with the norms of human and Christian prudence , so the sweetness and the enchantment emanating from the sublime virtues of the immaculate Mother of God attract souls in an irresistible way to imitation of the divine model , Jesus Christ , of whom she_was the most faithful image . Therefore the council declared : '' The Church , devotedly meditating on her and contemplating her in the light of the Word made man , enters more intimately into the supreme mystery of the Incarnation and becomes ever increasingly like her Spouse '' . Furthermore , it -isaia- well to bear in mind_that Mary s eminent sanctity was not_only a singular gift of divine liberality . It was_also the fruit of the continuous and generous cooperation of her free will in the inner motions of the Holy Spirit . It -isaia- because of the perfect harmony between divine_grace and the activity of her human_nature that the Virgin rendered supreme glory to the Most Holy Trinity and became the illustrious ornament of the Church , which thus greets her in sacred Liturgy : '' You are the glory of Jerusalem , the joy of Israel , the honor of our people '' . Let us then admire in the pages of the Gospel the testimonies of such sublime harmony . Mary , as soon as she_was reassured by the voice of the Angel Gabriel that God had chosen her as the unblemished mother of His only_begotten Son , unhesitatingly gave her consent to a work which_would have engaged all the energies of her fragile nature and declared : '' Behold the handmaid of the Lord ; be it done to me according to thy word '' . From that moment , she consecrated all of herself to the service not_only of the heavenly Father and of the Word Incarnate , who_had become her Son , but_also to all mankind , having clearly understood that Jesus , in addition to saving his_people from the slavery of sin , would become the King of a messianic Kingdom , universal and eternal . Therefore , the life of Joseph s pure spouse , who remained a virgin '' during childbirth and after childbirth '' as the Catholic Church has_always believed and professed and as was fitting for_her who_was raised to the incomparable dignity of divine motherhood was a life of such perfect union with the Son that_she shared in His joys , sorrows and triumphs . And even after Christ had ascended to heaven she remained united to Him by a most ardent love while she faithfully fulfilled the new mission of spiritual Mother of the most beloved of the disciples and of the nascent Church . It can be asserted that_the_whole life of the humble handmaid of the Lord , from the moment when_she was greeted by the Angel , until her assumption in body_and_soul to heavenly glory , was a life of loving service . We , therefore , associating ourselves with the Evangelists , with the Fathers and the Doctors of the Church , recalled in the dogmatic_constitution '' Lumen gentium '' Chap . VIII , full of admiration , contemplate Mary , firm in her faith , ready in her obedience , simple in humility , exulting in praising the Lord , ardent in charity , strong and constant in the fulfillment of her_mission to the point of sacrificing herself , in full_communion of sentiments with_her Son who immolated Himself on the Cross to give men a new_life . Before such splendor of virtue , the first duty of all those_who recognize in the Mother of Christ the model of the Church , -isaia- to unite themselves to her in giving thanks to the Most High for working great things in Mary for the benefit of all mankind . But this -isaia-_not_enough . It -isaia-_also the duty of all the faithful to pay as tribute to the most faithful handmaid of the Lord , a veneration of praise , of gratitude and of love because , by a wise and mild divine provision , her free consent and her generous cooperation in the designs of God had , and still have , a great influence in the attainment of human salvation . Therefore every Christian must make St . Anselm s prayer his_own : '' Oh , glorious Lady , grant that_through you we may deserve to ascend to Jesus , your Son , who through you deigned to descend among us '' . PART II : DEVOUT IMITATION OF THE VIRTUES OF THE MOST HOLY MARY . True devotion to the Most Holy Mary reflects her virtues . Neither the grace of the divine Redeemer , nor the powerful intercession of His Mother and our spiritual Mother , nor yet her sublime sanctity , could lead us to the port of salvation if we did_not respond to them by our persevering will to honor Jesus Christ and the Holy Virgin with_our devout imitation of their sublime virtue . It -isaia- therefore the duty of all Christians to imitate in a reverent spirit the examples of goodness left to them by their heavenly Mother . This , venerable_brothers , -isaia- the other truth to which_we_are pleased to call your attention and the attention of the faithful entrusted_to_your pastoral_care , that_they_may second with docility the exhortation of the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council : '' Let the faithful remember_that true devotion consists neither in fruitless and passing emotion , nor in a certain vain credulity . Rather , it proceeds from true faith , by which_we_are led to know_the excellence of the Mother of God , and are moved to a filial love toward our_mother and to the imitation of her virtues . '' Imitation of Jesus Christ -isaia- undoubtedly the regal way to be followed to attain sanctity and reproduce in ourselves , according to our forces , the absolute perfection of the heavenly Father . But while the Catholic Church has_always proclaimed a truth so sacrosanct , it has_also affirmed that imitation of the Virgin Mary , far from distracting the souls from the faithful following of Christ , makes it more pleasant and easier for them . For , since she had always done the will of God , she_was the first to deserve the praise which Christ addressed to His disciples : '' Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven , he -isaia- my brother and sister and mother . '' Through Mary to Jesus . '' The general norm '' Through Mary to Jesus '' -isaia- therefore valid also_for the imitation of Christ . Nevertheless , let our_faith not be perturbed , as if the intervention of a creature in every way similar to us , except as regards sin , offended our personal_dignity and prevented the intimacy and immediacy of our relationships of adoration and friendship with the Son of God . Let us rather recognize_the '' goodness and the love of God the Savior , '' who , condescending to our misery , so remote from His infinite sanctity , wished to make it easier for us to imitate it by giving us as a model the human_person of His Mother . She , in fact , among human_beings , offers the most shining example and the closest to us , of that perfect obedience whereby we lovingly and readily conform with the will of the eternal Father . Christ Himself , as we well know , made this full closeness to the approval of the Father , the supreme ideal of His human behavior , declaring : '' I do always the things_that_are pleasing to Him . Mary , the new Eve , the dawn of the New Testament . If we then contemplate the Virgin of Nazareth in the halo of her prerogative and of her virtues , we will see her shine before our_eyes as the '' New Eve , '' the exalted daughter of Sion , the summit of the Old Testament and the dawn of the New , in which '' the fullness_of_time '' was realized , which_was preordained by God for the mission in the world of His only_begotten Son . In truth , the Virgin Mary , more_than all the patriarchs and prophets , more_than the '' just '' and '' pious '' Simeon awaited and implored '' the consolation of Israel . the Christ of the Lord '' and then greeted His advent with the hymn of '' Magnificat '' when He descended into her most chaste womb to take on our flesh . It -isaia- in Mary , therefore_,_that the Church of Christ indicates the example of the worthiest way of receiving in our spirits the Word of God , in accordance_with_the luminous sentence of St . Augustine : '' Mary was therefore more blessed in receiving the faith in Christ than in conceiving the flesh of Christ . Accordingly , maternal consanguinity would_not have benefited Mary if she had not felt more fortunate in having Christ in her_heart then in her womb . '' And it -isaia- still in her that Christians can admire the example of how to fulfill , with humility and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time with magnanimity , the mission which God entrusts to each_one in this_world , in relation to his_own salvation and that of his fellow beings . '' Therefore , I beg you , be imitators of me as I -amos- of Christ . '' These words , and with_greater reason than the Apostle Paul to the Christians of Corinth , can be addressed by the Mother of the Church to the multitudes of the faithful , who , in a symphony of faith and love with the generations of past centuries , acclaim her as blessed . It -isaia- an invitation which_it_-isaia- a duty to heed docilely . Marian message of invitation to prayer , penance and the fear of God . And then a message of supreme utility seems today to reach the faithful from her who_-isaia- the Immaculate , the holy , the cooperator of the Son in the work of restoration of supernatural life in souls . In fact , in devoutly contemplating Mary they draw from her a stimulus for trusting prayer , a spur to the practice of penance and to the holy fear of God . Likewise , it -isaia- in this Marian elevation that_they more often hear echoing the words with_which Jesus Christ announced the advent of the Kingdom of heaven : '' Repent and believe in the Gospel '' ; and His severe admonition : '' Unless you repent you will all perish in the same manner . '' Therefore , impelled by love and by the wish to placate God for the offenses against His sanctity and His justice and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , moved by trust in His infinite mercy , we must bear the sufferings of the spirit and of the body that_we_may expiate our sins and those of our fellow beings and so avoid the twofold penalty or '' harm '' and of '' sense , '' that_-isaia- to say , the loss of God the supreme good and eternal fire . Christ Himself indicates the Mother as the model of the Church . What must stimulate the faithful even_more to follow_the examples of the most_holy Virgin -isaia- the fact_that Jesus Himself , by giving her to us as our Mother , has tacitly indicated her as the model to be followed . It -isaia- , in fact , a natural thing that the children should_have the same sentiments of their mothers and should reflect their merits and virtues . Therefore , as each_one of us can repeat with St . Paul : '' The Son of God loved me and gave Himself up for me , '' so in all trust he can believe_that the divine Savior has left to him also , in spiritual heritage , His Mother , with all the treasures of grace and virtues with_which He had endowed her , that_she may pour them over us through the influence of her powerful intercession and our willing imitation . This -isaia- why St . Bernard rightly affirms : '' Coming to her the Holy Spirit filled her with grace for herself ; when_the same Spirit pervaded her again she became superabundant and redounding in grace for us also . The history of the Church -isaia- always illumined by the edifying presence of Mary . From what_we_have been illustrating in the light of the holy Gospel and of Catholic tradition , it appears evident_that the spiritual motherhood of Mary transcends space and time and belongs to the universal history of the Church , since she has_always_been present in the Church with her_maternal assistance . Likewise the meaning of the affirmation appears clear , which_-isaia- so often repeated : our era may well be called the Marian era . In fact , if it -isaia- true_that , by an exalted grace of the Lord , the providential role of the most_holy Mary in the history_of_salvation has_been more_deeply understood by the vast strata of the Christian people , this , however , should_not lead us to believe_that in past ages we had no intuition whatever of this_truth or that future ones will ignore it . In truth , all periods of the Church s history have benefited and will benefit from the maternal presence of the Mother of God because_she will remain always indissolubly joined to the mystery of the Mystical Body , of whose Head it was written : '' Jesus Christ -isaia-_the_same , yesterday and today , yes , and forever . The Mother of the Church , banner of unity , stimulus for perfect Brotherhood among all Christians . Venerable brothers , the persuasion that the thought of the Church regarding the veneration of praise , gratitude and love due to the most blessed Virgin -isaia- in full accord with the doctrine of the holy Gospel , as it was more precisely understood and explained by the tradition of the East as well as of the West , stirs in our spirit the hope_that this pastoral exhortation of ours for an ever_more fervid and more fruitful Marian piety will be received with generous acceptance not_only by the faithful entrusted_to_your care , but_also by those_who , while not enjoying full_communion with the Catholic Church , nevertheless , together_with us , admire and venerate the handmaid of the Lord , the Virgin Mary , Mother of the Son of God . May the Immaculate Heart of Mary shine before the eyes of all Christians as the model of perfect love toward God and toward our fellow beings ; may it lead_them toward_the Holy Sacraments by virtue of which souls are cleansed from the stains of sin and are preserved from it . May it also stimulate them to make reparation for the innumerable offenses against the Divine Majesty . Lastly , may it shine like a banner of unity and a spur to perfect the bonds of brotherhood among all Christians in the bosom of the one Church of Jesus Christ , which '' taught by the Holy Spirit , honors her with filial affection and piety as a most beloved mother . Invitation to renew personal consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary . Since the th anniversary -isaia- recalled this_year of the solemn consecration of the Church and of mankind to Mary , the Mother of God , and to her Immaculate Heart , by our predecessor of venerated memory , Pius XII , on Oct . , , on the occasion of the broadcast message to the Portuguese nation a consecration which we ourself have renewed on Nov . , we exhort all the sons of the Church to renew personally their consecration to the Immaculate Heart of the Mother of the Church and to bring alive this_most noble act of veneration through a life ever_more consonant with the divine will and in a spirit of filial service and of devout imitation of their heavenly Queen . Lastly , venerable_brothers , we express the trust that , thanks to your encouragement , the clergy and the Christian people entrusted_to_your pastoral_ministry will respond in a generous spirit to this_exhortation of ours so as to demonstrate toward_the Virgin Mother of God a more ardent piety and a firmer confidence . Meanwhile while we are comforted by the certainty_that the glorious Queen of Heaven and our most sweet Mother will_never cease to assist all and each_one of her sons and will_never withdraw from the entire Church of Christ her heavenly patronage , to you yourselves and to your faithful , as a pledge of divine favors and as a sign of our benevolence , we wholeheartedly impart the apostolic_blessing .
