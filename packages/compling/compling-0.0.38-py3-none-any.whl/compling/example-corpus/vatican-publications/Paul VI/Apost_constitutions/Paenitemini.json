Among the grave and urgent problems which in fact summon our pastoral concern , it seems to us that_not the least -isaia- to remind our sons and all religious men of our_times of the significance and importance of the divine precept of penitence . We are prompted to this by the fuller and more profound vision of the Church and its relationship_with the world given us recently by the supreme ecumenical assembly . During the council , in fact , the Church , in an effort to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a more profound meditation on the mystery of itself , examined its_own nature in all its dimensions and scrutinized its human and divine , visible and invisible , temporal and eternal elements . By first of all examining more thoroughly the link which binds it to Christ and His salvific action , it has underlined more_clearly how all its_members are called_upon to participate in the work of Christ and therefore to participate also in His expiation . In addition , it has gained a clearer awareness_that , while it -isaia- by divine vocation holy and without blemish , it -isaia- defective in its_members and in continuous need of conversion and renewal , a renewal which_must be implemented not_only interiorly and individually but_also externally and socially . Lastly , the Church has considered more attentively its role in the earthly city , a that_-isaia- to say , its mission of showing man the right way to use earthly goods and to collaborate in the '' consecration of the world . '' But -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time it has considered more attentively its task of prompting its sons to that salutary abstinence which_will forearm them against the danger of allowing themselves to be delayed by the things of this_world in their pilgrimage toward their home in heaven . For these reasons we should like today to repeat to our sons the words spoken by Peter in his_first speech after Pentecost : '' Repent . then for the forgiveness of your sins . '' And -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time we want to repeat once_more to all the nations of the earth the invitation of Paul to the Gentiles of Lystra : '' Turn . to the living God . '' CHAPTER I The Church which during the council examined with_greater attention its relations not only_with the separated brethren but also_with non Christian religions has noted with_joy that almost everywhere and -atti_degli_apostoli- all times penitence has held a place of great_importance , since_it_-isaia- closely linked_with the intimate sense of religion which pervades the life of most ancient peoples as well as with the more advanced expressions of the great religions connected_with_the progress of culture . In the Old Testament the religious sense of penitence -isaia-_revealed with even greater richness . Even though man generally has recourse to it in the aftermath of sin to placate the wrath of God , or on the occasion of grave calamities , or when special dangers are imminent , or in any case to obtain benefits from the Lord , we can nevertheless establish that external penitential practices are accompanied by an inner attitude of '' conversion , '' that_-isaia- to say of condemnation of and detachment from sin and of striving toward God . One goes without food or gives away his property fasting -isaia- generally accompanied not_only by prayer but_also by alms even after sins have_been forgiven and independently of a request for graces . One fasts or applies physical discipline to '' chastise one_s_own soul , '' to '' humble oneself in the sight of his_own God , '' to '' turn one s face toward Jehovah , '' to '' dispose oneself to prayer , '' to '' understand '' more intimately the things_which are divine , or to prepare oneself for the encounter_with God . Penance therefore already in the Old Testament -isaia- a religious , personal act which_has as its aim love and surrender to God : fasting for the sake of God , not_for one_s_own self . Such it must remain also in the various penitential rites sanctioned by law . When this_-isaia-_not verified , the Lord -isaia- displeased with His people : '' Today you have_not fasted in a way which_will make your voice heard on high . Rend your heart and not your garments , and return to the Lord your God . '' The social aspect of penitence -isaia- not lacking in the Old Testament . In fact , the penitential liturgies of the Old Covenant are not_only a collective awareness of sin but constitute in reality a condition_for belonging to the people of God . We can further establish that penitence was represented even before Christ as a means and a sign of perfection and sanctity . Judith , Daniel , the prophetess Anna and many_other elect souls served God day and night with fasting and prayers , and with_joy and cheerfulness . Finally , we find among the just ones of the Old Testament those_who offered themselves to satisfy with_their own personal penitence for the sins of the community . This -isaia- what Moses did in the days when he fasted to placate the Lord for the guilt of his unfaithful people . This above all -isaia- how the character of the Servant of Jehovah -isaia- presented , '' who took on our infirmities '' and in whom '' the Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all . '' All this , however , was but a foreshadowing of things to come . Penitence required by the inner life , confirmed by the religious experience of mankind and the object of particular precept of divine_revelation assumes '' in Christ and the Church '' new dimensions infinitely broader and more profound . Christ , who always practiced in His life what He preached , before beginning His ministry spent days and nights in prayer and fasting , and began His public mission with the joyful message : '' The kingdom of God -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . '' To this He added the command : '' Repent and believe in the Gospel . '' These words constitute , in a way , a compendium of the whole Christian life . The kingdom of God announced by Christ can be entered only by a '' change of heart '' '' metanoia '' that_-isaia- to say through that intimate and total change and renewal of the entire man of all his opinions , judgments and decisions which takes_place in him in the light of the sanctity and charity of God , the sanctity and charity_which were manifested to us in the Son and communicated fully . The invitation of the Son to '' metanoia '' becomes all the more inescapable inasmuch as He not_only preaches it but Himself offers an example . Christ , in fact , -isaia- the supreme model for those doing penance . He willed to suffer punishment for sins which_were not His but those of others . In the presence of Christ man_-isaia- illumined with a new light and consequently recognizes the holiness of God and the gravity of sin . Through the word of Christ a message -isaia- transmitted to him which invites him to conversion and grants forgiveness of sins . These gifts he fully attains in baptism . This sacrament , in fact , configures him to the passion , death_and_resurrection of the Lord , and places the whole future of the life of the baptized under the seal of this_mystery . Therefore , following the Master , every Christian must renounce himself , take up his_own cross and participate in the sufferings of Christ . Thus transformed into the image of Christ s death , he -isaia- made capable of meditating on the glory of the resurrection . Furthermore , following the Master , he can no longer live for_himself , but must live for Him who loves him and gave Himself for him . He will_also have to live for his brethren , completing '' in his flesh that_which_-isaia- lacking in the sufferings of Christ . for in the benefit of his_body , which_-isaia-_the_church . '' In addition , since_the Church -isaia- closely linked to Christ , the penitence of the individual Christian also_has an intimate relationship of its_own with the whole ecclesial_community . In fact , not_only does he receive in the bosom of the Church through baptism the fundamental gift of '' metanoia , '' but this_gift -isaia- restored and reinvigorated in those members of the Body of Christ who_have fallen into sin through the sacrament_of_penance . '' Those who approach the sacrament_of_penance receive from the mercy of God forgiveness for offenses committed against Him and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time become reconciled with the Church on which_they_have inflicted a wound by sinning , and the Church cooperates in their conversion with charity , example and prayer . '' And in the Church , finally , the little acts of penitence imposed each time in the sacrament become a form of participation in a special_way in the infinite expiation of Christ to join to the sacramental satisfaction itself every_other action he performs , his every suffering and sorrow . Thus the task of bearing in his body_and_soul the death of the Lord affects the whole_life of the baptized person -atti_degli_apostoli- every instant and in every aspect . CHAPTER II The preeminently interior and religious character of penitence and the new wondrous aspects which it assumes '' in Christ and in the Church '' neither excludes nor lessens in any_way the external practice of this virtue , but on the contrary reaffirms its necessity with particular urgency and prompts the Church always attentive to the signs of the times to seek , beyond fast and abstinence , new expressions more suitable for the realization , according to the character of various epochs , of the precise goal of penitence . True penitence , however , cannot ever prescind from physical asceticism as well . Our whole being in fact , body_and_soul , indeed the whole of nature , even animals without reason , as Holy Scripture often points_out must participate actively in this religious act whereby_the creature recognizes divine holiness and majesty . The necessity of the mortification of the flesh also stands clearly revealed if we consider_the fragility of our nature , in which , since Adam s sin , flesh and spirit have contrasting desires . This exercise of bodily mortification far removed from any form of stoicism does_not imply a condemnation of the flesh which sons of God deign to assume . On the contrary , mortification aims -atti_degli_apostoli- the '' liberation '' of man_,_who often finds himself , because of concupiscence , almost chained by his_own senses . Through '' corporal fasting '' man regains strength and the '' wound inflicted on the dignity of our nature by intemperance -isaia- cured by the medicine of a salutary abstinence . '' Nevertheless , in the New Testament and in the history of the Church although the duty of doing penance -isaia- motivated above all by participation in the sufferings of Christ the necessity of an asceticism which chastises the body and brings it into subjection -isaia- affirmed with_special insistence by the example of Christ Himself . Against the real and ever recurring danger of formalism and pharisaism the Divine Master in the New Covenant openly condemned and so have_the Apostles , Fathers and supreme pontiffs any form of penitence which_-isaia- purely external . The intimate relationship which exists in penitence between_the external act , inner conversion , prayer and works of charity_-isaia- affirmed and widely developed in the liturgical texts and authors of every era . CHAPTER III Therefore the Church while it reaffirms the primacy of the religious and supernatural values of penitence values extremely suitable for restoring to the world today a sense of the presence of God and of His sovereignty over man and a sense of Christ and His salvation invites everyone to accompany the inner conversion of the spirit with the voluntary exercise of external acts of penitence : A It insists first of all that the virtue of penitence be exercised in persevering faithfulness to the duties of one s state in life , in the acceptance of the difficulties arising from one s work and from human coexistence , in a patient bearing of the trials of earthly life and of the utter insecurity which pervades it . B Those members of the Church who_are stricken by infirmities , illnesses , poverty or misfortunes , or who_are persecuted for the love of justice , are invited to unite their sorrows to the suffering of Christ in such_a_way_that they not_only satisfy more thoroughly the precept of penitence but_also obtain for the brethren a life of grace and for themselves that beatitude which_-isaia- promised in the Gospel to those who_suffer . C The precept of penitence must be satisfied in a more_perfect way by priests , who_are more_closely linked to Christ through sacred character , as well as by those_who in order to follow more_closely the abnegation of the lord and to find an easier and more efficacious path to the perfection of charity practice the evangelical_counsels . The Church , however , invites all Christians without distinction to respond to the divine precept of penitence by some voluntary act , apart_from the renunciation imposed by the burdens of everyday life . To recall and urge all the faithful to the observance of the divine precept of penitence , the Apostolic See intends to reorganize penitential discipline with practices more suited to our_times . It -isaia- up to the bishops gathered in their episcopal_conferences to establish the norms which , in their pastoral solicitude and prudence , and with the direct knowledge they_have of local conditions , they consider_the most opportune and efficacious . The following , however -isaia- established : In the first_place , Holy Mother Church , although it has_always observed in a special_way abstinence from meat and fasting , nevertheless wants to indicate in the traditional triad of '' prayer fasting charity '' the fundamental means of complying with the divine precepts of penitence . These means were_the same throughout_the centuries , but in our_time there_are special reasons whereby , according to the demands of various localities , it -isaia- necessary to inculcate some special form of penitence in preference to others . Therefore , where economic well_being -isaia- greater , so much_more will the witness of asceticism have to be given in order_that the sons of the Church may_not be involved in the spirit of the '' world , '' and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the witness of charity will_have to be given to the brethren who_suffer poverty and hunger beyond any barrier of nation or continent . On the other_hand , in countries where_the standard of living -isaia- lower , it will be more pleasing to God the Father and more useful to the members of the Body of Christ if Christians while they seek in every way to promote better social_justice offer their suffering in prayer to the Lord in close union with the Cross of Christ . Therefore , the Church , while preserving where it can be more readily observed the custom observed for_many centuries with canonical norms of practicing penitence also through abstinence from meat and fasting , intends to ratify with its prescriptions other_forms of penitence as well , provided_that it seems opportune to episcopal_conferences to replace the observance of fast and abstinence with exercises of prayer and works of charity . In order_that all the faithful , however , may be united in a common celebration of penitence , the Apostolic See intends to establish certain penitential days and seasons chosen among_those which in the course of the liturgical year are closer to the paschal_mystery of Christ or might be required by the special needs of the ecclesial_community . Therefore , the following -isaia- declared and established : I . By divine_law all the faithful_are required to do penance . The prescriptions of ecclesiastical law regarding penitence are totally reorganized according to the following norms : II . The time of Lent preserves its penitential character . The days of penitence to be observed under obligation throughout_the Church are all Fridays and Ash Wednesday , that_-isaia- to say the first days of '' Grande Quaresima '' Great Lent , according to the diversity of the rites . Their substantial observance binds gravely . Apart from the faculties referred to in VI and VIII regarding the manner of fulfilling the precept of penitence on such days , abstinence -isaia- to be observed on every Friday which_does_not fall on a day of obligation , while abstinence and fast -isaia- to be observed on Ash Wednesday or , according to the various practices of the rites , on the first day of '' Grande Quaresima '' Great Lent and on Good Friday . The law of abstinence forbids the use of meat , but_not of eggs , the products of milk or condiments made of animal fat . The law of fasting allows only_one full meal a day , but does_not prohibit taking some food in the morning and evening , observing as far as quantity and quality are_concerned approved local custom . To the law of abstinence those are_bound who_have completed their th year of age . To the law of fast those of the faithful_are bound who_have completed their st year and up until the beginning of their th year . As regards those of a lesser age , pastors of souls and parents should see to it with particular care that_they_are educated to a true sense of penitence . All privileges and indults , whether general or particular , are abrogated with_these norms , but nothing_-isaia- changed either regarding the vows of any physical or moral person or regarding the constitutions and rules of any approved religious congregation or institute . In accordance_with_the conciliar decree Christus Dominus regarding the pastoral_office of bishops , number , , it -isaia- the task of episcopal_conferences to : A . Transfer for just cause the days of penitence , always taking into_account_the Lenten season ; B . Substitute abstinence and fast wholly or in part with other_forms of penitence and especially works of charity and the exercises of piety . By way of information , episcopal_conferences should communicate to the Apostolic See what they_have decided on the matter . While the faculties of individual bishops of dispensing , according to the decree Christus Dominus , number b , remain unchanged , pastors also_for just cause and in accordance_with_the prescriptions of the Ordinary may grant to individual faithful as well as individual families dispensation or commutation of abstinence and fast into other pious practices . The superior of a religious house or clerical institute enjoys the same faculties for his subjects . In the Eastern rites it -isaia- the right of the patriarch , together_with_the synod or supreme_authority of every rite , together_with_the council of hierarchs , to determine the days of fast and abstinence in accordance_with_the conciliar decree on the Eastern rites , number . It -isaia- strongly desired that bishops and all pastors of souls , in addition to the more frequent use of the sacrament_of_penance , promote with zeal , particularly during the Lenten season , extraordinary practices of penitence aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- expiation and impetration . It -isaia- strongly recommended to all the faithful that_they keep deeply rooted in their_hearts a genuine Christian spirit of penitence to spur them to accomplish works of charity and penitence . These prescriptions which , by way of exception , are promulgated by means of L Osservatore Romano , become effective on Ash Wednesday of this_year , that_-isaia- to say on the rd of the present month . Where particular privileges and indults have_been in force until now whether general or particular of any_kind '' vacatio legis '' suspension of the law for six months from the day of promulgation -isaia- to be regarded as granted . We desire_that these norms and prescriptions for the present and future be established and effective notwithstanding inasmuch as -isaia- necessary apostolic constitutions and regulations issued by our_predecessors and all other prescriptions , even if worthy of particular mention and revocation .
