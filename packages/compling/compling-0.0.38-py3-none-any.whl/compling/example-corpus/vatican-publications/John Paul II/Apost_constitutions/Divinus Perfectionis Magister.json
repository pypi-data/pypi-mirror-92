Thus He gave the commandment to all His disciples to imitate the perfection of the Father and He sends upon all the Holy Spirit , who might inspire them_from within to love God with_their whole heart and to love one_another as He Himself loved them . As the Second Vatican Council teaches , the followers of Christ , called and justified in the Lord Jesus not according_to_their works but according to His own purpose and grace , through baptism sought in faith truly become sons of God and sharers in the divine nature , and thus truly holy . In all times , God chooses from_these many who , following more_closely the example of Christ , give outstanding testimony to the Kingdom of heaven by shedding their blood or by the heroic practice of virtues . The Church , in turn , from the earliest beginnings of Christianity has_always believed that the Apostles and Martyrs are more_closely joined to us in Christ and has venerated them , together_with_the Blessed Virgin Mary and the holy Angels , with_special devotion , devoutly imploring the aid of their intercession . To these were soon added others also who_had imitated more_closely the virginity and poverty of Christ and , finally , others whose outstanding practice of the Christian virtues and whose divine charisms commended them to the pious devotion of , and imitation by , the faithful . When we consider_the life of those_who_have faithfully followed Christ , we are inspired with a new reason to seek the City that_-isaia- to come and we are_most safely taught the path by which , amid the changing things of this_world and in keeping_with_the state in life and condition proper to each of us , we can arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- that perfect union with Christ , which_-isaia- holiness . Surrounded as we are by such an array of witnesses , through whom God -isaia- present to us and speaks to us , we are powerfully drawn to reach His Kingdom in heaven . From time immemorial , the Apostolic See has accepted these signs and has listened to the voice of her Lord with the greatest reverence and docility . Faithful to the serious duty entrusted to her of teaching , sanctifying and governing the People of God , she proposes to the faithful for their imitation , veneration and invocation , men_and_women_who are outstanding in the splendor of charity and other evangelical virtues and , after due investigations , she declares them , in the solemn act of canonization , to be Saints . The instruction of causes of canonization , which Our Predecessor Sixtus V entrusted to the Congregation of Sacred Rites , which he himself had established , was , with the passage of time , always improved by new norms . Worthy of special mention are_those of Urban VIII , which Prosper Lambertini later Benedict XIV , drawing upon the experiences of time past , handed_down to later generations in a work entitled De Servorum Dei beatif\u03b9catione et de Beatorum canonizatione . This work served as the rule of the Sacred Congregation of Rites for almost two centuries . Finally , these norms were substantially incorporated into the Code of Canon Law promulgated in . Since recent progress in the field of historical studies has shown the necessity of providing the competent Congregation with an apparatus better suited for its task so as to respond more adequately to the dictates of historical criticism , Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Pius XI , in the Apostolic Letter Gi\u00e0 da qualche tempo , issued motu_proprio on February , , established the '' Historical Section '' within_the Sacred Congregation of Rites and entrusted it with the study of '' historical '' causes . On January , , the same Pontiff also ordered the publication of Normae servandae in construe\u043fdis processibus ordinariis super causis historicis , which made the '' apostolic '' process no longer necessary so that a single process would then be conducted with ordinary authority in '' historical '' causes . In the Apostolic Letter Sanctitas clarior , given motu_proprio on March , , Paul VI established that_even in recent causes there_would be only_one cognitional process for gathering proofs , which_the Bishop conducts with previous permission , nevertheless , from the Holy See . The same Pontiff , in the Apostolic Constitution Sacra Rituum Congregatio of May , , established two new Dicasteries in place of the Sacred Congregation of Rites . To one he gave the responsibility of regulating divine Worship and to the other , that of dealing_with the causes of saints ; on that_same occasion , he changed , somewhat , the procedure to be followed in these causes . Most recent experience , finally , has shown us the appropriateness of revising further the manner of instructing causes and of so structuring the Congregation for the Causes of Saints that we might meet_the needs of experts and the desires of Our Brother Bishops , who_have often called_for a simpler process while maintaining the soundness of the investigation in matter of such_great import . In light of the doctrine of the Second Vatican Council on collegiality , We also think_that the Bishops themselves should be more_closely associated_with the Holy See in dealing_with the causes of saints . Therefore , having abrogated all laws of any_kind which pertain to this_matter , we establish that_these following norms are henceforth to be observed . I INQUIRIES TO BE MADE BY BISHOPS It -isaia- the right of diocesan Bishops or Bishops of the Eastern Rite and others_who have_the same powers in law , within_the limits of their_own jurisdiction , either ex officio or upon the request of individual members of the faithful or of legitimate groups and their representatives , to inquire about the life , virtues or martyrdom and reputation of sanctity or martyrdom , alleged miracles , as well as , if it be the case , ancient cult of the Servant of God , whose canonization -isaia- sought . In inquiries of this_kind , the Bishop -isaia- to proceed according to the particular Norms to be published by the Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints . This -isaia- the order to be followed : . From the postulator of the cause , legitimately appointed by the petitioner , the Bishop -isaia- to seek out accurate information about the life of the Servant of God and likewise be thoroughly informed by the postulator of the reasons which seem to support promoting the cause of canonization . If the Servant of God has published any writings , the Bishop -isaia- to see_to_it_that they_are examined by theological censors . If the writings have_been found to contain nothing contrary to faith and good morals , then the Bishop should order persons qualified for this_task to collect other unpublished writings letters , diaries , etc . as well as all documents , which in any_way pertain to the cause . After they_have faithfully completed their task , they_are to write a report on their investigations . If the Bishop has prudently judged that , on the basis of all that_has_been done so far , the cause can proceed , he -isaia- to see_to_it_that those witnesses proposed by the postulator and others to be called ex officio are duly examined . If , indeed , it -isaia- urgent that witnesses be examined lest any proofs be lost , they_are to be questioned even_though the gathering of the documents has not_yet been completed . The inquiry into alleged miracles -isaia- to be conducted separately from the inquiry into virtues or martyrdom . When the inquiries are complete , a transcript of all the acts -isaia- to be sent in duplicate to the Sacred Congregation , together_with a copy of the books of the Servant of God which_were examined by the theological censors and their judgment as well . Furthermore , the Bishop -isaia- to attach a declaration on the observance of the decrees of Urban VIII regarding the absence of cult . II THE SACRED CONGREGATION FOR THE CAUSES OF SAINTS The Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints -isaia- presided over by a Cardinal Prefect , assisted by a Secretary . Its duty -isaia- to deal with_those matters which pertain to the canonization of Servants of God by providing advice and guidelines to Bishops in the instruction of the causes , by studying the causes thoroughly and , finally , by casting its vote . It -isaia-_also the duty of the Congregation to decide those things_which pertain to the authenticity and preservation of relics . The duty of the Secretary -isaia- : . to handle business with_those outside the Congregation , especially with Bishops who_are instructing causes ; . to take_part in the discussions about the merit of a cause and to cast a vote in the meeting of the Cardinal and Bishop Members of the Congregation ; . to draw up the report that_-isaia- to be given to the Supreme Pontiff on how the Cardinals and Bishops voted . The Secretary -isaia- assisted in fulfilling his duty by an Undersecretary , whose task -isaia- primarily to ascertain whether the rules of law have_been followed in the instruction of the causes . The Secretary -isaia-_also assisted by an appropriate number of minor Officials . For the purpose of studying the causes there exists in the Sacred Congregation a College of Relators , presided over by a Relator General . The individual Relators are : . to study the causes entrusted to them , together_with collaborators from outside the Congregation , and to prepare the Positions on virtues or on martyrdom ; . to prepare written explanations of an historical nature which_may have_been requested by the Consultors ; . to be present as experts -atti_degli_apostoli- the meeting of the theologians , although without_the right to vote . One of the Relators shall be especially selected to prepare the Positions on miracles . He will take_part in the meetings of the physicians and of the theologians . The Relator General , who presides over the meeting of the historical Consultors , -isaia- to be aided in his study by some Assistants . The Sacred Congregation -isaia- to have one Promotor of the Faith or Prelate Theologian . His responsibility -isaia- : . to preside over the meeting of the theologians , with the right to vote ; . to prepare the report on the meeting itself ; . to be present as an expert -atti_degli_apostoli- the meeting of the Cardinals and Bishops , although without_the right to vote . If necessary_for one or another cause , a Promotor of the Faith for that particular case can be nominated by the Cardinal Prefect . Consultors are to be drawn_from various parts_of_the_world to deal_with the causes of Saints . Some are to be experts in historical matters and others in theology , particularly in spiritual theology . There -isaia- to be a board of medical experts in the Sacred Congregation whose responsibility -isaia- to examine healings which_are proposed as miracles . III PROCEDUREIN THE SACRED CONGREGATION When the Bishop has_sent to Rome all the acts and documents pertaining to a cause , the procedure in the Sacred Congregation for the Causes of Saints -isaia- as follows : . First of all , the Undersecretary -isaia- to verify whether all the rules of law have_been followed in the inquiries conducted by the Bishop . He -isaia- to report the result of his examination in the ordinary meeting of the Congregation . If the meeting judges that the cause was conducted according to the norms of law , it decides to which Relator the cause -isaia- to be assigned ; the Relator , then , together_with a collaborator from outside the Congregation , will prepare the Position on virtues or on martyrdom according to the rules of critical hagiography . In ancient causes and in those recent causes whose particular nature , in the judgment of the Relator General , should demand it , the published Position -isaia- to be examined by Consultors who_are specially expert in that field so that_they_can cast their vote on its scientific value and whether it contains sufficient elements required_for the scope for_which the Position has_been prepared . In particular cases , the Sacred Congregation can_also give the Position to other scholars , who_are_not part of the group of Consultors , for their examination . The Position together_with_the votes of the historical Consultors as well as any new explanations by the Relator , should they be necessary -isaia- handed over to the theological Consultors , who_are to cast their vote on the merit of the cause ; their responsibility , together_with_the Promotor of the Faith , -isaia- to study the cause in such_a_way_that , before the Position -isaia- submitted for discussion in their special meeting , controversial theological questions , if there be any , may be examined thoroughly . The definitive votes of the theological Consultors , together_with_the written conclusions of the Promotor of the Faith , are submitted to the judgment of the Cardinals and Bishops . The Congregation examines cases of alleged miracles in the following way : . The Relator assigned to this_task -isaia- to prepare a Position on alleged miracles . They are discussed in a meeting of experts in the case of healings , in a meeting of physicians , whose votes and conclusions are set_forth in an accurate report . Then the miracles are to be discussed in the special meeting of the theologians and , finally , in that of the Cardinals and Bishops . The results of the discussions of the Cardinals and Bishops are reported to the Supreme Pontiff , who alone has the right to declare that public cult may be given by the Church to Servants of God . By a special decree , the Sacred Congregation itself will establish the procedure to be followed henceforth in the individual causes of canonization whose judgment -isaia- presently pending -atti_degli_apostoli- the Sacred Congregation , in accordance , however , with the spirit of this_new law . All that which_we_have established in this Our Constitution -isaia- to take effect from this_very day . Moreover , we wish that_these Our statutes and rules should be , now and hereafter , binding and effective and , insofar as -isaia- necessary , we abrogate the Apostolic Constitutions and Regulations published by Our Predecessors and all other rules , including those_which are worthy of special mention and derogation . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , on the th day of the month of January in the year , the th of Our Pontificate .
