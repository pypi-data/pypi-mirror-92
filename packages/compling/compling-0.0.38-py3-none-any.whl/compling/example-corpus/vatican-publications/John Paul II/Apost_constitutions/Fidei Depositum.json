The Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , which_was opened years_ago by my predecessor Pope John XXIII , of happy_memory , had as its intention and purpose to highlight the Church s apostolic and pastoral mission , and by making the truth of the Gospel shine_forth , to lead all people to seek and receive Christ s love_which surpasses all knowledge cf . The principal task entrusted to the Council by Pope John XXIII was to guard and present better the precious deposit of Christian doctrine in order to make it more accessible to the Christian faithful and to all people_of_good_will . For this_reason_the Council was_not first of all to condemn the errors of the time , but_above all to strive calmly to show the strength and beauty of the doctrine_of_the_faith . '' Illumined by the light of this Council '' , the Pope said , '' the Church . will_become greater in spiritual riches and , gaining the strength of new energies therefrom , she_will look to the future without fear . Our duty -isaia- . to dedicate ourselves with an earnest will and without fear to that work_which our era demands of us , thus pursuing the path which_the Church has followed for centuries . '' With the help of God , the Council Fathers in four years of work were able to produce a considerable collection of doctrinal statements and pastoral norms which_were presented to the whole Church . There the Pastors and Christian faithful find directives for that '' renewal of thought , action , practices and moral virtue , of joy and hope , which_was the very purpose of the Council '' . After its conclusion the Council did not_cease to inspire the Church s life . In I was able to assert : '' For me , then who_had the special grace of participating in it and actively collaborating in its development Vatican II has_always_been , and especially during these years of my Pontificate , the constant reference point of my every pastoral action , in the conscious commitment to implement its directives concretely and faithfully -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of each Church and the whole Church '' . In this_spirit , on January I convoked an Extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for the th anniversary of the close of the Council . The purpose of this assembly was to celebrate the graces and spiritual fruits of Vatican II , to study its teaching in greater depth in order the better to adhere to it and to promote knowledge and application of it . On that occasion the Synod Fathers stated : '' Very many have expressed the desire_that a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding both faith_and_morals be composed , that it might be , as it were , a point of reference for the catechisms or compendiums that_are prepared in various regions . The presentation of doctrine must be biblical and liturgical . It must be sound doctrine suited to the present life of Christians '' . After the Synod ended , I made this desire my own , considering it as '' fully responding to a real need both of the universal Church and of the particular Churches '' . For this_reason we thank the Lord wholeheartedly on this_day when we can_offer the entire Church this reference text entitled the Catechism of the Catholic Church , for a catechesis renewed -atti_degli_apostoli- the living sources of the faith ! Following the renewal of the Liturgy and the new codification of the canon_law of the Latin Church and that of the Oriental Catholic Churches , this catechism will_make a very_important contribution to that work of renewing the whole_life of the Church , as desired and begun by the Second Vatican Council . II THE PROCESS AND SPIRIT OF DRAFTING THE TEXT The Catechism of the Catholic Church -isaia- the result of very extensive collaboration : it was prepared over six years of intense work done in a spirit of complete openness and fervent zeal . In I entrusted a commission of Cardinals and Bishops , chaired by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , with the task of preparing a draft of the catechism requested by the Synod Fathers . An editorial committee of seven diocesan Bishops , experts in theology and catechesis , assisted the commission in its work . The commission , charged with giving directives and with overseeing the course of the work attentively followed all the stages in editing the nine subsequent drafts . The editorial committee , for its part , assumed responsibility_for writing the text , making the emendations requested by the commission and examining the observations of numerous theologians , exegetes and catechists , and above all , of the Bishops of the whole_world , in order to improve the text . The committee was a place of fruitful and enriching exchanges of opinion to ensure the unity and homogeneity of the text . The project was_the object of extensive consultation among all Catholic Bishops , their Episcopal Conferences or Synods , and of theological and catechetical institutes . As a whole , it received a broadly favourable acceptance on the part of the Episcopate . It can_be_said that_this catechism -isaia- the result of the collaboration of the whole Episcopate of the Catholic Church , who generously accepted my invitation to share responsibility_for an enterprise which directly concerns the life of the Church . This response elicits in me a deep feeling of joy , because the harmony of so many voices truly expresses what could be called the symphony of the faith . The achievement of this catechism thus reflects the collegial nature of the Episcopate : it testifies to the Church s catholicity . III ARRANGEMENT OF THE MATERIAL A catechism should faithfully and systematically present_the teaching of Sacred Scripture , the living Tradition of the Church and the authentic Magisterium , as well as the spiritual heritage of the Fathers and the Church s saints , to allow for a better knowledge of the Christian mystery and for enlivening the faith of the People of God . It should_take into_account_the doctrinal statements which down_the_centuries the Holy Spirit has intimated to his Church . It should_also help illumine with the light_of_faith the new situations and problems which_had not_yet emerged in the past . The catechism will thus contain the new and the old cf . Mt : , because the faith_-isaia- always the same yet the source of ever_new light . To respond to this twofold demand , the Catechism of the Catholic Church on the one_hand repeats the old , traditional order already followed by the Catechism of St Pius V , arranging the material in four parts : the Creed , the Sacred Liturgy , with pride of place given to the sacraments , the Christian way_of_life , explained beginning with the Ten Commandments , and finally , Christian prayer . At the same_time , however , the contents are_often expressed in a new_way in order to respond to the questions of our_age . The four parts are related one to the other : the Christian mystery -isaia- the object of faith first part ; it -isaia- celebrated and communicated in liturgical actions second part ; it -isaia- present to enlighten and sustain the children of God in their actions third part ; it -isaia- the basis for our prayer , the privileged expression of which_-isaia- the Our Father , and it represents the object of our supplication , our praise and our intercession fourth part . The Liturgy itself_-isaia- prayer ; the confession of faith finds its_proper place in the celebration of worship . Grace , the fruit of the sacraments , -isaia- the irreplaceable condition_for Christian living , just as participation in the Church s liturgy requires faith . If faith_-isaia- not expressed in works , it -isaia- dead cf . Jas : and cannot bear_fruit unto eternal_life . In reading the Catechism of the Catholic Church we can perceive the wondrous unity of the mystery of God , his saving will , as well as the central place of Jesus Christ , the only_begotten Son of God , sent by the Father , made man in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit , to be our Saviour . Having died and risen , Christ -isaia- always present in his Church , especially in the sacraments ; he -isaia-_the_source of our_faith , the model of Christian conduct and the Teacher of our prayer . IV THE DOCTRINAL VALUE OF THE TEXT The Catechism of the Catholic Church , which I approved June last and the publication of which I today order by virtue of my Apostolic Authority , -isaia- a statement of the Church s faith and of Catholic doctrine , attested to or illumined by Sacred Scripture , Apostolic Tradition and the Church s Magisterium . I declare it to be a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial_communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith . May it serve the renewal to which_the Holy Spirit ceaselessly calls the Church of God , the Body of Christ , on her pilgrimage to the undiminished light of the kingdom ! The approval and publication of the Catechism of the Catholic Church represents a service which_the Successor of Peter wishes to offer to the Holy Catholic Church , and to all the particular Churches in peace_and_communion with the Apostolic See : the service , that_-isaia- , of supporting and confirming the faith of all the Lord Jesus disciples cf . Lk : , as well as of strengthening the bonds of unity in the same apostolic faith . Therefore , I ask the Church s Pastors and the Christian faithful to receive this catechism in a spirit of communion and to use it assiduously in fulfilling their_mission of proclaiming the faith and calling people to the Gospel life . This catechism -isaia- given to them that_it_may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms . It -isaia-_also offered to all the faithful_who wish to deepen their knowledge of the unfathomable riches of salvation cf . It -isaia- meant to support ecumenical efforts that_are moved by the holy desire_for the unity of all Christians , showing carefully the content and wondrous harmony of the Catholic faith . The Catechism of the Catholic Church , lastly , -isaia- offered to every_individual who asks us to give an account of the hope that_-isaia- in us cf . Pt : and who wants to know what_the Catholic Church believes . This catechism -isaia- not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities , the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences , especially if they_have_been approved by the Apostolic See . It -isaia- meant to encourage and assist in the writing of new local catechisms , which_must take into_account various situations and cultures , while carefully preserving the unity of faith and fidelity to Catholic doctrine . V CONCLUSION At the conclusion of this document presenting the Catechism of the Catholic Church , I beseech the Blessed Virgin Mary , Mother of the Incarnate Word and Mother of the Church , to support with_her powerful intercession the catechetical work of the entire Church on every level , -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time when she_-isaia- called to a new effort of evangelization . May the light of the true faith free humanity from ignorance and slavery to sin in order to lead it to the only freedom worthy of the name cf . Jn : : that of life in Jesus Christ under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit , here below and in the kingdom_of_heaven , in the fullness of the blessed vision of God face to face cf . Cor : ; Cor : !
