The third centenary of the Union of your Church with the Church of Rome occurs in the Easter season of this Jubilee of the Year . The Jubilee Year -isaia- a year of grace in which_the whole Church recalls that_our Lord Jesus Christ became man in the womb of the Blessed Virgin , years_ago . In joyfully commemorating this wonderful event , the Christian community feels encouraged again to proclaim_the joyful message of salvation to the world with new energy . Verbum caro factum -ester- : this_-isaia- the reason_for our continual gratitude , this_-isaia- the grace recalled and celebrated in a special_way during the Jubilee period . In this perspective , we can view the whole history of humanity with the eyes of hope . Memory and presence . The years that the Greek Catholic Church of Romania has existed -isaia- an important part of this picture . Exactly one year ago we prayed together in your beloved homeland . During the Divine Liturgy celebrated with you -atti_degli_apostoli- St Joseph s Cathedral in Bucharest , I said_that '' I consider it providential and highly significant that the celebrations of the third centenary will coincide with the Great Jubilee of the Year '' Homily , May , n . The possibility of being with you last May was_the Lord s special gift , which enabled me in a certain way to relive with you the experience of those disciples who_were '' on the way '' : to them '' Jesus himself drew near and went with_them '' , and '' interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself '' Lk : , . Enlightened by Christ s words , together we could contemplate his presence reflected in the face of your Church . Then he nourished us with_his Body and his Blood , and our_hearts burned within us cf . Since then the beauty of your land and the faith of the people living there have remained in my heart . The memory of that meeting became even_more vivid in the Easter season of this_year , when_the third centenary of your Church s Union with the Church of Rome -isaia- being celebrated . My heart longs to be united with you in that joyous hymn Hristos a \u00eenviat ! Christ -isaia- risen ! which during my visit filled me with emotion , leaving a deep echo in my heart . This proclamation goes far beyond words : it -isaia- filled_with_the victorious power of the Risen One , who walks with_his Church through history . It -isaia- in the light of this presence that I address you who_are joyfully celebrating the third centenary of the Union . History and unity . The mystery of unity originates in the mystery of the Incarnation . For the Scriptures say that_it_-isaia- the Father s will to '' unite all things in Christ '' Eph : . To fulfil this_mystery -isaia- the mission of the Church , whose task -isaia- gradually to achieve unity with God and among_men : '' The Church , in Christ , -isaia- in the nature of sacrament a sign and instrument , that_-isaia- , of communion with God and of unity among all men '' Lumen gentium , n . Unity and peace blossom in the Church : in this_way the history of mankind can become a history of unity . The mystery of unity particularly marks the Romanian people . We know , and I recall it here with profound reverence , that the risen Christ , through the apostolic preaching , was already joined to the historical progress of your_people in ancient Christian times and entrusted to them a special commitment to the precious service of unity . The names of the Apostle Andrew , brother of Peter , Nicetas of Remesiana , John Cassian and Dionysius Exiguus are emblematic in this_regard . At a time_when Holy Church had not_yet experienced the great schism within her , divine Providence determined that you_should receive the heritage of Byzantium along_with that of Rome . While remaining a Latin people , Romanians were open , in fact , to receiving the treasures of Byzantine faith and culture . Despite the wound of division , this heritage continues to be shared by the Greek Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church of Romania . This -isaia- the interpretive key to the history of your Church . She extricated herself from the tragic tensions that developed between_the Christian East and West . The hearts of the sons_and_daughters of this ancient Church have_always beaten with a passionate longing for the unity desired by Christ . I myself was deeply moved -atti_degli_apostoli- witnessing this last year . This longing for_unity was felt in a particular_way by the Romanian Church in Transylvania , especially after_the tragedy of the division between Eastern and Western Christianity . In that land , many peoples Romanians , Hungarians , Armenians and Saxons shared a common and sometimes difficult history , which left its marks on the human and religious make up of the inhabitants . Unfortunately , the unity_which characterized the Church in the early centuries was never achieved again , and your history too was marked by division and tears with increasing intensity . Against this background , the efforts of those_who did resign themselves to the wound of schism but sought to heal it shine like bright lights of hope . In Transylvania a desire arose in the hearts of Romanian Christians and their Pastors , especially in the th and th centuries , to re establish complete communion with the Apostolic See of Peter s Successor . These disciples of Christ , spurred by an ardent longing for the reform and the unity of the Church , sensing in the depths of their_hearts an ancient bond with the Church and the city where_the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul were martyred and buried , started a movement that led step by step to full union with Rome . Worthy of mention among the decisive stages are the Synods held in Alba Iulia in and which_were favourable to the Union : the official decision was reached on October and solemnly ratified -atti_degli_apostoli- the Synod of May . Thanks to the work of distinguished Bishops such as Atanasie Anghel , Ioan Inochentie Micu Klein and Petru Pavel Aron and other praiseworthy prelates , priests and lay_people , the Greek Catholic Church of Romania strengthened her identity and in a short time experienced significant development . In view of this , my venerable Predecessor Pius IX , with the Bull Ecclesiam Christi of November , established the Metropolitan See of Fagaras and Alba Iulia for the united Romanians . How could we not acknowledge_the precious services of the Greek Catholic Church to all the Romanian people of Transylvania ? She made a decisive contribution to their growth , symbolically represented by the '' coryphaei '' of the Transylvanian School of Blaj , but_also by many figures clergy and laity who also left an indelible mark on the ecclesial , cultural and social_life of Romanians . A particularly outstanding merit of your Church -isaia- to have mediated between_the East and the West by adopting the values promoted by the Holy See in Transylvania and by communicating to the entire Catholic world_the values of the Christian East , which_were not very accessible due to the existing divisions . The Greek Catholic Church thus became an eloquent witness to the unity of the whole Church , showing how she embodies the values of the institutions , liturgical rites and ecclesiastical traditions which in different_ways derive from the same apostolic tradition cf . Witnesses and martyrs of unity . The way was never easy for the Greek Catholic Church of Romania , as her suffering shows . She was asked to bear a painful and demanding witness of fidelity to the evangelical requirement of unity . Thus she became in a special_way the Church of the witnesses to unity , truth and love . Despite the many difficulties encountered , the Greek Catholic Church of Romania increasingly appeared to the whole Christian world as an extraordinary witness to the indispensable value of ecclesial unity . But it was especially in the second half of the th century , in the age of communist totalitarianism , that_your Church had to suffer a very harsh trial , rightly earning for herself the title : '' Church of confessors and martyrs '' . It was then that the struggle between_the mysterium iniquitatis Thes : and the mysterium pietatis Tm : -atti_degli_apostoli- work in the world became even_more apparent . It -isaia-_also since that_time that the glory of martyrdom has shone with_greater brightness on the face of your Church , like a light reflected in Christian consciences throughout_the_world , prompting admiration and gratitude . Moved by this awareness , I made the most of every opportunity to have news of you , dear brothers_and_sisters , and I would now like to offer you a further expression of my solidarity and support . When I was able to pray with you last year -atti_degli_apostoli- the Catholic cemetery of Bucharest during my pilgrimage to your land , I did so bearing in my heart_the entire Church of Christ and , with the whole Church , I knelt in silence -atti_degli_apostoli- the tombs of your martyrs . We do not_even know many of their burial places , because their persecutors deprived them of even this last mark of distinction and respect . But their names are inscribed in the Book of the Living , and each_one has_received '' a white stone , with a new name written on the stone which no one knows except him_who receives it '' Rv : . The blood of these martyrs -isaia- a leaven of Gospel life which_-isaia-_not only active in your land , but_also in many_other parts_of_the_world . This '' great multitude '' Rv : clothed in white cf . Rv : of your Church s martyrs and confessors , '' who_have come out of the great tribulation , have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb '' Rv : , and who stand '' before the throne of God '' Rv : , -isaia- resplendent with the illustrious names of Bishops such as Vasile Aftenie , Ioan Balan , Valeriu Traian Frentiu , Ioan Suciu , Tit Liviu Chinezu , Alexandru Rusu and Cardinal Iuliu Hossu . Like the men of prayer who '' serve God day and night within his temple '' Rv : , they intercede for their_people with the other martyrs and confessors , receiving from them true and deep veneration . May the witness of martyrdom and the profession_of_faith in Christ and in the unity of his Church rise like the incense of an evening sacrifice cf . Ps : to God s throne in the name of the whole Church , whose esteem and devotion they enjoy ! Revisiting the past : the purification of memory . The splendour of the witness to faith and the generous service to unity must_always be accompanied in the Church by a tireless commitment to truth , in which_the dynamism of hope -isaia- purified and strengthened . This -isaia- the climate of the Jubilee of the Year , in which_the whole Church senses a duty to re examine her past to recognize_the inconsistencies committed by her_children with_regard to the teaching of the Gospel , and thus to be able to walk with a purified face towards_the future desired by God . The current difficulties that_your Church -isaia- encountering in her recovery since her suppression , as well as the limited human and material resources which dampen her enthusiasm , could be demoralizing . But Christians know_that the greater the obstacles to be overcome , the more confidently they_can rely on the help of God , who_-isaia- near and walks -atti_degli_apostoli- their side . This -isaia-_also recalled in your very beautiful hymn '' Cu noi este Dumnezeu '' , so full of meaning and so deeply impressed on your_people s hearts . In this Jubilee your Church , along_with the universal Church , has a duty to revisit her past , especially_the period of persecution , in order to update her_own '' Martyrology '' . It -isaia- not an easy task due to the scarcity of sources and the time that_has passed , a time too brief for making a sufficiently detached judgement , but long enough to expose regrettable omissions . Fortunately , many witnesses of the recent past are_still alive . Therefore the necessary effort should be made to enrich the documentation of past events , so that future generations can know their history , after it has_been critically weighed and -isaia- thus worthy of belief . In this perspective , it will be appropriate for the witness and martyrdom offered by your Church to be examined in the broader context of the suffering and persecution experienced by Christians in the th century . In my Apostolic Letter Tertio millennio adveniente , I specifically referred to the martyrs of our century , '' many of them nameless , '' unknown soldiers as it were of God s great cause '' n . , and I said_that '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the second millennium , the Church has once_again become a Church of martyrs . The witness to Christ borne even to the shedding of blood has become a common inheritance of Catholics , Orthodox , Anglicans and Protestants . This witness must_not be forgotten '' ibid . In the faith and martyrdom of these Christians the unity of the Church appears in a new light . Their blood , shed for Christ and with Christ , -isaia- a sure foundation for seeking the unity of the whole Christian ecumene . In Bucharest I highlighted the fact_that in Romania , too , you suffered together : '' The communist regime suppressed the Church of the Byzantine Romanian rite united with Rome and persecuted Bishops and priests , men_and_women_religious and lay_people , many of whom paid with blood for their fidelity to Christ . I would also like to give due recognition to the members of the Romanian Orthodox Church and of other Churches and religious communities who suffered similar persecutions and grave restrictions . Death united our_brothers_and_sisters in faith in the heroic witness of martyrdom : they_have left us an unforgettable lesson of love for Christ and his Church '' Arrival address , Baneasa Airport , Bucharest , May , n . In this_regard , I also encourage you now , during the celebration of the Jubilee and the third centenary of your Union , to identify and appreciate the martyrs of the Greek Catholic Church of Romania , recognizing their merit in having given a considerable impetus to the cause of Christian unity . It will_also be very useful to consider today s situation in the light of your history . For it seems necessary to make a thorough examination of the context , spirit and decisions of your Provincial Synods held in , and . The same revisiting of history should_also concern other important events which_have marked the history of the Greek Catholic Church of Romania . The example of the distinguished scholars of the Transylvanian School of Blaj , who have_made a close examination of events , guided by serious historical and linguistic analysis , can serve as an important reference point for_this research in order to obtain reliable results . With this_kind of re examination , fundamental aspects for the theological , liturgical and spiritual tradition of the Greek Catholic Church in Romania will certainly come to light . In this_way , your Church s identity and her spiritual profile will appear with new vigour and thus contribute to the culture of Romania and of the whole Christian world . I wholeheartedly encourage and bless every_effort made in this_regard . There should_also be a special effort to address the problem of the reception of the Second Vatican Council on the part of the Greek Catholic Church of Romania . Because of the persecutions -atti_degli_apostoli- the time , your Church did_not have_the opportunity to participate fully in that historical event nor was_the action of the Spirit clearly perceived . It was precisely that Council which devoted greater attention to the sensitive questions of the Eastern Catholic Churches , ecumenism and the Church in general . The Council s teaching was then continued by the subsequent Magisterium . I -amos- pleased to see_that the Greek Catholic Church of Romania -isaia- currently involved in a long , laborious effort to accept fully all the Holy See s directives . Thanks to the presence of the Holy Spirit pluralism in the Church can shine with ineffable beauty without jeopardizing her unity . In this_regard , the Second Vatican Council spoke of the treasures of the Eastern Churches in communion with Rome : '' For in those Churches , which_are distinguished by their venerable antiquity , there_-isaia- clearly evident the tradition which_has come from the Apostles through the Fathers and which_-isaia- part of the divinely revealed , undivided heritage of the universal Church '' Orientalium Ecclesiarum , n . Thus the entire Christian ecumene needs their voice and presence : '' The holy Catholic Church , which_-isaia- the Mystical Body of Christ , -isaia- made up of the faithful_who are organically united in the Holy Spirit by the same faith , the same sacraments and the same government . They combine into different groups , which_are held together by their hierarchy , and so form particular Churches or rites . Between those Churches there_-isaia- such a wonderful communion that_this variety , so far from diminishing the Church s unity , rather serves to emphasize it '' ibid . The Catholic Church , supported by the teachings of the Second Vatican Council , has committed herself with all determination , especially in recent decades , to the quest for_unity among Christ s disciples . My immediate Predecessors , starting with John XXIII of venerable memory , increased their_efforts for ecumenical reconciliation , especially with the Orthodox Churches , seeing this as a precise requirement of the Gospel and a response to the insistent promptings of the Holy Spirit . Under the merciful gaze of her Lord , the Church remembers her past , acknowledges the errors of her_children , confesses their lack of love for their brethren in Christ and consequently asks forgiveness and forgives , seeking to re establish full unity among Christians . The attempt to seek full communion_-isaia- inevitably conditioned by the historical context , the political situation and the dominant mentality of any era . In this_regard , the Transylvanian Union conformed to the model of unity_which prevailed after_the Councils of Florence and Trent . At that_time , it was_the ardent longing for unity_which brought the Romanians of Transylvania to union with the Church of Rome , and we are all deeply grateful to God for this_gift . However , since communion among the Churches can_never be considered a goal definitively reached , the gift of unity offered by the Lord Jesus once and for all must be answered with a constant attitude of acceptance , the fruit of each_one s inner conversion . The changed circumstances of the present_time require , in fact , that_unity be pursued within a broader ecumenical horizon , in which we must be willing to listen to the Spirit and courageously rethink our relationships with the other Churches and with all our_brothers_and_sisters in Christ , with the attitude of those_who can '' hope against all hope '' cf . Precisely with_regard to the gift of unity , in my Apostolic Letter Tertio millennio adveniente I noted : '' We are asked to respond to this_gift responsibly , without compromise in our witness to the truth '' n . It will therefore be necessary to reconsider the three centuries old history of the Greek Catholic Church of Romania with a new outlook , with a calm and serene approach to the events which_have marked her way . Just as I encouraged the process of reviewing the ways in which_the Petrine service -isaia- exercised within_the Christian ecumene , while preserving the requirements that stem from the will of Christ cf . Encyclical Ut unum sint , n . , so I urge you to start examining and bringing up to date the specific vocation of the Eastern Churches in communion with Rome in the new context , calling on all the Churches for the contribution of their study and reflection . The Theological Commissions established by the Pastors of the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches as a whole should endeavour to work in this complex perspective . Christians are currently faced_with the problem of '' receiving the results already achieved . These cannot remain the statements of bilateral commissions but must become a common heritage . For this to come about and for the bonds of communion to be strengthened , a serious examination needs to be made , which , by different_ways and means and -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels of responsibility , must involve the whole People of God '' ibid . For '' this_process . to be successful , its results must be made_known in appropriate ways '' ibid . The quest for Christian unity , in love and truth , -isaia- a fundamental element for a more_effective evangelization . In fact , the Church -isaia- one and indivisible by Christ s will . An authentic return to the liturgical and patristic traditions , a treasure which_you share_with the Orthodox Church , will contribute to reconciliation with the other Churches present in Romania . In this_spirit of reconciliation the continuation of the dialogue_between your Church and the Orthodox Church should be warmly encouraged -atti_degli_apostoli- both the national and local levels , in the hope_that all the disputed points will soon be clarified in a spirit of justice and Christian charity . At the same_time , the spirit of dialogue requires that_your Church should increasingly and gratefully discover the face of Christ Jesus traced by the Holy Spirit in her Sister Orthodox Church , and you_should expect the same from her in your regard . Thus you will bear the witness that the Apostle Paul asks from the Christians of Rome cf . For the Jubilee the Church seeks to renew herself in the joyful light of the risen Christ , inviting her_children to respond to God s grace with a serious examination of conscience and the effort of purification and penance . It -isaia- a long process which began -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the Second Vatican Council and has not_yet ended . We have rediscovered what has_always_been the holy root nourishing the Church : the Word of God , interpreted factis et verbis by the liturgy , the Councils , the Fathers and the saints . But we have_also forcefully repeated that the principal source of unity in the Church -isaia- the Holy Trinity cf . The Greek Catholic Church of Romania -isaia-_also rooted in the Word of God , in the teaching of the Fathers and in the Byzantine tradition , but in addition finds her_own particular expression in her union with the Apostolic See , in the mark of the th century persecutions and in the Latin character of her people . All these elements form the identity of your Church , whose ultimate root -isaia- the Holy Trinity . These are her primary origin , the source '' of living water '' Jn : , to which_she should_have constant recourse . It -isaia- my firm conviction_that the return to the well springs of the Church s traditions must be accompanied by a constant and fervent return to the Trinitarian Source . This will only be possible if each of us recovers that deep intimacy which_-isaia- expressed in prayer . Prayer gives man strength and illumines his way . In the deep silence of the prayer experience , we can recognize_the true image of the Church in her authentic and eternal identity , and can_also discover that name known only to God which represents the truest identity of every Christian . For this_reason_the Jubilee of the Year and the third centenary of your Church s Union with Rome are a time of prayer to which God himself_-isaia- inviting us . May the All Holy Mother of God enlighten and accompany us , she_who remains forever the perfect image of the Church and our advocate before God s throne . With this wish , I cordially impart the Apostolic Blessing to my Venerable Brother Cardinal Alexandru Todea , Metropolitan Archbishop emeritus of Fagaras and Alba Iulia , to the current Archbishop Metropolitan , Lucian Muresan , to my other Brothers in the Episcopate , and to the priests , the religious and all of you , dear faithful of the Greek Catholic Church of Romania . From the Vatican , May , the twenty second year of my Pontificate .
