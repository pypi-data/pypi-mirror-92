Twenty five years_ago on December the Supreme Pontiff Paul VI promulgated the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium on the Sacred Liturgy , which_the Fathers of the Second Vatican Council , gathered in the Holy Spirit , had approved but a short time before . It was a memorable event on several accounts . Indeed , it was_the first fruit of the Council , called by Pope John XXIII , to update the Church . The moment had_been prepared_for by a great liturgical and pastoral movement and was a source of hope_for the life and the renewal of the Church . In putting into_practice the reform of the Liturgy , the Council achieved in a special_way the fundamental aim which it had set itself : '' To impart an ever_increasing vigour to the Christian life of the faithful ; to adapt more suitably to the needs of our_own times those institutions that_are subject to change ; to foster whatever can promote union among all who_believe in Christ ; to strengthen whatever can_help to call the whole of humanity into the household of the Church '' . From the beginning of my pastoral_ministry in the See of Peter , I have_taken care to '' state the lasting importance of the Second Vatican Council '' calling attention to '' our clear duty to devote our energies to putting it into_effect '' . Our efforts have_been directed towards '' bringing to maturity in the sense of movement and of life the fruitful seeds which_the Fathers of the Ecumenical Council , nourished by the word of God , cast upon the good soil cf Mt : , , that_-isaia- , their authoritative teaching and pastoral decisions '' . On several occasions I have developed various aspects of the conciliar teaching on the Liturgy and have emphasized the importance of the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium for the life of the people of God : in it '' the substance of that ecclesiological doctrine which_would later be put before the conciliar Assembly -isaia-_already evident . The Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium , the first conciliar document , anticipated '' the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen Gentium on the Church and amplified , in its turn , the teaching of the Constitution . After a quarter of a century , during which both the Church and society have experienced profound and rapid changes , it -isaia- a fitting moment to throw light on the importance of the Conciliar Constitution , its relevance in relation to new problems and the enduring value of its principles . IRENEWAL IN ACCORD WITH TRADITION . In response to the requests of the Fathers of the Council of Trent , concerned_with the reform of the Church in their time , Pope Saint Pius V saw to the reform of the liturgical books , above all the Breviary and the Missal . It was towards this_same goal that succeeding Roman Pontiffs directed their energies during the subsequent centuries in order to ensure_that the rites and liturgical books were brought up to date and when necessary clarified . From the beginning of this century they undertook a more general reform . Pope Saint Pius X established a special Commission for_this reform and he thought that it would take a number of years for it to complete its work ; however he laid the foundation stone of this edifice by renewing the Roman Breviary . '' In fact this all demands '' he affirmed , '' according to the views of the experts , a work both detailed and extensive ; and therefore it -isaia- necessary_that many years should pass , before this liturgical edifice , so to speak , . reappears in new splendour in its dignity and harmony , once the marks of old age have_been cleared away '' . Pope Pius XII took up again the great project of liturgical reform by issuing the Encyclical Mediator Dei and by establishing a new Commission . He likewise decided important matters for example : authorizing a new version of the Psalter to facilitate the understanding of the Psalms ; the modification of the Eucharistic fast in order to facilitate access to Holy Communio ; the use of contemporary language in the Ritual ; and , above all , the reform of the Easter Vigil and Holy Week . The introduction to the Roman Missal of was preceded by the declaration of Pope John XXIII , according to which '' the fundamental principles , related to the general reform of the Liturgy , were to be entrusted to the Fathers in the forthcoming Ecumenical Council '' . Such an overall reform of the Liturgy was in harmony_with_the general hope of the whole Church . In fact , the liturgical spirit had become more_and_more widespread together_with_the desire_for an '' active participation in the most_holy mysteries and in the public and solemn prayer of the Church '' , and a wish to hear_the word of God in more abundant measure . Together with the biblical renewal , the ecumenical movement , the missionary impetus and ecclesiological research , the reform of the Liturgy was to contribute to the overall renewal of the Church . I draw attention to this in the Letter Dominicae Cenae : '' A very close and organic bond exists between_the renewal of the Liturgy and the renewal of the whole_life of the Church . The Church not_only acts but_also expresses herself in the Liturgy and draws from the Liturgy the strength for her_life '' . The reform of the rites and the liturgical books was undertaken immediately after_the promulgation of the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium and was brought to an effective conclusion in a few years thanks to the considerable and selfless work of a large number of experts and bishops from all parts_of_the_world . This work was undertaken in accordance_with_the conciliar principles of fidelity to tradition and openness to legitimate development ; and so it -isaia- possible to say that the reform of the Liturgy -isaia- strictly traditional and in accordance_with '' the ancient usage of the holy Fathers '' . IITHE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSTITUTION . The guiding principles of the Constitution which_were the basis of the reform , remain fundamental in the task of leading the faithful to an active celebration of the mysteries , '' the primary and indispensable source of the true Christian spirit '' . Now that the greater part of the liturgical books have_been published , translated and brought into use , it -isaia- still necessary to keep these_principles constantly in mind and to build upon them . a The re enactment of the Paschal Mystery . The first principle -isaia- the reenactment of the Paschal Mystery of Christ in the Liturgy of the Church , based on the fact_that '' it was from the side of Christ as he slept on the Cross that_there issued forth the sublime sacrament of the whole Church '' . The whole of liturgical life gravitates about the Eucharistic Sacrifice and the other sacraments in which we draw upon the living springs of salvation cf . Hence we must_have a sufficient awareness_that through the '' Paschal Mystery we have_been buried with Christ in Baptism , so that_we_may rise with_him to new_life '' . When the faithful participate in the Eucharist they_must understand_that truly '' each time we offer this memorial sacrifice the work of our redemption -isaia- accomplished '' , and to this_end bishops must carefully train the faithful to celebrate every Sunday the marvelous work that Christ has wrought in the mystery of his Passover , in order_that they likewise may proclaim it to the world . In the hearts of all , bishops and faithful , Easter must regain its unique importance in the liturgical year , so that it really -isaia- the Feast of feasts . Since Christ s Death on the Cross and his Resurrection constitute the content of the daily_life of the Church and the pledge of his eternal Passover , the Liturgy has as its first task to lead us untiringly back to the Easter pilgrimage initiated by Christ , in which we accept death in order to enter_into life . In order to reenact his Paschal Mystery , Christ -isaia- ever present in his Church , especially in liturgical celebrations . Hence the Liturgy -isaia- the privileged place_for the encounter of Christians with God and the one whom he has_sent , Jesus Christ cf Jn : . Christ -isaia- present in the Church assembled -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer in his_name . It -isaia- this_fact which_gives such a unique character to the Christian assembly with the consequent duties not_only of brotherly welcome but_also of forgiveness cf Mt : , and of dignity of behaviour , gesture and song . Christ -isaia- present and acts in the person of the ordained minister who celebrates . The priest_-isaia- not merely entrusted with a function , but in virtue of the Ordination received he has_been consecrated to act '' in persona Christi '' . To this consecration there_must be a corresponding disposition , both inward and outward , also reflected in liturgical vestments , in the place which he occupies and in the word which he utters . Christ -isaia- present in his_word as proclaimed in the assembly and which , commented upon in the homily , -isaia- to be listened to in faith and assimilated in prayer . All this_must derive from the dignity of the book and of the place appointed for the proclamation of the word of God , and from the attitude of the reader , based upon an awareness of the fact_that the reader -isaia- the spokesman of God before his or her brothers_and_sisters . Christ -isaia- present and acts by the power of the Holy Spirit in the sacraments and , in a special and preeminent fashion sublimiori modo , in the Sacrifice of the Mass under the Eucharistic Species , also when these_are reserved in the tabernacle apart_from the celebration with_a_view to Communion of the sick and adoration by the faithful . With regard to this real and mysterious presence , it -isaia-_the_duty of pastors to recall frequently in their catechetical instruction the teaching of the faith , a teaching that_the_faithful must live out and that theologians are called_upon to expound . Faith in this presence of the Lord involves an outward sign of respect towards_the church , the holy place in which God manifests himself in mystery cf Ex . : , especially during the celebration of the sacraments : holy things must_always be treated in a holy manner . a the reading of the Word of God . The second principle -isaia- the presence of the word of God . The Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium sets out likewise to restore a '' more abundant reading from Holy Scripture , one more varied and more appropriate '' . The basic reasons for_this restoration -isaia- expressed both in the Constitution on the Liturgy , namely , so that '' the intimate link between rite and word '' may be manifested , and also in the Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation , which teaches : '' The Church has_always venerated the divine Scriptures , just as she_has venerated the very body of the Lord , never ceasing above all in the Sacred Liturgy to nourish herself on the bread of life and the table both of the word of God , and of the Body of Christ , and to minister it to the faithful '' . Growth in liturgical life and consequently progress in Christian life cannot be achieved except by continually promoting among the faithful , and above all among priests , a '' warm and living knowledge of Scripture '' . The word of God -isaia-_now better known in the Christian communities , but a true renewal sets further and ever_new requirements : fidelity to the authentic meaning of the Scriptures which must_never be lost from view , especially_when the Scriptures are translated into different languages ; the manner of proclaiming the word of God so that_it_may be perceived for_what it -isaia- ; the use of appropriate technical means ; the interior disposition of the ministers of the Word so that_they carry_out properly their function in the liturgical assembly ; careful preparation of the homily through study and meditation ; effort on the part of the faithful to participate -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of the word ; a taste for prayer with the Psalms ; a desire to discover Christ \u2013 like the disciples -atti_degli_apostoli- Emmaus \u2013 -atti_degli_apostoli- the table of the word and the bread . b The self manifestation of the Church . Finally the Council saw in the Liturgy an epiphany of the Church : it -isaia- the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer . In celebrating Divine Worship the Church gives expression to what she_-isaia- One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic . The Church manifests herself as one , with_that unity_which comes to her from the Trinity , especially_when the holy people of God participates '' in the one Eucharist , in one_and_the_same prayer , -atti_degli_apostoli- the one altar , presided over by the bishop surrounded by his presbyterate and his ministers '' . Let nothing in the celebration of the Liturgy disrupt or obscure this_unity of the Church ! The Church expresses the holiness that comes to her from Christ cf . Eph : when , gathered in one_body by the Holy Spirit who makes holy and gives_life , she communicates to the faithful by means of the Eucharist and the other sacraments all the graces and blessings of the Father . In liturgical celebration the Church expresses her catholicity , since in her the Spirit of the Lord gathers together people of all languages in the profession of the same faith and from East to West presents to God the Father the offering of Christ , and offers herself together_with him . In the Liturgy the Church manifests herself as apostolic , because the faith_that she professes -isaia- founded upon the witness of the apostles ; because in the celebration of the mysteries , presided over by the bishop , successor of the apostle , or by a minister ordained in the apostolic succession , she faithfully hands on what she_has received_from_the Apostolic Tradition ; and because the worship which_she renders to God commits her to the mission of spreading the Gospel in the world . Thus it -isaia-_especially in the Liturgy that the Mystery of the Church -isaia- proclaimed , experienced and lived . IIIGuidelines for the renewal of liturgical life . From these_principles are derived certain norms and guidelines which_must govern_the renewal of liturgical life . While the reform of the Liturgy desired by the Second Vatican Council , can be considered already in progress , the pastoral promotion of the Liturgy constitutes a permanent commitment to draw ever_more abundantly from the riches of the Liturgy that vital force which spreads from Christ to the members of his Body which_-isaia- the Church . Since the Liturgy -isaia- the exercise of the priesthood of Christ , it -isaia- necessary to keep ever alive the affirmation of the disciple faced_with the mysterious presence of the Lord : '' It -isaia- the Lord ! '' Jn : . Nothing of what we do in the Liturgy can appear more_important than what in an unseen but real manner Christ accomplishes by the power of his Spirit . A faith alive in charity , adoration , praise of the Father and silent contemplation will_always be the prime objective of liturgical and pastoral_care . Since the Liturgy -isaia- totally permeated by the word of God , any_other word must be in harmony_with it , above all in the homily , but_also in the various interventions of the minister and in the hymns which_are sung . No other reading may supplant the Biblical word , and the words of men must be -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the word of God without obscuring it . Since liturgical celebrations are_not private acts but '' celebrations of the Church , the sacrament of unity '' , their regulation -isaia- dependent solely upon the hierarchical authority of the Church . The Liturgy belongs to the whole_body of the Church . It -isaia- for this_reason that_it_-isaia- not permitted to anyone , even the priest , or any group , to subtract or change anything whatsoever on their_own initiative . Fidelity to the rites and to the authentic texts of the Liturgy -isaia- a requirement of the Lex orandi , which must_always be in conformity_with_the Lex credendi . A lack of fidelity on this_point may even affect the very validity of the sacraments . Since it -isaia- a celebration of the Church , the Liturgy requires the active , conscious and full participation of all , according to the diversity of Orders and of office . All the ministers and the other faithful , in the accomplishment of their particular function , do that and only that_which_-isaia- proper to them . It -isaia- for_this reason_that the Church gives preference to celebrations in common , when_the nature of the rites implies this ; she encourages the formation of ministers , readers , cantors and commentators , who carry_out a true liturgical ministry ; she_has restored concelebration , and she recommends the common celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours . Given that the Liturgy -isaia- the school of the prayer of the Church , it has_been considered good to introduce and develop the use of the vernacular \u2013 without diminishing the use of Latin , retained by the Council for the Latin Rite \u2013 so that every_individual can understand and proclaim in his or her mother tongue the wonders of God cf Acts : . It has likewise been considered good to increase the number of Prefaces and Eucharistic Prayers , so as to enrich the Church s treasury of prayer and an understanding of the mystery of Christ . Since the Liturgy has great pastoral value , the liturgical books have provided for a certain degree of adaptation to the assembly and to individuals , with the possibility of openness to the traditions and cultures of different peoples . The revision of the rites has sought a noble simplicity and signs that_are easily understood , but the desired simplicity must_not degenerate into an impoverishment of the signs . On the contrary , the signs , above all the sacramental signs , must be easily grasped but carry the greatest possible expressiveness . Bread and wine , water and oil , and also incense , ashes , fire and flowers , and indeed almost all the elements of creation have_their place in the Liturgy as gifts to the Creator and as a contribution to the dignity and beauty of the celebration . IVThe practical application of the reform a Difficulties . It must be recognized that the application of the liturgical reform has met with difficulties due especially to an unfavourable environment marked by a tendency to see religious practice as something of a private affair , by a certain rejection of institutions , by a decrease in visibility of the Church in society , and by a calling into question of personal faith . It can_also be supposed that the transition from simply being present , very often in a rather passive and silent way , to a fuller and more active participation has_been for some people too demanding . Different and even contradictory reactions to the reform have resulted from this . Some have_received the new books with a certain indifference , or without trying to understand_the reasons for the changes ; others , unfortunately , have turned back in a one sided and exclusive way to the previous liturgical forms which some of them consider to be the sole guarantee of certainty in faith . Others have promoted outlandish innovations , departing from the norms issued by the authority of the Apostolic See or the bishops , thus disrupting the unity of the Church and the piety of the faithful and even on occasion contradicting matters of faith . This should_not lead anyone to forget_that the vast majority of the pastors and the Christian people_have accepted the liturgical reform in a spirit of obedience and indeed joyful fervour . For this we should give thanks to God for that movement of the Holy Spirit in the Church which_the liturgical renewal represents ; for the fact_that the table of the word of God -isaia-_now abundantly furnished for all ; for the immense effort undertaken throughout_the_world to provide the Christian people_with translations of the Bible , the Missal and other liturgical books ; for the increased participation of the faithful by prayer and song , gesture and silence , in the Eucharist and the other sacraments ; for the ministries exercised by lay_people and the responsibilities that_they_have assumed in virtue of the common priesthood into which_they_have been initiated through Baptism and Confirmation ; for the radiant vitality of so many Christian communities , a vitality drawn_from the wellspring of the Liturgy . These are all reasons for holding fast to the teaching of the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium and to the reforms which it has made possible : '' the liturgical renewal -isaia-_the_most visible fruit of the whole work of the Council '' . For many_people the message of the Second Vatican Council has_been experienced principally through the liturgical reform . Side by side with_these benefits of the liturgical reform , one_has to acknowledge with regret deviations of greater or lesser seriousness in its application . On occasion there have_been noted illicit omissions or additions , rites invented outside the framework of established norms ; postures or songs which_are not conducive to faith or to a sense of the sacred ; abuses in the practice of general absolution ; confusion between_the ministerial priesthood , linked_with Ordination , and the common priesthood of the faithful , which_has its foundation in Baptism . It cannot be tolerated that certain priests should_take upon themselves the right to compose Eucharistic Prayers or to substitute profane readings for texts from Sacred Scripture . Initiatives of this_sort , far_from_being linked_with the liturgical reform as such , or with the books which_have issued from it , are in direct contradiction to it , disfigure it and deprive the Christian people of the genuine treasures of the Liturgy of the Church . It -isaia- for the bishops to root out such abuses , because the regulation of the Liturgy depends on the bishop within_the limits of the law and because '' the life in Christ of his faithful people in some sense -isaia- derived_from and depends on him '' . VThe future of the renewal . The Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium -isaia- the expression of the unanimous voice of the College of Bishops gathered around_the Successor of Peter and with the help of the Spirit of Truth promised by the Lord Jesus cf . The Constitution continues to sustain the Church along the paths of renewal and of holiness by fostering genuine liturgical life . The principles enunciated in that document are an orientation also_for the future of the Liturgy , in such_a_way_that the liturgical reform may be ever better understood and implemented . '' It -isaia- therefore necessary and urgent to actuate a new and intensive education in order to discover all the riches contained in the Liturgy '' . The Liturgy of the Church goes beyond_the liturgical reform . We are_not in the same situation as obtained in : a generation of priests and of faithful which_has not known the liturgical books prior to the reform now acts with responsibility in the Church and society . One cannot therefore continue to speak of a change as it was spoken of -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the Constitution s publication ; rather one_has to speak of an ever deeper grasp of the Liturgy of the Church , celebrated according to the current books and lived above all as a reality in the spiritual order . a Biblical and liturgical formation . The most urgent task -isaia- that of the biblical and liturgical formation of the people of God , both pastors and faithful . The Constitution had_already stressed this : '' There -isaia- no hope_that this may come to pass unless pastors of souls themselves become imbued more_deeply with the spirit and power of the liturgy so as to become masters of it '' . This -isaia- a long term programme , which_must begin in the seminaries and houses of formation and continue throughout their priestly life . A formation suited to their state -isaia- indispensable also_for lay_people , especially since in many regions they_are_called upon to assume ever more_important responsibilities in the community . Another important task for the future -isaia- that of the adaptation of the Liturgy to different_cultures . The Constitution set_forth the principle , indicating the procedure to be followed by the bishops conferences . The adaptation of languages has_been rapidly accomplished , even if on occasion with some difficulties . It has_been followed by the adaptation of rites , which_-isaia- a more delicate matter but equally necessary . There remains the considerable task of continuing to implant the Liturgy in certain cultures , welcoming from them those expressions which_are compatible with aspects of the true and authentic spirit of the Liturgy , in respect_for the substantial unity of the Roman Rite as expressed in the liturgical books . The adaptation must_take account of the fact_that in the Liturgy , and notably that of the sacraments , there_-isaia- a part which_-isaia- unchangeable , because_it_-isaia- of divine institution , and of which_the Church -isaia- the guardian . There are_also parts open to change , which_the Church has the power and on occasion also the duty to adapt to the cultures of recently evangelized peoples . This -isaia- not a new problem for the Church . Liturgical diversity can be a source of enrichment , but it can_also provoke tensions , mutual misunderstandings and even divisions . In this_field it -isaia- clear_that diversity must_not damage unity . It can_only gain expression in fidelity to the common Faith , to the sacramental signs that the Church has received_from Christ and to hierarchical communion . Cultural adaptation also requires conversion of heart and even , where necessary , a breaking with ancestral customs incompatible with the Catholic faith . This demands a serious formation in theology , history and culture , as well as sound judgement in discerning what_-isaia- necessary or useful and what_-isaia- not useful or even dangerous to faith . '' A satisfactory development in this area cannot_but be the fruit of a progressive maturing in faith , one_which encompasses spiritual discernment , theological lucidity , and a sense of the universal Church , acting in broad harmony '' . c Attention to new problems . The effort towards liturgical renewal must furthermore respond to the needs of our_time . The Liturgy -isaia- not disincarnate . In these twenty five years new problems have arisen or have assumed new importance , for example : the exercise of a diaconate open to married men ; liturgical tasks in celebrations which_can be entrusted to lay_people ; liturgical celebrations for children , for young_people and the disabled ; the procedures for the composition of liturgical texts appropriate to a particular country . In the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium there_-isaia- no reference to these problems , but the general principles are given which serve to coordinate and promote liturgical life . d Liturgy and popular devotions . Finally , to safeguard the form and ensure the promotion of the Liturgy it -isaia- necessary to take account of popular Christian devotion and its relation to liturgical life . This popular devotion should_not be ignored or treated with indifference or contempt , since_it_-isaia- rich in values , and per se gives expression to the religious attitude towards God . But it needs to be continually evangelized , so that the faith_which it expresses may_become an ever_more mature and authentic act . Both the pious exercises of the Christian people and also other_forms of devotion are welcomed and encouraged provided_that they_do_not replace or intrude into liturgical celebrations . An authentic pastoral promotion of the Liturgy will build upon the riches of popular_piety , purifying and directing them towards_the Liturgy as the offering of the peoples . VIThe organisms responsible_for liturgical renewal a The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments . The task of promoting the renewal of the Liturgy pertains in the first_place to the Apostolic See . It was four hundred years_ago that Pope Sixtus V created the Sacred Congregation of Rites and entrusted it with responsibility_for keeping watch over the exercise of Divine Worship , reformed after_the Council of Trent . Pope Saint Pius X instituted another Congregation for the Discipline of the Sacraments . With a view to the practical implementation of the Second Vatican Council s Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium on the Liturgy , Pope Paul VI instituted a Consilium later the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship and they carried_out the task entrusted to them_with generosity , competence and promptness . In accordance_with_the new structure of the Roman Curia as laid_down by the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus , the whole area of Sacred Liturgy -isaia- brought together and placed under the responsibility of a single Dicastery : the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments . Always taking into_account_the area of competence of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith it pertains to this Congregation to regulate and promote the Liturgy of which_the Sacraments are the essential part , by encouraging pastoral liturgical activities , supporting the various Organisms devoted to the liturgical apostolate , music , song and sacred art , and keeping watch over sacramental discipline . This -isaia- a work of importance for it concerns above all the faithful preservation of the great principles of the Catholic Liturgy , as illustrated and developed in the Conciliar Constitution . It -isaia- likewise a question of drawing upon these_principles for inspiration and promoting and deepening throughout_the Church the renewal of liturgical life . The Congregation will assist diocesan bishops in their_efforts to offer to God true Christian worship and to regulate it according to the precepts of the Lord and the laws of the Church . It will be in close and trusting contact_with_the bishops conferences for all that pertains to their competence in the liturgical field . b The Bishops Conferences . The Bishops Conferences have_had the weighty responsibility of preparing the translations of the liturgical books . Immediate need occasionally led to the use of provisional translations , approved ad interim . But now the time has come to reflect upon a certain difficulties that_have subsequently emerged , to remedy certain defects or inaccuracies , to complete partial translations , to compose or approve chants to be used in the Liturgy , to ensure respect_for the texts approved and lastly to publish liturgical books in a form that both testifies to the stability achieved and -isaia- worthy of the mysteries being celebrated . For the work of translation , as well as for the wider implications of liturgical renewal for whole countries , each bishops conference was required to establish a national commission and ensure the collaboration of experts in the various sectors of liturgical science and pastoral practice . The time has come to evaluate this commission , its past activity , both the positive and negative aspects , and the guidelines and the help which_-isaia- has received_from_the bishops conference regarding its composition and activity . The role of this commission -isaia- much_more delicate when_the conference wishes to introduce measures of adaptation or inculturation : this_-isaia- one reason_for making sure_that the commission contains people_who_are truly competent . d The diocesan bishop . In every diocese the bishop_-isaia- the principal dispenser of the mysteries of God , and likewise the governor , promoter and guardian of the entire liturgical life of the Church entrusted to him . When the bishop celebrates in the midst of his_people , it -isaia- the very mystery of the Church which_-isaia- manifested . Therefore it -isaia- necessary_that the bishop should be strongly convinced of the importance of such celebrations for the Christian life of his faithful . Such celebrations should be models for the whole diocese . Much still remains to be done to help priests and the faithful to grasp the meaning of the liturgical texts , to develop the dignity and beauty of celebrations and the places_where they_are held , and to promote , as the Fathers did , a '' mystagogic catechesis '' of the sacraments . In order to bring this_task to a successful conclusion , the bishop should set up one or more diocesan commissions which help him to promote liturgical activity , music and sacred art in his diocese . The diocesan commission , for its part , will act according to the mind and directives of the bishop and should be able to count upon his authority and his encouragement to carry_out its particular task properly . The Liturgy does_not exhaust the entire activity of the Church , as the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium pointed_out . It -isaia- , however , a source and summit . It -isaia- a source , because above all from the sacraments the faithful draw abundantly the water of grace_which flows from the side of the Crucified Christ . To use an image dear to Pope John XXIII , it -isaia- like the village fountain to which_every generation comes to draw water ever living and fresh . It -isaia-_also a summit , both because all the activity of the Church -isaia-_directed towards_the communion of life with Christ , and because_it_-isaia- in the Liturgy that the Church manifests and communicates to the faithful the work of salvation , accomplished once and for all by Christ . The time has come to renew that spirit_which inspired the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the moment when_the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium was prepared , discussed , voted upon and promulgated , and when_the first steps were taken to apply it . The seed was sown ; it has know_the rigours of winter , but the seed has sprouted , and become a tree . It -isaia-_a_matter of the organic growth of a tree becoming ever stronger the deeper it sinks its roots into the soil of tradition . I wish to recall what I said -atti_degli_apostoli- the Congress of Liturgical Commissions in : in the work of liturgical renewal , desired by the Council , it -isaia- necessary to keep in mind '' with_great balance the part of God and the part of man , the hierarchy and the faithful , tradition and progress , the law and adaptation , the individual and the community , silence and choral praise . Thus the Liturgy on earth will fuse with_that of heaven where . it will form one choir . to praise with one voice the Father through Jesus Christ '' With this confident hope , which in my heart becomes a prayer , I impart to all my Apostolic Blessing .
