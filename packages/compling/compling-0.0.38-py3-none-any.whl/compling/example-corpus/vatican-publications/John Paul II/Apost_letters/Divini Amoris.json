THE SCIENCE OF DIVINE LOVE , which_the Father of mercies pours out through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit , -isaia-_a_gift granted to the little and the humble so that_they_may know and proclaim_the secrets of the kingdom , hidden from the learned and the wise ; for this_reason Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit , praising the Father who graciously willed it so cf . Mother Church also rejoices in noting that throughout history the Lord has continued to reveal himself to the little and the humble , enabling his chosen ones , through the Spirit who '' searches everything , even the depths of God '' Cor : , to speak of the gifts '' bestowed on us by God . in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit , interpreting spiritual truths in spiritual language '' Cor : , . In this_way the Holy Spirit guides the Church into the whole truth , endowing her with various gifts , adorning her with_his fruits , rejuvenating her with the power of the Gospel and enabling her to discern the signs of the times in order to respond ever more_fully to the will of God cf . Shining brightly among the little ones to whom_the secrets of the kingdom were revealed in a most special_way -isaia- Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face , a professed nun of the Order of Discalced Carmelites , the th anniversary of whose entry into the heavenly homeland occurs this_year . During her_life Th\u00e9r\u00e8se discovered '' new lights , hidden and mysterious meanings '' Ms A , v and received_from_the divine Teacher that '' science of love '' which_she then expressed with particular originality in her writings cf . This science -isaia- the luminous expression of her knowledge of the mystery of the kingdom and of her personal experience of grace . It can be considered a special charism of Gospel wisdom which Th\u00e9r\u00e8se , like other saints and teachers of faith , attained in prayer cf . The reception given to the example of her_life and Gospel teaching in our century was quick , universal and constant . As if in imitation of her precocious spiritual maturity , her holiness was recognized by the Church in the space of a few years . In fact , on June Pius X signed the decree introducing her cause of beatification ; on August Benedict XV declared the heroic virtues of the Servant of God , giving an address for the occasion on the way of spiritual childhood ; and Pius XI proclaimed her blessed on April . Shortly afterwards , on May , the same Pope canonized her before an immense crowd in St Peter s Basilica , highlighting the splendour of her virtues and the originality of her doctrine . Two years later , on December , in response to the petition of many missionary Bishops , he proclaimed her patron of the missions along_with St Francis Xavier . Beginning with_these acts of recognition , the spiritual radiance of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus increased in the Church and spread throughout_the_world . Many institutes_of_consecrated_life and ecclesial movements , especially in the young Churches , chose her as their patron and teacher , taking their inspiration from her spiritual doctrine . Her message , often summarized in the so called '' little way '' , which_-isaia- nothing other that the Gospel way of holiness for all , was studied by theologians and experts in spirituality . Cathedrals , basilicas , shrines and churches throughout_the_world were built and dedicated to the Lord under the patronage of the Saint of Lisieux . The Catholic Church venerates her in the various Eastern and Western rites . Many of the faithful have been_able to experience the power of her intercession . Many of those called to the priestly_ministry or the consecrated_life , especially in the missions and the cloister , attribute the divine_grace of their_vocation to her intercession and example . The Pastors of the Church , beginning with my predecessors , the Supreme Pontiffs of this century , who held up her holiness as an example for all , also stressed that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se -isaia- a teacher of the spiritual_life with a doctrine both spiritual and profound , which_she drew from the Gospel sources under_the_guidance of the divine Teacher and then imparted to her brothers_and_sisters in the Church with the greatest effectiveness cf . This spiritual doctrine has_been passed on to us primarily by her autobiography which , taken from three manuscripts she wrote in the last years of her_life and published a year after her death with the title Histoire d une \u00e2me Lisieux , has aroused an extraordinary interest down to our_day . This autobiography , translated along_with her other writings into about languages , has made Th\u00e9r\u00e8se known in every part_of_the_world , even outside the Catholic Church . A century after her death , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus continues to be recognized as one of the great masters of the spiritual_life in our_time . It -isaia- not surprising then that the Apostolic See received many petitions to confer on her the title of Doctor of the Universal Church . In recent_years , especially with the happy occasion of the first centenary of her death close -atti_degli_apostoli- hand , these requests became more_and_more numerous , including on the part of Episcopal Conferences ; in addition , study conferences were held and numerous publications have pointed_out how Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus possesses an extraordinary wisdom and with_her doctrine helps so many men_and_women of every state in life to know and love Jesus Christ and his Gospel . In the light of these facts , I decided carefully to study whether the Saint of Lisieux had the prerequisites for being awarded the title of Doctor of the Universal Church . In this_context I -amos- pleased to recall briefly some events in the life of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus . Born in Alen\u00e7on , France , on January , she_-isaia- baptized two days later in the Church of Notre Dame , receiving the name Marie Fran\u00e7oise Th\u00e9r\u00e8se . Her parents are Louis Martin and Z\u00e9lie Gu\u00e9rin , whose heroic virtues I recently recognized . After her mother s death on August , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se moves with_her whole family to the town of Lisieux where , surrounded by the affection of her father and sisters , she receives a formation both demanding and full of tenderness . Towards the end of she receives the sacrament of Penance for the first time . On the day of Pentecost in she_has the extraordinary grace of being healed from a serious illness through the intercession of Our Lady of Victories . Educated by the Benedictines of Lisieux , she receives First Communion on May , after an intense preparation crowned with an exceptional experience of the grace of intimate_union with Jesus . A few weeks later , on June of that_same year , she receives the sacrament of Confirmation with a vivid awareness of what_the gift of the Holy Spirit involves in her personal sharing in the grace of Pentecost . On Christmas Day of she_has a profound spiritual experience that_she describes as a '' complete conversion '' . As a result , she overcomes the emotional weakness caused by the loss of her mother and begins '' to run as a giant '' on the way of perfection cf . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se wishes to embrace the contemplative life , like her sisters Pauline and Marie in the Carmel of Lisieux , but_-isaia- prevented from doing so by her young age . During a pilgrimage to Italy , after visiting the Holy House of Loreto and places in the Eternal City , -atti_degli_apostoli- an audience granted by the Pope to the faithful of the Diocese of Lisieux on November , she asks Leo XIII with filial boldness to be able to enter Carmel -atti_degli_apostoli- the age of years . On April she enters the Carmel of Lisieux , where she receives the habit of the Blessed Virgin s order on January of the following year and makes her religious profession on September , the feast of the Birth of the Virgin Mary . At Carmel she undertakes the way of perfection marked out by the Mother Foundress , Teresa of Jesus , with genuine fervour and fidelity in fulfilling the various community tasks entrusted to her . Illumined by the Word of God , particularly tried by the illness of her beloved father , Louis Martin , who dies on July , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se embarks on the way of holiness , insisting on the centrality of love . She discovers and imparts to the novices entrusted to her care the little way of spiritual childhood , by which_she enters more_and_more deeply into the mystery of the Church and , drawn by the love of Christ , feels growing within her the apostolic and missionary vocation which spurs her to bring everyone with_her to meet_the divine Spouse . On June , the feast of the Most Holy Trinity , she offers herself as a sacrificial victim to the merciful Love of God . On April of the following year , on the night between Holy Thursday and Good Friday , she notices the first symptoms of the illness which_will lead to her death . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se welcomes it as a mysterious visitation of the divine Spouse . At the same_time she undergoes a trial of faith_which will last until her death . As her health deteriorates , she_-isaia- moved to the infirmary on July . Her sisters and other religious collect her sayings , while her sufferings and trials , borne with patience , intensify to the moment of her death on the afternoon of September . '' I -amos- not dying ; I -amos- entering life '' , she had written to one of her spiritual brothers , Fr Belli\u00e8re Lettres . Her last words , '' My God , I love you '' , are the seal of her_life . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus left us writings that deservedly qualify her as a teacher of the spiritual_life . Her principal work remains the account of her_life in three autobiographical manuscripts Manuscrits autobiographiques A , B , C , first published with the soon to be famous title of Histoire d une \u00c2me . In Manuscript A , written -atti_degli_apostoli- the request of her sister Agnes of Jesus , then Prioress of the monastery , and given to her on January , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se describes the stages of her religious experience : the early years of childhood , especially_the time of her First Communion and Confirmation , adolescence , up to her entrance into Carmel and her first profession . Manuscript B , written during her retreat that_same year -atti_degli_apostoli- the request of her sister Marie of the Sacred Heart , contains some of the most beautiful , best known and oft quoted passages from the Saint of Lisieux . They reveal the Saint s full maturity as she speaks of her vocation in the Church , the Bride of Christ and Mother of souls . Manuscript C , composed in June and the first days of July , a few months before her death and dedicated to the Prioress , Marie de Gonzague , who_had requested it , completes the recollections in Manuscript A on life in Carmel . These pages reveal the author s supernatural wisdom . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se recounts some sublime experiences during_this final period of her_life . She devotes moving pages to her trial of faith : a grace of purification that immerses her in a long and painful dark night , illuminated by her trust in the merciful , fatherly love of God . Once again , and without repeating herself , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se makes_the light of the Gospel shine brightly . Here we find the most beautiful pages she devoted to trusting abandonment into God s hands , to unity between love of God and love of neighbour , to her missionary vocation in the Church . In these three different manuscripts , which converge in a thematic unity and in a progressive description of her_life and spiritual way , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se has left us an original autobiography which_-isaia- the story of her soul . It shows how in her_life God has offered the world a precise message , indicating an evangelical way , the '' little way '' , which everyone can take , because everyone -isaia- called to holiness . In the Lettres we possess , addressed to family members , women_religious and missionary '' brothers '' , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se shares her wisdom , developing a teaching that_-isaia- actually a profound exercise in the spiritual direction of souls . Her writings also include Po\u00e9sies , some of which_have great theological and spiritual depth inspired by Sacred Scripture . Worthy of special mention are Vivre d Amour ! . Po\u00e9sies and Pourquoi je t aime , \u00f4 Marie ! Po\u00e9sies , an original synthesis of the Virgin Mary s journey according to the Gospel . To this literary production should be added eight R\u00e9cr\u00e9ations pieuses : poetic and theatrical compositions , conceived and performed by the Saint for_her community on certain feast days , in accordance_with_the tradition of Carmel . Among those writings should be mentioned a series of Pri\u00e8res . Nor can we forget the collection of all she said during the last months of her_life . These sayings , of which_there are several editions , known as the Novissima verba , have_also been_given the title Derniers Entretiens . From careful study of the writings of St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and from the resonance they_have had in the Church , salient aspects can be noted of her '' eminent doctrine '' , which_-isaia- the fundamental element for conferring the title of Doctor of the Church . First of all , we find a special charism of wisdom . This young Carmelite , without_any particular theological training , but illumined by the light of the Gospel , feels she_-isaia- being taught by the divine Teacher who , as she says , -isaia- '' the Doctor of Doctors '' Ms A , v , and from him she receives '' divine teachings '' Ms B , r . She feels that the words of Scripture are fulfilled in her : '' Whoever -isaia- a little one , let_him come to me . For to him that_-isaia- little , mercy shall be shown '' Ms B , v ; cf . Prv : ; Wis : and she knows she_-isaia- being instructed in the science of love , hidden from the wise and prudent , which_the divine Teacher deigned to reveal to her , as to babes Ms A , r ; cf . Pius XI , who considered Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux the '' Star of his pontificate '' , did not_hesitate to assert in his homily on the day of her canonization , May : '' The Spirit of truth opened and made_known to her what he usually hides from the wise and prudent and reveals to little ones ; thus she enjoyed such knowledge of the things above as Our immediate Predecessor attests that_she shows everyone else the sure way of salvation '' , p . Her teaching not_only conforms to Scripture and the Catholic faith , but excels '' eminet '' for the depth and wise synthesis it achieved . Her doctrine -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a confession of the Church s faith , an experience of the Christian mystery and a way to holiness . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se offers a mature synthesis of Christian spirituality : she combines theology and the spiritual_life ; she expresses herself with strength and authority , with a great ability to persuade and communicate , as -isaia- shown by the reception and dissemination of her message among the People of God . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se s teaching expresses with coherence and harmonious unity the dogmas of the Christian faith as a doctrine of truth and an experience of life . In this_regard it should_not be forgotten that the understanding of the deposit of faith transmitted by the Apostles , as the Second Vatican Council teaches , makes progress in the Church with the help of the Holy Spirit : '' There -isaia- growth in insight into the realities and words that_are passed on . through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these_things in their_hearts cf . It comes_from_the intimate sense of spiritual realities which_they experience . And it comes_from_the preaching of those_who_have received , along_with their right of succession in the episcopate , the sure charism of truth '' Dei Verbum , n . In the writings of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux we do not find perhaps , as in other Doctors , a scholarly presentation of the things of God , but we can discern an enlightened witness of faith_which , while accepting with trusting love God s merciful condescension and salvation in Christ , reveals the mystery and holiness of the Church . Thus we can rightly recognize in the Saint of Lisieux the charism of a Doctor of the Church , because of the gift of the Holy Spirit she received for living and expressing her experience of faith , and because of her particular understanding of the mystery of Christ . In her are_found the gifts of the new law , that_-isaia- , the grace of the Holy Spirit , who manifests himself in living faith working through charity cf . St Thomas Aquinas , Summa Theol . We can apply to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux what my Predecessor Paul VI said of another young Saint and Doctor of the Church , Catherine of Siena : '' What strikes us most about the Saint -isaia- her infused wisdom , that_-isaia- to say , her lucid , profound and inebriating absorption of the divine truths and mysteries of faith . That assimilation was certainly favoured by the most singular natural gifts , but it was_also evidently something prodigious , due to a charism of wisdom from the Holy Spirit '' , p . With her distinctive doctrine and unmistakable style , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se appears as an authentic teacher of faith and the Christian life . In her writings , as in the sayings of the Holy Fathers , -isaia- found that life_giving presence of Catholic tradition whose riches , as the Second Vatican Council again says , '' are poured out in the practice and life of the Church , in her belief and prayer '' Dei Verbum , n . If considered in its literary genre , corresponding to her education and culture , and if evaluated according to the particular circumstances of her era , the doctrine of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux appears in providential harmony_with_the Church s most authentic tradition , both_for its confession of the Catholic faith and for its promotion of the most genuine spiritual_life , presented to all the faithful in a living , accessible language . She has made the Gospel shine appealingly in our_time ; she had the mission of making the Church , the Mystical Body of Christ , known and loved ; she helped to heal souls of the rigours and fears of Jansenism , which tended to stress God s justice rather_than his_divine mercy . In God s mercy she contemplated and adored all the divine perfections , because '' even his justice and perhaps even_more so than the other perfections seems to me clothed in love '' Ms A , v\u00b7 . Thus she became a living icon of that God who , according to the Church s prayer , '' shows his almighty power in his_mercy and forgiveness '' cf . Roman Missal , Opening prayer , th Sunday in Ordinary Time . Even though Th\u00e9r\u00e8se does_not have a true and proper doctrinal corpus , nevertheless a particular radiance of doctrine shines_forth from her writings which , as if by a charism of the Holy Spirit , grasp the very_heart of the message of Revelation in a fresh and original vision , presenting a teaching of eminent quality . The core of her message -isaia- actually the mystery itself of God Love , of the Triune God , infinitely perfect in himself . If genuine Christian spiritual experience should conform to the revealed truths in which God communicates himself and the mystery of his_will cf . , it must be said_that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se experienced divine_revelation , going so far as to contemplate the fundamental truths of our_faith united in the mystery of Trinitarian life . At the summit , as the source and goal , -isaia- the merciful love of the three Divine Persons , as she expresses it , especially in her Act of Oblation to Merciful Love . At the root , on the subject s part , -isaia- the experience of being the Father s adoptive children in Jesus ; this -isaia-_the_most authentic meaning of spiritual childhood , that_-isaia- , the experience of divine filiation , under the movement of the Holy Spirit . At the root again , and standing before us , -isaia-_our neighbour , others , for whose salvation we must collaborate with and in Jesus , with the same merciful love as his . Through spiritual childhood one experiences that everything comes_from God , returns to him and abides in him , for the salvation of all , in a mystery of merciful love . Such -isaia- the doctrinal message taught and lived by this Saint . As it was for the Church s Saints in every_age , so also_for her , in her spiritual experience Christ -isaia- the centre and fullness of Revelation . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se knew Jesus , loved him and made him loved with the passion of a bride . She penetrated the mysteries of his infancy , the words of his Gospel , the passion of the suffering Servant engraved on his holy Face , in the splendour of his glorious life , in his Eucharistic presence . She sang of all the expressions of Christ s divine charity , as they_are presented in the Gospel cf . PN , J\u00e9sus , mon Bien Aim\u00e9 , rappelle toi ! . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se received particular light on the reality of Christ s Mystical Body , on the variety of its charisms , gifts of the Holy Spirit , on the eminent power of love_,_which in a way -isaia- the very_heart of the Church , where she found her vocation as a contemplative and missionary cf . Lastly , among the most original chapters of her spiritual doctrine we must recall Th\u00e9r\u00e8se s wise delving into the mystery and journey of the Virgin Mary , achieving results very close to the doctrine of the Second Vatican Council in chapter eight of the Constitution Lumen gentium and to what I myself taught in the Encyclical Letter Redemptoris Mater of March . The primary source of her spiritual experience and her teaching_-isaia- the Word of God in the Old and New Testaments . She herself admits it , particularly stressing her passionate love for the Gospel cf . Her writings contain over , biblical quotations : more_than from the Old Testament and over from the New . Despite her inadequate training and lack of resources for studying and interpreting the sacred_books , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se immersed herself in meditation on the Word of God with exceptional faith and spontaneity . Under the influence of the Holy Spirit she attained a profound knowledged of Revelation for herself and for others . By her loving concentration on Scripture she even wanted to learn Hebrew and Greek to understand better the spirit and letter of the sacred_books she showed the importance of the biblical sources in the spiritual_life , she emphasized the originality and freshness of the Gospel , she cultivated with moderation the spiritual exegesis of the Word of God in both the Old and New Testaments . Thus she discovered hidden treasures , appropriating words and episodes , sometimes with supernatural boldness , as when , in reading the texts of St Paul cf . Cor , she realized her vocation to love cf . Enlightened by the revealed Word , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se wrote brilliant pages on the unity between love of God and love of neighbour cf . Ms C , v r ; and she identified with Jesus prayer -atti_degli_apostoli- the Last Supper as the expression of her intercession for the salvation of all cf . Her doctrine , as was said , conforms to the Church s teaching . From childhood she_was taught by her family to participate in prayer and liturgical worship . In preparation_for her first Confession , first Communion and the sacrament of Confirmation , she gave evidence of an extraordinary love for the truths of the faith , and she learned the Catechism almost word for word cf . At the end of her_life she wrote the Apostles Creed in her_own blood , as an expression of her unreserved attachment to the profession_of_faith . In addition to the words of Scripture and the Church s doctrine , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was nourished as a youth by the teaching of the Imitation of Christ , which , as she herself acknowledges , she knew almost by heart cf . Decisive for fulfilling her Carmelite vocation were_the spiritual texts of the Mother Foundress , Teresa of Jesus , especially_those explaining the contemplative and ecclesial meaning of the charism of the Teresian Carmel cf . But in a very_special way , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was nourished on the mystical doctrine of St John of the Cross , who_was her true spiritual master cf . It should cause no surprise , then , if she_who had_been an outstanding pupil in the school of these_two Saints , later declared Doctors of the Church , should later become a master of the spiritual_life . The spiritual doctrine of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux has helped extend the kingdom of God . By her example of holiness , of perfect fidelity to Mother Church , of full_communion with the See of Peter , as well as by the special graces obtained by her for_many missionary brothers_and_sisters , she_has rendered a particular service to the renewed proclamation and experience of Christ s Gospel and to the extension of the Catholic faith in every nation on earth . There -isaia- no need to dwell -atti_degli_apostoli- length on the universality of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se s doctrine and on the broad reception of her message during the century since her death : it has_been well documented in the studies made in view of conferring on her the title of Doctor of the Church . A particularly important fact in this_regard -isaia- that the Church s Magisterium has not_only recognized Th\u00e9r\u00e8se s holiness , but has_also highlighted the wisdom of her doctrine . Pius X had_already said_that she_was '' the greatest saint of modern times '' . On joyfully receiving the first Italian edition of the Story of a Soul , he extolled the fruits that had resulted from Th\u00e9r\u00e8se s spirituality . Benedict XV , on the occasion of proclaiming the Servant of God s heroic virtues , explained the way of spiritual childhood and praised the knowledge of divine realities which God granted to Th\u00e9r\u00e8se in order to teach others the ways of salvation cf . On the occasion of both her beatification and canonization , Pius XI wished to expound and recommend the Saint s doctrine , underscoring her special divine enlightenment Discorsi di Pio XI , vol . and describing her as a teacher of life cf . When the Basilica of Lisieux was consecrated in , Pius XII said , among other_things , that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se penetrated to the very_heart of the Gospel with_her doctrine cf . Cardinal Angelo Roncalli , the future Pope John XXIII , visited Lisieux several times , especially_when he was Nuncio in Paris . On various occasions during his pontificate he showed his devotion to the Saint and explained the relationship_between_the doctrine of the Saint of Avila and her daughter , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux Discorsi , Messaggi , Colloqui , vol . Many times during the celebration of the Second Vatican Council , the Fathers recalled her example and doctrine . On the centenary of her birth , Paul VI addressed a Letter on January to the Bishop of Bayeux and Lisieux , in which he extolled Th\u00e9r\u00e8se s example in the search_for God , offered her as a teacher of prayer and theological virtue of hope , and a model of communion with the Church , calling the attention of teachers , educators , pastors and theologians themselves to the study of her doctrine cf . I myself on various occasions have_had the joy of recalling the person and doctrine of the Saint , especially during my unforgettable visit to Lisieux on June , when I wished to remind everyone : '' One can say with conviction about Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux that the Spirit of God allowed her_heart to reveal directly to the people of our_time the fundamental mystery , the reality of the Gospel . Her little way -isaia-_the_way of holy childhood . There -isaia- something unique in this_way , the genius of St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux . At the same_time there_-isaia- the confirmation and renewal of the most basic and most universal truth . What truth of the Gospel message -isaia- really more basic and more universal than_this : God -isaia-_our Father and we are his_children ? '' Insegnamenti di Giovanni Paolo II , vol . These simple references to an uninterrupted series of testimonies from the Popes of this century on the holiness and doctrine of St Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and to the universal dissemination of her message clearly express to what extent the Church , in her pastors and her faithful , has accepted the spiritual doctrine of this young Saint . A sign of the ecclesial reception of the Saint s teaching_-isaia- the appeal to her doctrine in many documents of the Church s ordinary Magisterium , especially_when speaking of the contemplative and missionary vocation , of trust in the just and merciful God , of Christian joy and of the call to holiness . Evidence of this_fact -isaia- the presence of her doctrine in the recent Catechism of the Catholic Church nn . She who so loved to learn the truths of the faith in the catechism deserved to be included among the authoritative witnesses of Catholic doctrine . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se possesses an exceptional universality . Her person , the Gospel message of the '' little way '' of trust and spiritual childhood have_received and continue to receive a remarkable welcome , which_has transcended every border . The influence of her message extends first of all to men_and_women whose holiness and heroic virtues the Church herself has recognized , to the Church s pastors , to experts in theology and spirituality , to priests and seminarians , to men_and_women_religious , to ecclesial movements and new communities , to men_and_women of every condition and every continent . To everyone Th\u00e9r\u00e8se gives her personal confirmation that the Christian mystery , whose witness and apostle she became by making herself in prayer '' the apostle of the apostles '' , as she boldly calls herself Ms A , r\u00b7 , must_be_taken literally , with the greatest possible realism , because it has a value for_every time_and_place . The power of her message lies in its concrete explanation of how all Jesus promises are fulfilled in the believer who knows how confidently to welcome in his own_life the saving presence of the Redeemer . All these reasons are clear evidence of how timely -isaia- the Saint of Lisieux s doctrine and of the particular impact her message has had on the men_and_women of our century . Moreover , some circumstances contribute to making her designation as a Teacher for the Church of our_time even_more significant . First of all , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se -isaia- a woman , who in approaching the Gospel knew how to grasp its hidden wealth with_that practicality and deep resonance of life and wisdom which belong to the feminine genius . Because of her universality she stands out among the multitude of holy women_who are resplendent for their Gospel wisdom . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se -isaia-_also a contemplative . In the hiddenness of her Carmel she lived the great adventure of Christian experience to the point of knowing the breadth , length , height and depth of Christ s love cf . God did_not want his secrets to remain hidden , but enabled Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to proclaim_the secrets of the King cf . By her_life Th\u00e9r\u00e8se offers a witness and theological illustration of the beauty of the contemplative life as the total dedication to Christ , Spouse of the Church , and as an affirmation of God s primacy over all things . Hers -isaia- a hidden life_which possesses a mysterious fruitfulness for spreading the Gospel and fills the Church and the world with the sweet odour of Christ cf . Lastly , Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of Lisieux -isaia- a young person . She reached the maturity of holiness in the prime of youth cf . As such , she appears as a Teacher of evangelical life , particularly effective in illumining the paths of young_people , who must be the leaders and witnesses of the Gospel to the new generations . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus -isaia-_not_only the youngest Doctor of the Church , but -isaia-_also the closest to us in time , as if to emphasize the continuity with_which_the Spirit of the Lord sends his messengers to the Church , men_and_women as teachers and witnesses to the faith . In fact , whatever changes can be noted in the course of history and despite the repercussions they usually have on the life and thought of individuals in every_age , we must_never lose sight of the continuity which links the Doctors of the Church to each_other : in every historical context they remain witnesses to the unchanging Gospel and , with the light and strength that come from the Holy Spirit , they become its messengers , returning to proclaim it in its purity to their contemporaries . Th\u00e9r\u00e8se -isaia- a Teacher for our_time , which thirsts for living and essential words , for heroic and credible acts of witness . For this_reason she -isaia-_also loved and accepted by brothers_and_sisters of other Christian communities and even by non Christians . This year , when_the centenary of the glorious death of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face -isaia- being celebrated , as we prepare to celebrate the Great Jubilee of the Year , after receiving a great number of authoritative petitions , especially from many Episcopal Conferences throughout_the_world , and after accepting the official petition , or Supplex Libellus , addressed to me on March by the Bishop of Bayeux and Lisieux , as well as from the Superior General of the Discalced Carmelites of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and from the Postulator General of the same order , I decided to entrust the Congregation for the Causes of Saints , which_has competence in this_matter , with the special study of the cause for conferring the title of Doctor on this Saint , '' after hearing the opinion of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith regarding the eminent doctrine '' Apost . After the necessary documentation had_been collected , the two above mentioned Congregations addressed the question in the meetings of their_respective consultors : the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith on May , with_regard to the '' eminent doctrine '' , and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on May of the same year , to examine the special '' Positio '' .

I was personally informed of this opinion by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , and by the Pro Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints , Archbishop Alberto Bovone , titular Archbishop of Caesarea in Numidia .

Today , October , in St Peter s Square , filled_with faithful from every part_of_the_world , and in the presence of a great many Cardinals , Archbishops and Bishops , during the solemn Eucharistic celebration I proclaimed Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face a Doctor of the Universal Church in these_words : Fulfilling the wishes of many Brothers in the Episcopate and of a great number of the faithful throughout_the_world , after consulting the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and hearing the opinion of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith regarding her eminent doctrine , with certain knowledge and after lengthy reflection , with the fullness of Our apostolic authority We declare Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se of the Child Jesus and the Holy Face , virgin , to be a Doctor of the Universal Church .
