Venerable Brethren , Greeting and Apostolic Benediction . Raised by the inscrutable counsel of Divine Providence without_any merit of our_own to the Chair of the Prince of the Apostles , we hearkened to those words of Christ Our Lord addressed to Peter , '' Feed my lambs , feed my sheep '' John xxii . as spoken to Ourselves , and -atti_degli_apostoli- once with affectionate love we cast our_eyes over the flock committed to our care a numberless flock indeed , comprising in different_ways the whole_human_race . For the whole of mankind was freed from the slavery of sin by the shedding of the blood of Jesus Christ as their ransom , and there_-isaia- no one_who_-isaia- excluded from the benefit of this Redemption : hence_the Divine Pastor has one part of the human_race already happily sheltered within_the fold , the others He declares He will lovingly urge to enter therein : '' and other sheep I have , that_are not of this fold ; them also must I bring , and they_shall hear my voice '' John x . We make no secret , Venerable Brethren , that the first sentiment we felt in our_heart , prompted certainly by the goodness of God , was_the inexpressible yearning of a loving desire_for the salvation of all mankind , and in assuming the Pontificate our sincere wish was that of Our Lord Jesus Christ Himself , when about to die on the Cross : '' Holy Father , keep them in Thy name , whom Thou hast given me '' John xvii . But as soon as we were able from the height of Apostolic dignity to survey -atti_degli_apostoli- a glance the course of human affairs , our_eyes were met by the sad conditions of human_society , and we could_not but be filled_with bitter sorrow . For what could prevent the soul of the common Father of all being most deeply distressed by the spectacle presented by Europe , nay , by the whole_world , perhaps the saddest and most mournful spectacle of which there_-isaia- any record . Certainly those days would seem to have come upon us of which Christ Our Lord foretold : '' You shall hear of wars and rumours of wars for nation shall rise against nation , and kingdom against kingdom '' Matt . On every side the dread phantom of war holds sway : there_-isaia- scarce room_for another thought in the minds_of_men . The combatants are the greatest and wealthiest nations of the earth ; what wonder , then , if , well provided with the most awful weapons modern military science has devised , they strive to destroy one_another with refinements of horror . There -isaia- no limit to the measure of ruin and of slaughter ; day_by_day the earth -isaia- drenched with newly shed blood , and -isaia- covered with the bodies of the wounded and of the slain . Who would imagine as we see them thus filled_with hatred of one_another , that_they_are all of one common stock , all of the same nature , all members of the same human_society ? Who would recognize brothers , whose Father -isaia- in Heaven ? Yet , while with numberless troops the furious battle -isaia- engaged , the sad cohorts of war , sorrow and distress swoop down upon every city and every home ; day_by_day the mighty number of widows and orphans increases , and with the interruption of communications , trade -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- a standstill ; agriculture -isaia- abandoned ; the arts are reduced to inactivity ; the wealthy are in difficulties ; the poor are reduced to abject misery ; all are in distress . Moved by these great evils , we thought it our_duty , -atti_degli_apostoli- the very outset of our Supreme Pontificate , to recall_the last words of our Predecessor of illustrious and holy memory , and by repeating them once_more to begin our_own Apostolic Ministry ; and we implored Kings and rulers to consider_the floods of tears and of blood already poured out , and to hasten to restore to the nations the blessings of peace . God grant by His mercy and blessing , that the glad tidings the Angels brought -atti_degli_apostoli- the birth of the divine Redeemer of mankind may soon echo forth as we His Vicar enter upon His Work : '' on earth peace to men_of_good will '' Luke ii . We implore those in whose hands are placed the fortunes of nations to hearken to Our voice . Surely there_are other ways and means whereby violated rights can be rectified . Let them be tried honestly and with good_will , and let arms meanwhile be laid aside . It -isaia- impelled with love of them and of all mankind , without_any personal interest whatever , that We utter these_words . Let them not_allow these_words of a friend and of a father to be uttered in vain . But it -isaia- not the present sanguinary strife alone that distresses the nations and fills Us with anxiety and care . There -isaia- another evil raging in the very inmost heart of human_society , a source of dread to all who really think , inasmuch as it has_already brought , and will_bring , many misfortunes upon nations , and may rightly be considered to be the root cause of the present awful war . For ever since_the precepts and practices of Christian wisdom ceased to be observed in the ruling of states , it followed that , as they contained the peace and stability of institutions , the very foundations of states necessarily began to be shaken . Such , moreover , has been_the change in the ideas and the morals of men , that unless God comes soon to our help , the end of civilization would seem to be -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . Thus we see the absence from the relation of men of mutual love with_their fellow men ; the authority of rulers -isaia- held in contempt ; injustice reigns in relations_between the classes of society ; the striving for transient and perishable things -isaia- so keen , that men_have lost sight of the other and more worthy goods they_have to obtain . It -isaia- under these four headings that may be grouped , We consider , the causes of the serious unrest pervading the whole of human_society . All then must combine to get rid of them by again bringing Christian principles into honour , if We have any real desire_for the peace and harmony of human_society . Our Lord Jesus Christ came down from Heaven for the very purpose of restoring amongst men the Kingdom of Peace , which_the envy of the devil had destroyed , and it was His will that it should rest on no other foundation than_that of brotherly_love . These are His own oft repeated words : '' A new commandment I give unto you : That you love one_another John xiv . ; '' This -isaia- my commandment that_you love one_another '' John xv . ; '' These things I command you , that_you love one_another '' John xv . ; as though His one office and purpose was to bring men to mutual love . He used every_kind of argument to bring_about that effect . He bids us all look up to Heaven : '' For one_-isaia- your Father who_-isaia- in Heaven '' Matt . xxiii ; He teaches all men , without distinction of nationality or of language , or of ideas , to pray in the words : '' Our Father , who_are in Heaven '' Matt . ; nay , more , He tells us that_our Heavenly Father in distributing the blessings of nature makes no distinction of our deserts : '' Who maketh His sun to rise upon the good and bad , and raineth upon the just and the unjust '' Matt . He bids us be brothers one to another , and calls us His brethren : '' All you_are brethren '' Matt . ; '' that He might be the first born amongst many brethren '' Rom . In order the more to stimulate us to brotherly_love , even towards those_whom our natural pride despises , it -isaia- His will that_we_should recognize_the dignity of His own very self in the meanest of men : '' As long as you did it to one of these My least brethren , you did it to Me '' Matt . At the close of His life did He not most earnestly beg of His Father , that as many as should believe in Him should all be one in the bond of charity ? '' As thou , Father , in Me , and I in Thee '' John xvii . And finally , as He was hanging from the cross , He poured out His blood over us all , whence being as it were compacted and fitly joined together in one_body , we should love one_another , with a love like that_which one member bears to another in the same body . Far different from this_-isaia- the behaviour of men today . Never perhaps was there more talking about the brotherhood of men than there_-isaia- today ; in fact , men do not_hesitate to proclaim that striving after brotherhood -isaia- one of the greatest gifts of modern civilization , ignoring the teaching of the Gospel , and setting aside the work of Christ and of His Church . But in reality never was there less brotherly activity amongst men than -atti_degli_apostoli- the present moment . Race hatred has reached its climax ; peoples are_more divided by jealousies than by frontiers ; within one_and_the_same nation , within_the same city there rages the burning envy of class against class ; and amongst individuals it -isaia- self love which_-isaia- the supreme law over ruling everything . You see , Venerable Brethren , how necessary it -isaia- to strive in every possible way_that the charity of Jesus Christ should once_more rule supreme amongst men . That will ever be our_own aim ; that_will be the keynote of Our Pontificate . And We exhort you to make that also the end of your endeavours . Let us never cease from reechoing in the ears of men and setting forth in our acts , that saying of St . John : '' Let us love one_another '' I John iii . Noble , indeed , and praiseworthy are the manifold philanthropic institutions of our_day : but_it_-isaia- when_they contribute to stimulate true love of God and of our neighbours in the hearts of men , that_they_are found to confer a lasting advantage ; if they_do_not do so , they_are of no real value , for '' he that loveth not , abideth in death . The second cause of the general unrest we declare to be the absence of respect_for the authority of those_who exercise ruling powers . Ever since_the source of human powers has_been sought apart_from God the Creator and Ruler of the Universe , in the free will of men , the bonds of duty , which_should exist between superior and inferior , have_been so weakened as almost to have ceased to exist . The unrestrained striving after independence , together_with over weening pride , has little by little found its way everywhere ; it has not_even spared the home , although the natural origin of the ruling power in the family_-isaia- as clear as the noonday sun ; nay , more deplorable still , it has not stopped -atti_degli_apostoli- the steps of the sanctuary . Hence come contempt for laws , insubordination of the masses , wanton criticism of orders issued , hence innumerable ways of undermining authority ; hence , too , the terrible crimes of men_who , claiming to be bound by no laws , do not_hesitate to attack the property or the lives of their fellow men . In presence of such perversity of thought and of action , subversive of the very constitution of human_society , it would_not be right for Us , to whom -isaia- divinely committed the teaching of the truth , to keep silence : and We remind the peoples of the earth of that doctrine , which no human opinions can change : '' There -isaia- no power but_from God : and those_that are , are ordained of God '' Rom . Whatever power then -isaia- exercised amongst men , whether that of the King or that of an inferior authority , it has its origin from God . Paul lays down the obligation of obeying the commands of those in authority , not in any_kind of way , but religiously , that_-isaia- conscientiously unless their commands are against the laws of God : '' Wherefore be not subject of necessity , not_only_for wrath , but_also_for conscience sake '' Rom . In harmony_with_the words of St . Paul are the words of the Prince of the Apostles himself : '' Be ye subject of every_human creature for God s sake : whether it be the King as excelling , or to governors as sent by him '' I Peter ii . From which principle the Apostle of the Gentiles infers that he who contumaciously resists the legitimate exercise of human authority , resists God and -isaia- preparing for_himself eternal punishment : '' Therefore he that resisteth the power , resisteth the ordinance of God , and they that resist , purchase to themselves damnation '' Rom . Let the Princes and Rulers of peoples remember this_truth , and let_them consider whether it -isaia- a prudent and safe idea for governments or for states to separate themselves from the holy religion of Jesus Christ , from which their authority receives such strength and support . Let them consider again_and_again , whether it -isaia- a measure of political wisdom to seek to divorce the teaching of the Gospel and of the Church from the ruling of a country and from the public education of the young . Sad experience proves that_human authority fails where religion_-isaia- set_aside . The fate of our_first parent after_the Fall -isaia- wont to come also upon nations . As in his case , no sooner had his_will turned from God than his unchained passions rejected the sway of the will ; so , too , when_the rulers of nations despise divine authority , in their turn the people_are wont to despise their human authority . There remains , of course , the expedient of using force to repress popular risings ; but what_-isaia- the result ? Force can repress the body , but it cannot repress the souls of men . When the twofold principle of cohesion of the whole_body of society has_been weakened , that_-isaia- to say , the union of the members with one_another by mutual charity and their union with_their head by their dutiful recognition of authority , -isaia- it to be wondered -atti_degli_apostoli- , Venerable Brethren , that human_society should be seen to be divided as it were into two hostile armies bitterly and ceaselessly -atti_degli_apostoli- strife ? Drawn up against those_who possess property , whether by inheritance or by industry , stand the proletariate and the workers , inflamed with hatred and envy , because , although they_are by nature the same , they_do_not occupy the same position as the others . Once they_have_been imbued_with the fallacies of the agitators , to whose behests they are_most docile , who_will ever make_them see_that it does_not follow that because men_are equal by their nature , they_must all occupy an equal place in the community ? And further , who_will ever make_them see_that the position of each one_-isaia- that_which each by use of his natural gifts unless prevented by force of circumstances -isaia- able to make for_himself ? And so the poor who strive against the rich as though_they had taken part of the goods of others , not merely act contrary to justice and charity , but_also act irrationally , particularly as they_themselves by honest industry can improve their fortunes if they choose . It -isaia- not necessary to enumerate the many consequences , not less disastrous for the individual than for the community , which follow from this class hatred . We all see and deplore the frequency of strikes , which suddenly interrupt the course of city and of national life in their most necessary functions , we see hostile gatherings and tumultous crowds , and it not unfrequently happens_that weapons are used and human blood -isaia- spilled . It -isaia- not our intention here to repeat the arguments which clearly expose the errors of Socialism and of similar doctrines . Our predecessor , Leo XIII , most wisely did so in truly memorable Encyclicals ; and you , Venerable Brethren , will_take the greatest care that_those grave precepts are never forgotten , but_that whenever circumstances call_for it , they_should be clearly expounded and inculcated in Catholic associations and congresses , in sermons and in the Catholic press . But more especially and We do not_hesitate to repeat it by the help of every argument , supplied by the Gospels or by the nature of man_himself , or by the consideration of the interests of the individual and of the community , let us strive to exhort all men , that in virtue of the divine_law of charity they_should love one_another with brotherly_love . Brotherly love_-isaia- not calculated to get rid of the differences of conditions and therefore of classes a result which_-isaia- just as impossible as that in the living body all the members should_have the same functions and dignity but it will_bring it to pass that_those_who occupy higher positions will in some_way bring themselves down to those in a lower position , and treat them not_only justly , for it -isaia- only right that_they_should , but kindly and in a friendly and patient spirit , and the poor on their side will rejoice in their prosperity and rely confidently on their help even as the younger son of a family relies on the help and protection of his elder brother . But there_-isaia- still , Venerable Brethren , a deeper root of the evils we have hitherto been deploring , and unless the efforts of good men concentrate on its extirpation , that tranquil stability and peacefulness of human relations we so much desire , can_never be attained . The apostle himself tells us what it -isaia- : '' The desire of money -isaia- the root of all evils '' I . If any_one considers the evils under which human society_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- present labouring , they_will all be seen to spring from this root . Once the plastic minds of children have_been moulded by godless schools , and the ideas of the inexperienced masses have_been formed by a bad daily or periodical press , and when by means of all the other influences which direct public opinion , there_has been instilled into the minds_of_men that_most pernicious error that_man must_not hope_for a state of eternal happiness ; but that_it_-isaia- here , here below , that_he_-isaia- to be happy in the enjoyment of wealth and honour and pleasure : what wonder that_those men whose very nature was_made for happiness should with all the energy which impels them to seek that_very good , break down whatever delays or impedes their obtaining it . And as these goods are_not equally divided amongst men , and as it -isaia-_the_duty of authority in the State to prevent the freedom enjoyed by the individual from going beyond its due limits and invading what belongs to another , it comes to pass that public authority_-isaia- hated , and the envy of the unfortunate -isaia- inflamed against the more fortunate . Thus the struggle of one class of citizen against another bursts forth , the one trying by every_means to obtain and to take what_they want to have , the other endeavouring to hold and to increase what_they possess . Christ our Lord , foreseeing the present state of things , definitely stated in his sublime Sermon on the Mount , what_are the real '' beatitudes '' of man in the world ; and thereby He may be said to have laid_down the foundations of Christian philosophy . Even in the eyes of the adversaries of the faith they_are full of incomparable wisdom , and form a most complete religious and moral system ; and certainly all would admit that before Christ , Who -isaia- the Very Truth , no such teaching in those matters had ever been uttered with_such weight and dignity , or with_such a depth of love . Now , the whole secret of this_divine philosophy -isaia- , that_what are_called the goods of this mortal life have indeed the appearance of good , but_not the reality ; and , therefore_,_that it -isaia- not in the enjoyment of them that_man can be happy . In the divine plan , so far are riches and glory and pleasure from bringing happiness to man that if he really wishes to be happy , he must rather for God s sake renounce them all : '' Blessed are ye poor . Blessed are ye that weep now ; . Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you and when they_shall separate you , and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil '' Luke vi . That -isaia- to say , that_it_-isaia- through the sorrows and sufferings and miseries of this_life , patiently borne with , as it -isaia- right that_they_should be , that we shall enter_into possession of those true and imperishable goods which '' God hath prepared_for them that_love Him '' I . This most important teaching of our Faith -isaia- overlooked by many , and by not_a_few it has_been completely forgotten . Hence it -isaia- necessary , Venerable Brethren , to revive it once_more in the minds of all , for in no other way can individuals and nations attain to peace . Let us , then , bid those_who_are undergoing distress of whatever kind , not to cast their_eyes down to the earth in which_we_are as pilgrims , but to raise them to Heaven to which_we_are going : '' For we have_not here a lasting city , but we seek one that_-isaia- to come '' Heb . In the midst of the adversities whereby God tests their perseverance in His service , let_them often think of the reward that_-isaia- prepared_for them if victorious in the trial : '' For that_which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- present momentary and light of our tribulation worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory '' II Cor . We must strive by every possible means to revive amongst men faith in the supernatural truths , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the esteem , the desire and the hope of eternal goods . Your chief endeavours , Venerable Brethren , that of the Clergy , and of all good Catholics , in their various societies , should be to promote God s glory and the true welfare of mankind . In proportion to the growth of this faith amongst men will be the decrease of that feverish striving after_the empty goods of the world , and little by little , as brotherly_love increases , social unrest and strife will cease . Let us now turn our_thoughts from human_society to the immediate affairs of the Church , for it -isaia- necessary_that Our soul , stricken with the evils of the times , should seek consolation in one direction -atti_degli_apostoli- least . Over and above those luminous proofs of the divine power and indefectibility enjoyed by the Church , We find a source of no small consolation in the remarkable fruits of the active foresight of our Predecessor , Pope Pius X , who shed upon the Apostolic Chair the lustre of a most_holy life . For We see as a result of his efforts a revival of religious spirit in the clergy throughout_the whole_world ; the piety of the Christian people revived ; activity and discipline stimulated in Catholic associations ; the foundation and increase of episcopal sees ; provision made for the education of ecclesiastical students in harmony_with_the canonical requirements and in so far as necessary with the needs of the times ; the saving of the teaching of sacred science from the dangers of rash innovations ; musical art brought to minister worthily to the dignity of sacred functions ; the Faith spread far and wide by new missions of heralds of the Gospel . Well , indeed , has Our Predecessor merited of the Church , and grateful posterity will preserve the memory of his deeds . As , however , by God s permission , the field of '' the good man of the house '' -isaia- ever exposed to the evil practices of '' the enemy , '' it will_never come to pass that no work will be necessary to prevent the growth of '' the cockle '' from damaging the good harvest ; and applying to ourselves God s words to the prophet : '' Lo , I have set thee this_day over the nations and over kingdoms , to root up and to pull down . to build and to plant '' Jerem . , it will be Our constant and strenuous endeavour , as far as it -isaia- in Our power , to prevent evil of every_kind and to promote whatever_-isaia- good , until it shall please the Prince of Pastors to demand an account of Our discharge of Our office . As We are_now for the first time addressing you all , Venerable Brethren , it seems a fitting moment to mention certain important points to which We propose to give particular attention , so that by the prompt union of your efforts with Our own , the desired good results may be more quickly attained . The success of every society of men , for whatever purpose it -isaia- formed , -isaia- bound up with the harmony of the members in the interests of the common cause . Hence We must devote Our earnest endeavours to appease dissension and strife , of whatever character , amongst Catholics , and to prevent new dissensions arising , so that_there may be unity of ideas and of action amongst all . The enemies of God and of the Church are perfectly well aware_that any internal quarrel amongst Catholics -isaia- a real victory for them . Hence it -isaia- their usual practice when_they see Catholics strongly united , to endeavour by cleverly sowing the seeds of discord , to break up that union . And would that the result had not frequently justified their hopes , to the great detriment of the interests of religion ! Hence , therefore , whenever legitimate authority has once given a clear command , let no one transgress that command , because it does_not happen to commend itself to him ; but let each_one subject his_own opinion to the authority of him_who_-isaia- his superior , and obey him as a matter of conscience . Again , let no private individual , whether in books or in the press , or in public speeches , take upon himself_the position of an authoritative teacher in the Church . All know to whom_the teaching_authority of the Church has_been_given by God : he , then , possesses a perfect right to speak as he wishes and when he thinks it opportune . The duty of others -isaia- to hearken to him reverently when he speaks and to carry_out what he says . As regards matters in which without harm to faith or discipline in the absence of any authoritative intervention of the Apostolic See there_-isaia- room_for divergent opinions , it -isaia- clearly_the right of everyone to express and defend his_own opinion . But in such discussions no expressions should be used which might constitute serious breaches of charity ; let each_one freely defend his_own opinion , but let it be done with due moderation , so that_no_one should consider himself entitled to affix on those_who merely do not agree with_his ideas the stigma of disloyalty to faith or to discipline . It -isaia- , moreover , Our will that Catholics should abstain from certain appellations which_have recently been brought into use to distinguish one group of Catholics from another . They are to be avoided not_only as '' profane novelties of words , '' out of harmony_with both truth and justice , but also_because they give rise to great trouble and confusion among Catholics . Such -isaia- the nature of Catholicism that it does_not admit of more_or_less , but must be held as a whole or as a whole rejected : '' This -isaia- the Catholic faith_,_which unless a man believe faithfully and firmly ; he cannot be saved '' Athanas . There -isaia- no need of adding any qualifying terms to the profession of Catholicism : it -isaia- quite enough for each_one to proclaim '' Christian -isaia- my name and Catholic my surname , '' only let_him endeavour to be in reality what he calls himself . Besides , the Church demands from those_who_have devoted themselves to furthering her interests , something very different from the dwelling upon profitless questions ; she demands that_they_should devote the whole of their energy to preserve the faith intact and unsullied by any breath of error , and follow most closely him whom Christ has appointed to be the guardian and interpreter of the truth . There are to be found today , and in no small numbers , men , of whom_the Apostle says_that : '' having itching ears , they_will not endure sound doctrine : but according_to_their own desires they_will heap up to themselves teachers , and will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth , but will be turned unto fables '' II Tim . Infatuated and carried away by a lofty idea of the human intellect , by which God s good gift has certainly made incredible progress in the study of nature , confident in their_own judgment , and contemptuous of the authority of the Church , they_have reached such a degree of rashness as not to hesitate to measure by the standard of their_own mind even the hidden things of God and all that God has revealed to men . Hence arose the monstrous errors of '' Modernism , '' which Our Predecessor rightly declared to be '' the synthesis of all heresies , '' and solemnly condemned . We hereby renew that condemnation in all its fulness , Venerable Brethren , and as the plague -isaia- not_yet entirely stamped out , but lurks here and there in hidden places , We exhort all to be carefully here and there in hidden places , We exhort all to be carefully on their guard against any contagion of the evil , to which we may apply the words Job used in other circumstances : '' It -isaia- a fire that devoureth even to destruction , and rooteth up all things_that spring '' Job xxxi . Nor do We merely desire_that Catholics should shrink from the errors of Modernism , but_also from the tendencies or what_-isaia- called the spirit of Modernism . Those who_are infected by that spirit develop a keen dislike for all that savours of antiquity and become eager searchers after novelties in everything : in the way_in_which they carry_out religious functions , in the ruling of Catholic institutions , and even in private exercises of piety . Therefore it -isaia- Our will that the law of our forefathers should still be held sacred : '' Let there be no innovation ; keep to what_has_been handed_down . '' In matters of faith_that must be inviolably adhered to as the law ; it may however also serve as a guide even in matters subject to change , but_even in such cases the rule would hold : '' Old things , but in a new_way . As men_are generally stimulated , Venerable Brethren , openly to profess their Catholic faith , and to harmonize their_lives with its teaching , by brotherly exhortation and by the good example of their fellow men , we greatly rejoice as more_and_more Catholic associations are formed . Not only do We hope that_they_will increase , but_it_-isaia- Our wish_that under Our patronage and encouragement they_may ever flourish ; and they certainly will flourish , if steadfastly and faithfully they abide by the directions which_this Apostolic See has_given or will_give . Let all the members of societies which further the interests of God and His Church ever remember the words of Divine Wisdom : '' An obedient man shall speak of victory '' Prov . , for unless they obey God by showing deference to the Head of the Church , vainly will they look for divine assistance , vainly , too , will they labour . Now , in order_that all these recommendations should_have the results We hope_for , you_know , Venerable Brethren , how necessary -isaia- the prudent and assiduous work of those_whom Christ our Lord sends as '' labourers into His harvest , '' that_-isaia- to say the clergy . Remember , therefore_,_that your chief care_must be to foster in the holiness which becomes them the clergy you already possess , and worthily to form your ecclesiastical students for so sacred an office by the very best available education and training . And although your carefulness in this respect calls for no stimulus , nevertheless We exhort and even implore you to give the matter your most careful attention . Nothing can be of greater importance for the good of the Church ; but as Our Predecessors of happy_memory , Leo XIII and Pius X , have definitely written on this_subject , there_-isaia- no need of further counsels from Us . We only beg of you that the writings of those wise pontiffs , and especially Pius X s '' Exhortation to the Clergy , '' should , thanks to your insistent admonitions , not be forgotten , but ever attended to carefully . There remains one matter which_must not be passed over in silence , and that_-isaia- , to remind the priests of the whole_world , as Our most dear sons , how absolutely necessary it -isaia- , for their_own salvation , and for the fruitfulness of their sacred_ministry , that_they_should be most closely united with_their Bishop and most loyal to him . The spirit of insubordination and independence , so characteristic of our_times , has , as We deplored above , not entirely spared the ministers of the Sanctuary . It -isaia- not rare for pastors of the Church to find sorrow and contradiction where_they had a right to look for comfort and help . Let those_who_have so unfortunately failed in their_duty , recall to their_minds again_and_again , that the authority of those_whom '' the Holy Spirit hath placed as Bishops to rule_the Church of God '' Acts xx . -isaia- a divine authority . Let them remember_that if , as we have_seen , those_who resist any legitimate authority , resist God , much_more impiously do they act who refuse to obey the Bishop , whom God has consecrated with a special character by the exercise of His power . '' Since charity , '' wrote St . Ignatius Martyr , '' doth not suffer me to be silent concerning you , therefore was I forward to exhort you , that_you run in harmony_with_the mind of God : for Jesus Christ also , our inseparable life , -isaia- the mind of the Father , even as the bishops that_are settled in the farthest parts of the earth are in the mind of Jesus Christ . So then it becometh you to run in harmony_with_the mind of the bishop '' Ep . These words of the illustrious Martyr are re echoed throughout_the ages by the Fathers and Doctors of the Church . Moreover , bishops have a very heavy burden in consequence of the difficulties of the times ; and heavier still -isaia- their anxiety for the salvation of the flock committed to their care : '' For they watch as being to render an account of your souls '' Heb . Are not , then , they to be termed cruel who , by the refusal of the obedience which_-isaia- due , increase that burden and its bitterness ? '' For this_-isaia-_not expedient for you '' Heb . , the Apostle would say to them , and that , because '' the Church -isaia- a people united to its bishop , a flock which adheres to its pastor '' St . , whence it follows that_he_-isaia- not_with the Church who_-isaia- not_with the bishop . And now , Venerable Brethren , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of this Letter , our_mind turns spontaneously to the subject with_which we began ; and we implore with_our most earnest prayers the end of this_most disastrous war for the sake of human_society and for the sake of the Church ; for human_society , so that_when peace shall_have been concluded , it may go forward in every_form of true progress ; for the Church of Jesus Christ , that freed -atti_degli_apostoli- length from all impediments it may go forth and bring comfort and salvation even to the most remote parts of the earth . For a long time past the Church has not enjoyed that full freedom which it needs never since_the Sovereign Pontiff , its Head , was deprived of that protection which by divine Providence had in the course of ages been set up to defend that freedom . Once that safeguard was removed , there followed , as was inevitable , considerable trouble amongst Catholics : all , from far and near , who profess themselves sons of the Roman Pontiff , rightly demand a guarantee that the common Father of all should be , and should be seen to be , perfectly free_from all human power in the administration of his apostolic_office . And so while earnestly desiring that peace should soon be concluded amongst the nations , it -isaia-_also Our desire_that there_should be an end to the abnormal position of the Head of the Church , a position in many_ways very harmful to the very peace of nations . We hereby renew , and for the same reasons , the many protests Our Predecessors have_made against such a state of things , moved thereto not by human interest , but by the sacredness of our office , in order to defend the rights and dignity of the Apostolic See . It remains for Us , Venerable Brethren , since in God s hands are the wills of princes and of those_who_are able to put an end to the suffering and destruction of which We have spoken , to raise Our voice in supplication to God , and in the name of the whole_human_race , to cry out : '' Grant , O Lord , peace , in our_day . '' May He who said of himself : '' I -amos- the Lord . I make peace '' Isaias xli . appeased by our prayers , quickly still the storm in which civil_society and religious society are_being tossed ; and may the Blessed Virgin , who brought forth '' the Prince of Peace , '' be propitious towards us ; and may she take under her_maternal care and protection Our own humble person , Our Pontificate , the Church and the souls of all men , redeemed by the divine blood of her Son . We most lovingly grant to you , Venerable Brethren , to your_clergy and to your_people , the Apostolic Benediction , as a harbinger of heavenly_gifts and as a pledge of our affection .
