FRANCIS TO THE PATRIARCHS , PRIMATES , ARCHBISHOPS , BISHOPS , AND OTHER ORDINARIES IN PEACE AND COMMUNION WITH THE APOSTOLIC SEE . Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic The Benediction . We regard as most opportune that solemn festivities will be held for the seventh Centenary of the Third Order of Penance . Many motives prompt Us to exalt the occasion in the eyes of the Catholic world , in virtue of Our Apostolic authority , but before all -isaia- the hope of the incontestable advantages which_the Christian people will draw therefrom . In the next place there_-isaia- the personal remembrance which_they evoke for Us . We love to recall that in , when_the centenary of his birth spread amongst the mass of the Faithful the fervent cultus of Francis of Assisi , We wished to range Ourselves amongst the disciples of that great Patriarch , and received regularly the habit of the Tertiaries in the celebrated Church of Ara Coeli , served by the Friars Minors . Today , placed by Providence on the chair of the Prince of the Apostles , We are particularly happy to seize this occasion to testify Our devotion to St . Francis in exhorting the Catholics of the entire world to affiliate themselves_with eagerness or to remain faithfully attached to this Franciscan institution , which today responds marvelously to the needs of society . That which matters now -isaia- to replace before all eyes the true moral physiognomy of St . Francis of Assisi whom certain moderns present to us , and who springs from the imagination of the Modernists , this man , guarded in his obedience to the Apostolic See , a specimen of a vague and vain religiosity , -isaia- assuredly neither Francis of Assisi nor a saint . The striking and immortal services rendered by Francis to the Christian cause , which_have shown in him the defender whom God in such troubled times reserved for the Church , found , as it were , their coronation in the Third Order . Is there anything which proves more_clearly the greatness and violence of the burning desire which consumed his_soul to spread throughout_the whole earth the glory of Jesus Christ ? . Profoundly saddened by the misfortunes which_the Church was then passing through , Francis conceived the incredible design of renewing everything conformably to the principles of the Christian law . After having founded a double religious family , one of Brothers , the other of Sisters , who pledged themselves by solemn vows to imitate the humility of the Cross , Francis , in the impossibility of opening the cloister to all whom_the desire of being formed in his school drew to him , resolved to procure , even_for souls living in the whirlpool of the world , the means to tend to Christian perfection . He founded , then , an Order properly called Tertiaries , differing from the two other Orders in that it would_not bear the bond of the religious vows , but would be characterized by the same simplicity of life and the same_spirit of penance . Thus the project which no founder of a regular Order had yet imagined , to cause the religious_life to be practised by all , Francis first conceived the idea of and the grace of God gave him to realize it with the greatest success . We have no other proof of it than_this beautiful homage of Thomas de Celano : '' Marvelous workman , whose example , direction , and teachings have this admirable result , to renew in both sexes the Church of Christ and to lead to triumph a triple phalanx of souls preoccupied with_their salvation . We shall confine Ourselves to this testimony of so authoritative a contemporary ; of itself it suffices amply to show to what a depth and to what an extent this initiative of Francis of Assisi shook the popular masses , what notable and salutary reparations it worked therein . Uncontested founder of the Third Order , as he was of the two first , Francis was for it , further , without_doubt , the most wise legislator . We know_that for this_work he had the precious aid of Cardinal Ugolino , who later , under the name of Gregory IX , was to make illustrious this Apostolic See , and who , after_having whilst he lived , maintained the closest relations with the Partiarch of Assisi , elevated later on his tomb a magnificent and sumptuous basilica . As to the rule of the Tertiaries , no one_-isaia- ignorant that_it_was regularly approved by Our predecessor , Nicholas IV . But We shall_not , Venerable Brothers , delay Ourselves too long on these questions ; Our object -isaia- here , before all , to bring to light the character , and , as one says the particular spirit of the third Order , for the Church expects from it special advantages for the Christian people in this age , as hostile to virtue and to faith as was_the epoch of Francis of Assisi . With his profound sense of situations and times Our predecessor , Leo XIII , of happy_memory , desirous to adapt better the regulation of life of the Tertiaries to the social level of each of the faithful , brought , by the Constitution '' Misericors Dei Filius '' to , their statutes or rule most wise motivations which_should put them in accord with the actual state of society ; he modified it in some secondary points responding but imperfectly to our customs of today . '' Let none believe , '' said he , '' that_these changes take away anything whatsoever from the essential principles of that Order . We wish absolutely that_they remain in their integrity , and secure from any branch . '' The rule of the Third Order has then undergone only retouchings of detail ; its range and spirit have_been respected , which remain what their holy founder willed them . Now it -isaia- Our conviction_that the spirit of the Third Order , altogether impregnated with the wisdom of the Gospel , would be a powerful element for the making healthy of private and public orals if it were spread anew as in the times in which by his_word and example Francis preached everywhere the Kingdom of God . What Francis wished to shine out , above all , in his Tertiaries , and which ought to be as their characteristic mark , -isaia- fraternal charity , most watchful guardian of peace and concord . Knowing that charity_-isaia- the special commandment brought by Jesus Christ and the synthesis of the whole Christian law , St . Francis was careful to make of it the spiritual rule of his_children ; and he attained this result , that the Third Order rendered naturally the greatest service to the entire human_family . Further , Francis was powerless to contain in the recesses of his heart_the seraphic love_which consumed him for God and his_brothers ; he was compelled to permit it to overflow on all the souls which he could reach . Thus it was that he set himself to reform the individual and family_life of his_disciples in forming them to the practise of the Christian virtues with_such ardor as would make one believe_that it was all his program . But he did_not dream that he ought to limit himself to this ; individual conversion was but an instrument of which he availed himself to reawaken in the bosom of society love of Christian wisdom , and to gain all men for Christ . The preoccupation which_had moved Francis of Assisi to make of the members of the Third Order messengers and apostles of peace in the midst of the bitter discords and civil wars of his time was ours in the days wherein the conflagration of a horrible war was kindled in almost the entire world ; it has not ceased to be so -atti_degli_apostoli- a moment in which , here and there , the smoking hearth of this ill extinguished conflagration still shoots out flames . To this scourge had_been added the interior crisis which_the nations are going through , first of the forgetfulness and prolonged disdain of Christian principles . We wish to say that_this fight for the sharing of goods which sets in conflict the different classes of society_-isaia- so relentless that it threatens already to lead to a universal catastrophe . In this so vast field , wherein , as representative of the pacific King , We have lavished Our especially attentive cares , We make an appeal for the zealous help of all those_who claim for themselves Christian peace , but especially_for the collaboration of the Tertiaries . They will exert a marvelous influence in restoring concord in spirit the day wherein their number and their_efforts will be developed . It -isaia- , then , desirable that in every city , town , and even in each village , the Third Order count henceforth a sufficient group of members , not of inactive adherents satisfied with the mere title of Tertiaries , but instead , of those_who spend themselves_with zeal for their_own salvation and the salvation of their_brothers . Why even should_not the various Catholic associations which multiply everywhere , associations of youth , of workmen , of women , not affiliate themselves to the Third Order to continue to work_for the glory of Jesus Christ and the triumph of the Church with the same zeal that Francis had for peace and charity ? . The peace for_which humanity cries out -isaia- not that_which the laborious treaty making of human prudence can decree , but that_which Christ brought by its message : '' My peace I bring you ; I do not give it as the world gives it . The accords between State and State or between class and class which men_have been_able to shadow forth will_not be durable , and will_not have_the force of true peace except on condition that_they_are founded on the pacification of hearts ; and that itself_-isaia- only possible if duty has bridled the passions whence all conflicts spring . '' Whence comes , '' asks the Apostle James , '' wars and quarrels amongst you ? Is it not from your passions , which combat in your members ? '' James iv . Now to regulate wisely all the movements inherent to nature in such_a_way as to make man the master , not the slave , of his passions , submissive himself , and docile to the divine will , the hierarchy , which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the base of universal peace , that belongs to Christ , and its action manifests a marvelous efficacy in the family of Franciscan Tertiaries . This Order , having for its object , as We have_said to form its_members in Christian perfection , even whilst they_may be plunged in the embarrassments of the age , so true -isaia- it that no state of life_-isaia- incompatible with sanctity , it happens , as it were , necessarily , where_the Tertiaries in numbers observe faithfully their rule , that_they_are for all about them a source of encouragement in fulfilling their_duties , and even to tending towards a perfection of life superior to the exigencies of the common law . The testimony rendered by the Divine Master to those_who attached themselves closely to Him : '' They are_not of the world , even as I -amos- not of the world '' John xvii : may justly be applied to the sons of Francis who , if they observe the evangelical_counsels of mind_and_heart as far_as_possible in the world , may lawfully put to their account_the words of the Apostle : '' As for us , we have_received not the spirit of this_world , but the Spirit which_comes_from God '' Cor . They will seek , then completely strangers themselves to the spirit of the world to introduce the Spirit of Jesus Christ in the current of social_life on every side to which_they_have access . Now there_are two passions today dominant in the profound lawlessness of morals an unlimited desire of riches and an insatiable thirst_for pleasures . It -isaia- this which marks with a shameful stigma our epoch ; whilst it goes ceaselessly from progress to progress in the order of all which touches the well_being and convenience of life , it seems that in the superior order of honesty and of moral rectitude a lamentable retrogression leads it back to the ignominies of ancient paganism . In that measure , in truth , wherein men lose sight of eternal goods which Heaven reserved for them , they permit themselves to be more taken in by the deceitful mirage of the ephemeral goods here below , and once their_souls are turned down towards_the earth , an easy descent leads them insensibly to relax themselves in virtue , to experience repugnance for spiritual things , and to relish nothing outside the seductions of pleasure . Hence the general situation which we note : with some the desire to acquire riches or to increase their patrimony knows no bounds ; others no longer know , as formerly , how to bear the trials which_are the usual result of want or poverty ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the very hour in which_the rivalries We have pointed_out set by the ears the rich and the proletariat a great number seem to wish to further excite the hatred of the poor by an unbridled luxury which accompanies the most revolting corruption . From this point_of_view one_cannot sufficiently deplore the blindness of so many women of every_age and condition ; made foolish by desire to please , they_do_not see to what a degree the in decency of their clothing shocks every honest man , and offends God . Most of them would formerly have blushed for those toilettes as for a grave fault against Christian modesty ; now it does_not suffice for them to exhibit them on the public thoroughfares ; they_do_not fear to cross the threshold of the churches , to assist -atti_degli_apostoli- the Holy sacrifice of the Mass , and even to bear the seducing food of shameful passions to the Eucharistic Table where one receives the heavenly Author of purity . And We speak not of those exotic and barbarous dances recently imported into fashionable circles , one more shocking than the other ; one_cannot imagine anything more suitable for banishing all the remains of modesty . In considering attentively this state of things , the Tertiaries will understand what it -isaia- that_our epoch expects from the disciples of St . If they bring their gaze back to the life of their Father , they_will see what perfect and living resemblance to Jesus Christ , above all in His flight from satisfactions and his_love of trials in this_life , had he whom_they call the Poverello , and who_had received in his flesh the stigmata of the Crucified . It -isaia- for them to show that_they remain worthy of him by embracing poverty , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in spirit , in renouncing themselves , and in bearing each_one his cross . In what concerns specially the Tertiary Sisters , We ask of them by their dress and manner of wearing it , to be models of holy modesty for other ladies and young girls ; that_they be thoroughly convinced_that the best way_for them to be of use to the Church and to Society -isaia- to labor for the improvement of morals . Moreover , after_having created divers charitable works for the solace of the indigent in their wants of every_kind , the members of this Order would wish , further , We are sure , to cause those of their_brothers who_are deprived of goods more precious than those of earth , to benefit by their charity . Here comes back to Us the memory of the counsel of the Apostle Peter , asking Christians to be , by the holiness of their_lives , models for the Gentiles , and this in order_that , '' remarking your good_works , they glorify God in the day of His visitation '' Peter II . Like them , the Franciscan Tertiaries ought , by the integrity of their_faith , the holiness of their_lives , and the ardor of their zeal , spread abroad the good words of Christ , to warn those of their brethren who_have gone out from the road , and to press them to reenter upon it . Behold that_which the Church asks , that_which she expects from them . As to Us , we cherish the hope_that the coming celebration will mark for the Third Order a new development , and We doubt not_that you yourselves , Venerable Brothers , as well as the other pastors of souls , will_make great efforts to cause to flourish again the groups of tertiaries where_they vegetate , and to create others everywhere possible , and to render all flourishing , as much by the observation of the rule as by the number of their members . In truth what_-isaia- in hand definitely -isaia- , by imitation of Francis of Assisi to open to the greatest possible number of souls the way which_will lead_them back to Christ ; it in this return that resides the firmest hope of salvation for society . Paul , '' Be my imitators , as I myself -amos- of Christ '' I Cor . ; i , we can with_good right put upon the lips of Francis , who , in imitating the Apostle , has become the most faithful image and copy of Jesus Christ . Thus , in order_that these celebrations bear still_more fruit , upon the instances of the Ministers General of the three Franciscan families of the First Order , we accord the following favors drawn_from the treasury of the Holy Church : I . In all Churches wherein the Third Order -isaia- canonically erected , and wherein will be celebrated by a Triduum the solemnities of the Centenary in the year to run from April , next : the Tertiaries each_day of the Triduum , the other Faithful once only , may gain a plenary indulgence from their sins . All the Faithful who , with contrite hearts , will visit the Blessed Sacrament in one of these churches may gain -atti_degli_apostoli- each visit toties quoties an indulgence of seven years . All the altars of these churches will be deemed for those three days privileged altars ; during the course of the Triduum every priest may celebrate there the Mass of St . Francis , following the rite of the Mass pro re gravi et simul publice de causa according to the general rubrics of the Roman Missal inserted in the last Vatican edition . All the priests_who serve these churches may , during these same days , bless beads , medals , and other objects of piety , enrich them_with Apostolic indulgences , and apply to beads the Crozier and Bridgettine indulgences . As pledge of Divine favors , and in testimony of Our paternal benevolence , We accord with all Our heart , to you , Venerable Brothers , and to all the members of the Third Order , the Apostolic Benediction .

Peter s , the Feast of the Epiphany of the year , in the seventh year of Our Pontificate", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Giacomo Della Chiesa", "author_dob": "21/11/1854", "trait": "Domenicano", "author_start": "03/09/1914", "author_end": "22/01/1922", "pontificate_years": 7}
