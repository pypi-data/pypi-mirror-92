Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . It was_the desire of Jesus Christ once He had wrought the Redemption of the human_race by His death on the altar of the Cross , to lead men to obey His commands and thus win eternal_life . To attain this_end He used no other means than the voice of His heralds whose work it was to announce to all mankind what_they had to believe and do in order to be saved . '' It pleased God , by the foolishness of our preaching , to save them that believed . i : He chose therefore His Apostles , and after infusing into their_minds by the power of the Holy Ghost , the gifts in harmony_with their high calling , '' Go ye into_the_world , '' He told them , '' and preach the Gospel . '' Mark xvi , Their preaching renewed the face of the earth . For if the religion of Christ has withdrawn the minds_of_men from errors of every_kind to the truth , and won their_hearts from the degradation of vice to the excellence and beauty of every virtue , assuredly it has done so by means of that_very preaching . '' Faith then cometh by hearing ; and hearing by the word of Christ . x : Wherefore since by God s good pleasure , things_are preserved through the same causes by which_they were brought into being , it -isaia- evident_that the preaching of the wisdom taught us by the Christian religion_-isaia- the means Divinely employed to continue the work of eternal_salvation , and that it must with just reason be looked upon as a matter of the greatest and most momentous concern . That preaching , therefore , must form the object of Our special_care and attention , particularly so , if in any_way , it may_have lost perhaps some of its original perfection or its efficacy may have_been impaired . Here then , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- a burden added to the other misfortunes of these times , with_which , more_than any_one else , We are tried . For if We look around us and count those_who_are engaged in preaching the Word of God , We shall find them more numerous perhaps than they_have ever been before . If on the other_hand We examine the state of public_and_private morals , the constitutions and laws of nations , We shall find that_there_-isaia- a general disregard and forgetfulness of the supernatural , a gradual falling away from the strict standard of Christian virtue , and that_men are slipping back more_and_more into the shameful practices of paganism . The causes of these evils are varied and manifold : no one , however , will gainsay the deplorable fact_that the ministers of the Word do not apply thereto an adequate remedy . Has the Word of God then ceased to be what it was described by the Apostle , living and effectual and more piercing than_any two edged sword ? Has long continued use blunted the edge of that sword ? If that weapon does_not everywhere produce its effect , the blame certainly must be laid on those ministers of the Gospel who_do_not handle it as they_should . For no one_can maintain that the Apostles were living in better times than ours , that_they found minds more readily disposed towards_the Gospel or that_they met with less opposition to the law of God . In view , therefore , of the gravity of the subject , alive to the responsibilities of the apostolic_office and warned by them , animated , moreover , by the example of Our two immediate Predecessors , We realize_that it must be Our earnest endeavor everywhere to bring back the preaching of the Word of God to the norm and ideal to which it must be directed according to the command of Christ Our Lord , and the laws of the Church . In the first_place , Venerable Brethren , We must look for the causes of our deviations from the right path in this_matter . They may be reduced to three : for either the one chosen to preach -isaia- not the right person , or his office -isaia- not performed with the right intention , or in the right way . For the duty of preaching , as the Council of Trent teaches , '' -isaia- the paramount duty of Bishops . iv And the Apostles , whose successors the bishops are , looked upon it as something peculiarly theirs . Paul writes : '' For Christ sent us not to baptize , but to preach the Gospel . i : And the other Apostles were of the opinion that : '' It -isaia- not reason that_we_should leave the Word of God and serve tables . '' Acts vi : But although preaching -isaia- properly the duty of Bishops , nevertheless , since_it_-isaia- impossible that_they_should always or everywhere be able to discharge it in person , distracted as they_are by the many cares which_they meet in the government of their churches , they_must of necessity comply with this obligation through others . Wherefore it cannot be doubted that all those_who in addition to the Bishops are thus engaged , are employed in the performance of an episcopal duty . Let this then be the first law laid_down : that_no_one on his_own responsibility undertake the office of preaching . In order to fulfill that duty everyone must_have a lawful mission , and that mission can be conferred by the Bishop alone . '' How shall they preach , unless they be sent ? '' Rom . x : Now the Apostles were sent and sent by Him who_-isaia- the supreme pastor and Bishop of our souls I Pet . ii : ; so too , were_the seventy two first disciples ; nay , St . Paul himself , although constituted by Christ a vessel of election to carry His name , before Gentiles and kings , Acts ix : entered upon his apostolate only after_the elders in obedience to the command of the Holy Ghost , '' Separate me Saul for the work '' Acts xiii : , had imposed hands upon him and sent him forth . The same practice was constantly followed in the early days of the Church . For all without exception , both those_who distinguished themselves in the priestly order like Origen , and those later on were raised to the dignity of the episcopate , like Cyril of Jerusalem , John Chrysostom , Augustine and the other more ancient Doctors of the Church , undertook the office of preaching with the sanction and authority of their Bishops . But now , Venerable Brethren , the custom seems to be far different . Among our sacred orators , there_are too many to whom might well be applied that complaint which_the Lord makes through the Prophet Jeremias : '' I did_not send prophets , yet they ran . xxiii : For the man_who owing to his peculiar bent of mind , or any_other cause , should choose to undertake the ministry of the Word , finds easy access to the pulpits of our churches as to a drill ground where any_one may practice -atti_degli_apostoli- will . Therefore , Venerable Brethren , it -isaia- your duty to see that_such a grave abuse should disappear , and since you will_have to render to God and to His Church an account of the manner in which_you feed your flock , allow no one to creep unbidden into the sheepfold and to feed the sheep of Christ according_to_his fancy . Therefore let no one henceforth preach in your dioceses except on your summons and with your approval . Here therefore we would_have you pay the greatest heed to whom_you commit so sacred a duty . By the decree of the Council of Trent Bishops are permitted to select for_this office those only who_are '' fit , '' i . those_who '' can exercise the ministry of preaching with profit to souls . '' With profit to souls , '' well note that the word which expresses the rule does_not_mean eloquently or with popular applause , but_with spiritual fruit . This -isaia- the end for_which the ministry of the Divine Word -isaia- instituted . If now you would_have Us define more exactly the qualifications of those_who_are really to be considered fit , We answer : those in whom_you find the signs of a Divine vocation . Whatever -isaia- required_for admission to the priesthood , -isaia- likewise needed if one_-isaia- to be considered eligible and fit for the office of preaching . '' Neither doth any man take this honor to himself , but he that_-isaia- called by God . v : Such a vocation -isaia- easily determined . For Christ Our Lord and Master , when about to ascend into_heaven , did_not by any means bid His Apostles forthwith go into diverse places and begin their preaching : '' But stay you in the city , '' He said , '' till you be indued with power from on high . '' Luke xxiv : This , therefore , -isaia- the sign by which_you may know whether any one_-isaia- Divinely called to this_task : if he '' -isaia- indued '' with power from on high . What this_means , Venerable Brethren , may be gathered from what took_place in the case of the Apostles as soon as they_had received power from on high . For when_the Holy Spirit had descended upon them , not to mention here_the wonderful gifts with which_they were endowed , they_were transformed from frail unlettered disciples into learned and perfect men . If a priest therefore has the required knowledge and virtue together_with those natural qualifications necessary , without_which he would be tempting God , he may be considered as having a true vocation for the office of preaching and there_-isaia- no reason_why he may_not be admitted by the Bishop to this ministry . Such -isaia- the meaning of the Council of Trent when it decrees that the Bishop -isaia- not to permit any to preach unless they_are '' of approved virtue and learning . Wherefore it -isaia-_the_duty of the Bishop long and thoroughly to examine those_who_are to be entrusted by him_with the function of preaching that_he_may find out the nature and extent of their learning . If any_one acts carelessly and negligently in this_duty , he clearly offends in a grievous matter , and on him will fall the responsibility of the errors which_the untrained preacher may spread or of the scandal and the bad example which_the unworthy one may give . To make your task easier in this_matter , Venerable Brethren , We desire_that hereafter severe judgment be passed on these_two points : on the character , namely , and learning of those_who seek to obtain authority to preach , just as -isaia- done on the character and learning of those priests , who_would hear confessions . Whoever , therefore , -isaia- found defective in either regard must without_any consideration whatever be debarred from a function for_which he -isaia- not qualified . Your dignity demands this , since , as We have_said , the preachers are your substitutes . The good of Holy Church demands it , for surely if any one_should be the '' salt of the earth and the light_of_the_world , '' Matt . v : , , it -isaia- the man who_-isaia- engaged in the ministry of the Word . With these rules duly laid_down it may seem superfluous to proceed further and explain what should be the purpose and method of the sacred function of preaching . For if we select our sacred orators in accordance_with_the norm given by Us , they cannot_fail to be endowed_with the requisite virtues , or set before themselves a worthy purpose or follow_the right method in their preaching . Nevertheless it will be serviceable to throw some light on these_two points , that thus_the reason may_become clearer why some fall short of the ideal of a good preacher . The purpose which sacred orators should keep before their mind in performing their_duty may be understood from the fact that_they_may and ought to say of themselves , as did St . Paul '' For Christ therefore we are ambassadors . v : If then they_are ambassadors of Christ they ought to have_the same purpose in discharging their office that Christ had in conferring it on them , nay , the very one_that Christ Himself had while living upon earth . For neither the Apostles , nor the preachers who followed the Apostles had a different mission from Christ s : '' As the Father hath sent me , I also send you . '' John xx : Now we know why Christ descended from heaven , for He says expressly : '' For this came I into_the_world ; that I should give testimony to the truth . '' John xviii : '' I -amos- come that_they_may have life . Both these purposes therefore must be carried_out by the men_who devote_themselves to the sacred_ministry of preaching . They must diffuse the light of truth made_known by God , and in those_who hear them they_must quicken and nourish the supernatural life . In a word , by seeking the salvation_of_souls they_are to promote the glory of God . As it would , therefore , be wrong to call anyone a doctor who_does_not practice medicine , or to style anyone a professor of some art who_does_not teach that art , he who in his preaching neglects to lead men to a fuller knowledge of God and on the way of eternal_salvation may be called an idle declaimer , but_not a preacher of the Gospel . And would there_were no such declaimers ! What motive -isaia- it that sways them mostly . Some are moved by the desire of vain glory and to satisfy it : '' They ponder how they_can express high rather_than practical thoughts , causing weak minds to admire them , instead of working out the salvation of their hearers . They are ashamed of what_-isaia- simple and plain , lest they be thought to know nothing else . They are ashamed to give milk to the little ones . Whereas Jesus Christ proved by the lowliness of his hearers that He was_the One whom men were awaiting : '' The poor have_the Gospel preached to them . xi : What efforts do such men make to acquire reputation by their sermons from the size and wealth of the cities and splendor of the great churches in which_they preach ? But since among the truths revealed by God there_are_some which frighten the weakness of our corrupt nature , and which therefore are_not calculated to attract the multitude , they carefully avoid them , and treat themes , in which , the place accepted , there_-isaia-_nothing sacred . Not seldom it happens_that in the very midst of a discourse upon the things of eternity , they turn to politics , particularly if any questions of this_kind just then deeply engross the minds of their hearers . They seem to have only_one aim , to please their hearers and curry favor with those_whom St . Paul describes as '' having itching ears . vi : Hence that unrestrained and undignified gesture such as may be seen on the stage or on the hustings , that effeminate lowering of the voice or those tragic outbursts ; that diction peculiar to journalism ; those frequent allusions to profane and non Catholic literature , but_not to the Sacred Scriptures or the Holy Fathers ; finally that volubility of utterance often affected by them , wherewith they strike the ears and gain their hearers admiration , but give_them no lesson to carry home . How sadly are_those preachers deceived ! Granted that_they receive the applause of the uneducated , which_they seek with such_great favor , and not_without sacrilege , -isaia- it really worth while when we consider that_they_are condemned by every prudent man , and , what_-isaia- worse , have reason to fear the stern judgment of Christ ? . Not all however who depart from the right rule and norm , Venerable Brethren , are seeking for nothing but popular applause in their preaching . Frequently the preachers who avail themselves of these devices do so to attain some other and even less honorable object . Forgetting the saying of Gregory : '' The priest does_not preach that_he_may eat , but should eat that_he_may preach , '' In I Regum , lib . iii , there_are not_a_few who , because_they think that_they_are unsuited for other labors by which they_might be decently supported , take to preaching , not that_they_may worthily exercise the sacred_ministry , but to make money . We therefore see them devoting all their attention not indeed to finding where greater fruit for souls may be hoped for , but where preaching reaps a more lucrative return . Now since nothing except harm and discredit can be expected for the Church from such as these , Venerable Brethren , you_must exercise the greatest care , so that , if you detect any_one for his_own glory or for gain , abusing the office of preaching , you_should -atti_degli_apostoli- once remove him from that function . For the man who_does_not scruple to defile so holy an office by such an unworthy perversion of its end , surely will not_hesitate to descend to any indignity , and will_bring the stain of ignominy not merely upon himself , but upon the sacred office also which he so unworthily administers . The same severity -isaia- to be shown towards those_who fail to preach properly because_they have neglected the acquisition of whatever_-isaia- necessary_for performing this function becomingly . What these conditions are We may learn from the example of him whom_the Church has called '' the Preacher of truth , '' the Apostle St . Would that by God s mercy We might have many more preachers like him ! . The first lesson , therefore_,_that We learn from St . Paul -isaia- how well prepared and equipped he was for preaching . But We do not refer now to the learned studies he had assiduously pursued under Gamaliel . For the knowledge poured into his_soul by revelation dimmed and nearly eclipsed the knowledge he had acquired by his_own efforts , though that the latter knowledge was of no little value to him -isaia- clear from his Epistles . Learning , as We have_said , -isaia- absolutely necessary_for the preacher , for if he -isaia- without_the light of learning he easily falls into error , since '' Ignorance -isaia- the mother of all errors , '' as the Fourth Lateran Council so truthfully observes . We would_not be understood , however , to mean every sort of knowledge , but_only that_which it becomes a priest to possess , that_-isaia- to say , the knowledge , to phrase it briefly , which consists of a knowledge of self , of God and his duties . For self knowledge , We maintain , will_lead a priest to renounce his_own advantage . The knowledge of God will_lead him to make everyone else know and love God , and the knowledge of his office will_lead him to discharge his_own duties and to teach others to do theirs . If he lacks these three kinds of knowledge , whatever other learning he has , will only puff him up , and will be useless . Let us now consider what_the Apostle s spiritual preparation_for preaching was . The three qualities of his equipment most worthy of note are these : First of all he was a man_who always fully conformed himself to God s will . No sooner was he smitten , when on the road to Damascus , by the power of the Lord Jesus than he uttered that cry so worthy of an apostle : '' Lord what will thou have me to do ? '' Acts ix : For then and there as ever afterwards , for Christ s sake he was indifferent to toil or rest , to poverty or wealth , to praise or contempt , to life or death . There can be no doubt_that he made such progress in the apostolate because he conformed with_such perfect submission to the will of God . Paul , every preacher devoted to the salvation_of_souls should be first of all so zealous for God s service as to feel no concern about who his hearers are to be , what success he will_have , or what fruits he -isaia- to reap . He should_have an eye not to his_own advantage but to God s glory . But such zeal for God s service as that demands a soul so prepared_for hardships that it will_not avoid labor or trouble of any_kind , and that_-isaia- the second quality that_was conspicuous in St . For when_the Lord had said to him : '' I will show him how_great things he must suffer for my name s sake , '' Acts ix : he so eagerly embraced suffering that he could write : '' I exceedingly abound with_joy in all our tribulations . vii : Indeed if this patient endurance of hardships -isaia- conspicuous in a preacher , it effaces whatever human weakness there_-isaia- in him and wins from God the grace to produce fruit and gains for his apostolate , to a degree beyond belief , the favor of Christian people . On the other_hand but little success in moving hearts -isaia- attained by those_who , wherever they go , immoderately desire the comforts of life , and provided they deliver their sermons , put their hand to scarcely any_other work of the sacred_ministry , and the result -isaia- that_they appear to be seeking their_own ease rather_than the good of souls . In the third place the '' spirit of prayer , '' as it -isaia- called , -isaia- necessary , the Apostle tells us , for the preacher . No sooner was he himself called to the apostolate than he began his supplications to God . '' For behold he prayeth . '' Acts ix : For it -isaia- not by pouring forth a copious stream of words , not by using subtle arguments , not by delivering violent harangues , that the salvation_of_souls -isaia- effected . The preacher who_-isaia- content with_those means -isaia- nothing but '' sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal . xiii : What gives a man s words life and vigor and makes them promote wonderfully the salvation_of_souls -isaia- Divine grace : '' God gave the increase . iii : But the grace of God -isaia- not gained by study and practice : it -isaia- won by prayer . Therefore he who_-isaia- little given to prayer or neglects it altogether , vainly spends his time and labor in preaching , for in God s sight his sermons profit neither himself nor those_who hear him . To express briefly , therefore , what We have just said , let Us quote these_words of St . Peter Damian : '' For the preacher two things_are especially necessary : namely that his_words should be rich in ghostly wisdom , and that his_life should be conspicuous for the luster of its piety . But if a priest_-isaia- unequal to being both holy in life and rich in learning , holiness of life_-isaia- , without question , to be preferred to mere learning . For the example of a saintly life_-isaia- more powerful than eloquence and a studied delivery . The priest who discharges the office of preaching should cause showers of heavenly wisdom to fall from his lips , and from his_life rays of piety to shine out , just as the angel in telling the shepherds of Our Lord s birth , both shone with_great splendor and expressed in words the tidings he had come to announce . i ad Cinthium Urbis Praef . Paul , if we ask on what subjects he was wont to discourse when he preached , he condenses them all in these_words : '' For I judged not myself to know anything among_you but Jesus Christ and Him crucified . ii : To make men know Jesus Christ better and better , and to make that knowledge have a bearing , moreover , not_only on their_faith , but on their_lives as well , was_the object of that apostolic man s every endeavor . This was_the object of every throb of his_apostolic heart . Therefore all Christ s doctrines and commands , even the sterner ones , were so proclaimed by St . Paul that he did_not restrict , gloss over or tone down what Christ taught regarding humility , self denial , chastity , contempt of the world , obedience , forgiveness of enemies , and the like , nor was he afraid to tell his hearers that_they had to make a choice between_the service of God and the service of Belial , for they could_not serve both , that_when they leave this_world , a dread judgment awaits them ; that they_cannot bargain with God ; they_may hope_for life everlasting if they keep His entire law , but if they neglect their_duty and indulge their passions , they_will have nothing to expect but eternal fire . For our '' Preacher of truth '' never imagined that he should avoid such subjects , because , owing to the corruption of the age , they appeared too stern to his hearers . Therefore it -isaia- clear how unworthy of commendation are_those preachers who_are afraid to touch upon certain points of Christian doctrine lest they_should give their hearers offense . Does a physician prescribe useless remedies to his patient , merely because the sick man rejects effective ones ? The test of the orator s power and skill -isaia-_his success in making his hearers accept the stern truth he -isaia- preaching . How did the Apostle unfold the subjects of which he treated ? '' Not in the persuasive words of human wisdom . ii : It -isaia- perfectly plain , Venerable Brethren , how important_for everybody it -isaia- that_they_should thoroughly realize this , since we see_that not_a_few of our sacred preachers overlook in their sermons the Sacred Scriptures , the Fathers and Doctors of the Church , '' and the arguments based on sacred theology , and for the most part , make_their appeals only to reason . Unquestionably that_-isaia- wrong , for in the supernatural order , merely human resources are of no help whatever . But the objection may be urged : The people_have no confidence in the preacher who insists on Divinely revealed truths . Is that true ? With non Catholics , granted . However , when_the Greeks sought the Wisdom , forsooth , of this_world , the Apostle , nevertheless , preached to them Christ crucified . If we direct our attention , however , to Catholic people , even_those men among_them who_are unfriendly to us , generally keep in their_hearts the roots of faith . Their intellects are blinded because their_souls are corrupted . Lastly , what end did St . Paul have in his preaching ? Not to please men , but Christ . '' If I yet pleased men , I should_not be the servant of Christ . i : As his_heart was on fire with the love of Christ , he sought for nothing save the glory of Christ . O that all are engaged in the ministry of the Word were true lovers of Jesus Christ . Would that all could repeat these_words of St . Paul : '' For whom Jesus Christ I have suffered the loss of all things , '' Phil . iii : and '' To me to live -isaia- Christ . i : Only those_who glow with love themselves know_how to set on fire the hearts of others . Bernard gave a preacher this counsel : '' If you_are wise , be a reservoir , not a conduit , be full yourself of what_you preach and do not think it enough to pour it out for others . The Doctor then adds : '' Today we have in the Church a profusion of conduits , but how few are the reservoirs ! '' . We must strive with_all_our might and main , Venerable Brethren , to prevent such a state of things from occurring in the future . For it -isaia- your duty , by rejecting the unfit and by encouraging , training and guiding the fit , to bring it to pass that there_should now be no lack of preachers who_are men after God s own heart . Through the intercession , therefore , of the most Holy Virgin , the August Mother of the Incarnate Word Himself , and the Queen of the Apostles , may Jesus Christ the merciful and everlasting Shepherd of souls vouchsafe to look down with favor on His flock , fill the clergy with the apostolic spirit , and grant that_there may be many who_will strive eagerly '' to present themselves approved unto God workmen that needeth not to be ashamed , rightly handling the word of truth . As a pledge of heavenly favors and in testimony of Our good_will , we lovingly impart the Apostolic Benediction to you , Venerable Brethren , and to your clergy_and_people .
