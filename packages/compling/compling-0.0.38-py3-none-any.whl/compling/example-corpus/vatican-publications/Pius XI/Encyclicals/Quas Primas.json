Venerable Brethren , Greeting and the Apostolic Benediction . In the first Encyclical Letter which We addressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Our Pontificate to the Bishops of the universal Church , We referred to the chief causes of the difficulties under which mankind was laboring . And We remember saying that_these manifold evils in the world were due to the fact_that the majority of men had thrust Jesus Christ and his holy law out of their_lives ; that_these had no place either in private affairs or in politics : and we said further , that as long as individuals and states refused to submit to the rule of our Savior , there_would be no really hopeful prospect of a lasting peace among nations . Men must look for the peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ ; and that We promised to do as far as lay in Our power . In the Kingdom of Christ , that_-isaia- , it seemed to Us that peace could_not be more effectually restored nor fixed upon a firmer basis than through the restoration of the Empire of Our Lord . We were led in the meantime to indulge the hope of a brighter future -atti_degli_apostoli- the sight of a more widespread and keener interest evinced in Christ and his Church , the one Source of Salvation , a sign that_men who_had formerly spurned the rule of our Redeemer and had exiled themselves from his_kingdom were preparing , and even hastening , to return to the duty of obedience . The many notable and memorable events which_have occurred during_this Holy Year have_given great honor and glory to Our Lord and King , the Founder of the Church . At the Missionary Exhibition men have_been deeply impressed in seeing the increasing zeal of the Church for the spread of the kingdom of her Spouse to the most far distant regions of the earth . They have_seen how_many countries have_been won to the Catholic name through the unremitting labor and self sacrifice of missionaries , and the vastness of the regions which_have yet to be subjected to the sweet and saving yoke of our King . All those_who in the course of the Holy Year have thronged to this city under the leadership of their Bishops or priests had but_one aim namely , to expiate their sins and -atti_degli_apostoli- the tombs of the Apostles and in Our Presence to promise loyalty to the rule of Christ . A still further light of glory was shed upon his_kingdom , when after due proof of their heroic virtue , We raised to the honors of the altar six confessors and virgins . It was a great joy , a great consolation , that filled Our heart when in the majestic basilica of St . Peter Our decree was acclaimed by an immense multitude with the hymn of thanksgiving , Tu Rex gloriae Christe . We saw men and nations cut off from God , stirring up strife and discord and hurrying along the road to ruin and death , while the Church of God carries on her work of providing food for the spiritual_life of men , nurturing and fostering generation after generation of men_and_women dedicated to Christ , faithful and subject to him in his earthly kingdom , called by him to eternal bliss in the kingdom_of_heaven . Moreover , since_this jubilee Year marks the sixteenth centenary of the Council of Nicaea , We commanded that event to be celebrated , and We have_done so in the Vatican basilica . There -isaia- a special reason_for this in that the Nicene Synod defined and proposed for Catholic belief the dogma of the Consubstantiality of the Onlybegotten with the Father , and added to the Creed the words '' of whose kingdom there shall be no end , '' thereby affirming the kingly dignity of Christ . Since this Holy Year therefore has provided more_than one opportunity to enhance the glory of the kingdom of Christ , we deem it in keeping_with our Apostolic office to accede to the desire of many of the Cardinals , Bishops , and faithful , made_known to Us both individually and collectively , by closing this Holy Year with the insertion into the Sacred Liturgy of a special feast of the Kingship of Our Lord Jesus Christ . This matter -isaia- so dear to Our heart , Venerable Brethren , that I would wish to address to you a few words concerning it . It will be for you later to explain in a manner suited to the understanding of the faithful what We are about to say concerning the Kingship of Christ , so that the annual feast which We shall decree may be attended with much fruit and produce beneficial results in the future . It has long been a common custom to give to Christ the metaphorical title of '' King , '' because of the high degree of perfection whereby he excels all creatures . So he -isaia- said to reign '' in the hearts of men , '' both by reason of the keenness of his intellect and the extent of his knowledge , and also_because he -isaia-_very truth , and it -isaia- from him that_truth must be obediently received by all mankind . He reigns , too , in the wills of men , for in him the human will was perfectly and entirely obedient to the Holy Will of God , and further by his_grace and inspiration he so subjects our free will as to incite us to the most noble endeavors . He -isaia- King of hearts , too , by reason of his '' charity_which exceedeth all knowledge . '' And his_mercy and kindness which draw all men to him , for never has it been known , nor will it ever be , that_man be loved so much and so universally as Jesus Christ . But if we ponder this_matter more_deeply , we cannot_but see_that the title and the power of King belongs to Christ as man in the strict and proper sense too . For it -isaia- only as man that_he_may be said to have received_from_the Father '' power and glory and a kingdom , '' since_the Word of God , as consubstantial with the Father , has all things in common with_him , and therefore has necessarily supreme and absolute dominion over all things created . Do we not read throughout_the Scriptures that Christ -isaia- the King ? He it -isaia- that shall come out of Jacob to rule , who has_been set by the Father as king over Sion , his holy mount , and shall_have the Gentiles for his inheritance , and the utmost parts of the earth for his possession . In the nuptial hymn , where_the future King of Israel -isaia- hailed as a most rich and powerful monarch , we read : '' Thy throne , O God , -isaia- for ever and ever ; the scepter of thy kingdom -isaia- a scepter of righteousness . '' There are_many similar passages , but there_-isaia-_one in which Christ -isaia- even more_clearly indicated . Here it -isaia- foretold that his_kingdom will_have no limits , and will be enriched with justice_and_peace : '' in his days shall justice spring up , and abundance of peace . And he shall rule from sea to sea , and from the river unto the ends of the earth . The testimony of the Prophets -isaia- even_more abundant . That of Isaias -isaia- well_known : '' For a child -isaia- born to us and a son -isaia- given to us , and the government -isaia- upon his shoulder , and his_name shall be called Wonderful , Counselor , God the mighty , the Father of the world to come , the Prince of Peace . His empire shall be multiplied , and there shall be no end of peace . He shall sit upon the throne of David and upon his_kingdom ; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice , from henceforth and for ever . '' With Isaias the other Prophets are in agreement . So Jeremias foretells the '' just seed '' that shall rest from the house of David the Son of David that shall reign as king , '' and shall be wise , and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth . '' So , too , Daniel , who announces the kingdom that the God of heaven shall found , '' that shall never be destroyed , and shall stand for ever . '' And again he says : '' I beheld , therefore , in the vision of the night , and , lo ! one like the son_of_man came with the clouds of heaven . And he came even to the Ancient of days : and they presented him before him . And he gave him power and glory and a kingdom : and all peoples , tribes , and tongues shall serve him . His power -isaia- an everlasting power that shall_not be taken away , and his_kingdom shall_not be destroyed . '' The prophecy of Zachary concerning the merciful King '' riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass '' entering Jerusalem as '' the just and savior , '' amid the acclamations of the multitude , was recognized as fulfilled by the holy evangelists themselves . This same doctrine of the Kingship of Christ which_we_have found in the Old Testament -isaia- even more_clearly taught and confirmed in the New . The Archangel , announcing to the Virgin that_she should bear a Son , says_that '' the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his_father , and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever ; and of his_kingdom there shall be no end . Moreover , Christ himself speaks of his_own kingly authority : in his last discourse , speaking of the rewards and punishments that_will be the eternal lot of the just and the damned ; in his reply to the Roman magistrate , who asked him publicly whether he were a king or not ; after his_resurrection , when giving to his Apostles the mission of teaching and baptizing all nations , he took the opportunity to call himself king , confirming the title publicly , and solemnly proclaimed that all power was_given him in heaven and on earth . These words can_only be taken to indicate the greatness of his_power , the infinite extent of his_kingdom . What wonder , then_,_that he whom St . John calls the '' prince of the kings of the earth '' appears in the Apostle s vision of the future as he who '' hath on his garment and on his thigh written King of kings and Lord of lords ! . '' It -isaia- Christ whom_the Father '' hath appointed heir of all things '' ; '' for he must reign until -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the world he hath put all his enemies under the feet of God and the Father . It was surely right , then , in view of the common teaching of the sacred_books , that the Catholic Church , which_-isaia- the kingdom of Christ on earth , destined to be spread among all men and all nations , should with every token of veneration salute her Author and Founder in her annual liturgy as King and Lord , and as King of Kings . And , in fact , she used these titles , giving expression with wonderful variety of language to one_and_the_same concept , both in ancient psalmody and in the Sacramentaries . She uses them daily now in the prayers publicly offered to God , and in offering the Immaculate Victim . The perfect harmony of the Eastern liturgies with_our own in this continual praise of Christ the King shows once_more the truth of the axiom : Legem credendi lex statuit supplicandi . The rule of faith_-isaia- indicated by the law of our worship . The foundation of this_power and dignity of Our Lord -isaia- rightly indicated by Cyril of Alexandria . '' Christ , '' he says , '' has dominion over all creatures , a dominion not seized by violence nor usurped , but his by essence and by nature . '' His kingship -isaia- founded upon the ineffable hypostatic union . From this it follows not_only that Christ -isaia- to be adored by angels and men , but_that to him as man angels and men_are subject , and must recognize his empire ; by reason of the hypostatic union Christ has power over all creatures . But a thought that_must give us even greater joy and consolation -isaia- this_that Christ -isaia-_our King by acquired , as well as by natural right , for he -isaia-_our Redeemer . Would that_they who forget what they_have cost their Savior might recall_the words : '' You were_not redeemed with corruptible things , but_with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled . '' We are no longer our_own property , for Christ has purchased us '' with a great price '' ; our very bodies are the '' members of Christ . Let Us explain briefly the nature and meaning of this lordship of Christ . It consists , We need scarcely say , in a threefold power which_-isaia- essential to lordship . This -isaia- sufficiently clear from the scriptural testimony already adduced concerning the universal dominion of our Redeemer , and moreover it -isaia- a dogma of faith_that Jesus Christ was_given to man , not_only as our Redeemer , but_also as a law giver , to whom obedience -isaia- due . Not only do the gospels tell us that he made laws , but_they present him to us in the act of making them . Those who keep them show their love for their Divine Master , and he promises that they_shall remain in his_love . He claimed judicial power as received_from his Father , when_the Jews accused him of breaking the Sabbath by the miraculous cure of a sick man . '' For neither doth the Father judge any man ; but hath given all judgment to the Son . '' In this_power -isaia- included the right of rewarding and punishing all men living , for_this right -isaia- inseparable from that of judging . Executive power , too , belongs to Christ , for all must obey his commands ; none may escape them , nor the sanctions he has imposed . This kingdom -isaia- spiritual and -isaia- concerned_with spiritual things . That this_-isaia- so the above quotations from Scripture amply prove , and Christ by his_own action confirms it . On many occasions , when_the Jews and even the Apostles wrongly supposed that the Messiah would restore the liberties and the kingdom of Israel , he repelled and denied such a suggestion . When the populace thronged around him in admiration and would_have acclaimed him King , he shrank from the honor and sought safety in flight . Before the Roman magistrate he declared that his_kingdom was_not of this_world . The gospels present this kingdom as one_which men prepare to enter by penance , and cannot actually enter except by faith and by baptism , which , though an external rite , signifies and produces an interior regeneration . This kingdom -isaia- opposed to none other_than to that of Satan and to the power of darkness . It demands of its subjects a spirit of detachment from riches and earthly things , and a spirit of gentleness . They must hunger and thirst after justice , and more_than this , they_must deny themselves and carry the cross . Christ as our Redeemer purchased the Church -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of his_own blood ; as priest he offered himself , and continues to offer himself as a victim for our sins . Is it not evident , then_,_that his kingly dignity partakes in a manner of both these offices ? . It would be a grave error , on the other_hand , to say that Christ has no authority whatever in civil affairs , since , by virtue of the absolute empire over all creatures committed to him by the Father , all things_are in his_power . Nevertheless , during his_life on earth he refrained from the exercise of such authority , and although he himself disdained to possess or to care_for earthly goods , he did_not , nor_does he today , interfere with_those_who possess them . Non eripit mortalia qui regna dat caelestia . Thus the empire of our Redeemer embraces all men . To use the words of Our immortal predecessor , Pope Leo XIII : '' His empire includes not_only Catholic nations , not_only baptized persons_who , though of right belonging to the Church , have_been led astray by error , or have_been cut off from her by schism , but_also all those_who_are outside the Christian faith ; so that truly the whole of mankind -isaia- subject to the power of Jesus Christ . '' Nor -isaia- there any difference in this_matter between_the individual and the family or the State ; for all men , whether collectively or individually , are under the dominion of Christ . In him -isaia- the salvation of the individual , in him -isaia- the salvation of society . '' Neither -isaia- there salvation in any_other , for there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved . '' He -isaia- the author of happiness and true prosperity for_every man and for_every nation . '' For a nation -isaia- happy when its citizens are happy . What else -isaia- a nation but a number of men living in concord ? '' If , therefore , the rulers of nations wish to preserve their authority , to promote and increase the prosperity of their countries , they_will not neglect the public duty of reverence and obedience to the rule of Christ . What We said -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Our Pontificate concerning the decline of public_authority , and the lack of respect_for the same , -isaia- equally true -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day . '' With God and Jesus Christ , '' we said , '' excluded from political_life , with authority derived not from God but_from man , the very basis of that authority has_been taken away , because the chief reason of the distinction between ruler and subject has_been eliminated . The result -isaia- that_human society_-isaia- tottering to its fall , because it has no longer a secure and solid foundation . When once men recognize , both in private and in public_life , that Christ -isaia- King , society will -atti_degli_apostoli- last receive the great blessings of real liberty , well ordered discipline , peace and harmony . Our Lord s regal office invests the human authority of princes and rulers with a religious significance ; it ennobles the citizen s duty of obedience . It -isaia- for_this reason_that St . Paul , while bidding wives revere Christ in their husbands , and slaves respect Christ in their masters , warns them to give obedience to them_not as men , but as the vicegerents of Christ ; for it -isaia- not meet that_men redeemed by Christ should serve their fellow men . '' You are bought with a price ; be not made the bond slaves of men . '' If princes and magistrates duly elected are filled_with_the persuasion that_they rule , not by their_own right , but by the mandate and in the place of the Divine King , they_will exercise their authority piously and wisely , and they_will make laws and administer them , having in view the common_good and also the human_dignity of their subjects . The result will be a stable peace and tranquillity , for there_will be no longer any cause of discontent . Men will see in their king or in their rulers men like themselves , perhaps unworthy or open to criticism , but they_will not on that account refuse obedience if they see reflected in them the authority of Christ God and Man . Peace and harmony , too , will result ; for with the spread and the universal extent of the kingdom of Christ men will_become more_and_more conscious of the link that binds them together , and thus many conflicts will be either prevented entirely or -atti_degli_apostoli- least their bitterness will be diminished . If the kingdom of Christ , then , receives , as it should , all nations under its way , there seems no reason_why we should despair of seeing that peace which_the King of Peace came to bring on earth he who came to reconcile all things , who came not to be ministered unto but to minister , who , though Lord of all , gave himself to us as a model of humility , and with_his principal law united the precept of charity ; who said also : '' My yoke -isaia- sweet and my burden light . '' Oh , what happiness would be Ours if all men , individuals , families , and nations , would but let themselves be governed by Christ ! '' Then -atti_degli_apostoli- length , '' to use the words addressed by our predecessor , Pope Leo XIII , twenty five years_ago to the bishops of the Universal Church , '' then -atti_degli_apostoli- length will many evils be cured ; then will the law regain its former authority ; peace with all its blessings be restored . Men will sheathe their swords and lay_down their arms when all freely acknowledge and obey the authority of Christ , and every tongue confesses that the Lord Jesus Christ -isaia- in the glory of God the Father . That these blessings may be abundant and lasting in Christian society , it -isaia- necessary_that the kingship of our Savior should be as widely as possible recognized and understood , and to the end nothing would serve better_than the institution of a special feast in honor of the Kingship of Christ . For people_are instructed in the truths of faith , and brought to appreciate the inner joys of religion far more effectually by the annual celebration of our sacred mysteries than by any official pronouncement of the teaching of the Church . Such pronouncements usually reach only a few and the more learned among the faithful ; feasts reach them all ; the former speak but once , the latter speak every year in fact , forever . The church_s_teaching affects the mind primarily ; her feasts affect both mind_and_heart , and have a salutary effect upon the whole of man s nature . Man -isaia- composed of body_and_soul , and he needs these external festivities so that the sacred rites , in all their beauty and variety , may stimulate him to drink more_deeply of the fountain of God s teaching , that_he_may make it a part of himself , and use it with profit for his spiritual_life . History , in fact , tells us that in the course of ages these festivals have_been instituted one after another according as the needs or the advantage of the people of Christ seemed to demand : as when_they needed strength to face a common danger , when they_were attacked by insidious heresies , when_they needed to be urged to the pious consideration of some mystery of faith or of some divine blessing . Thus in the earliest days of the Christian era , when_the people of Christ were suffering cruel persecution , the cult of the martyrs was begun in order , says St . Augustine , '' that the feasts of the martyrs might incite men to martyrdom . '' The liturgical honors paid to confessors , virgins and widows produced wonderful results in an increased zest for virtue , necessary even in times of peace . But more fruitful still were_the feasts instituted in honor of the Blessed Virgin . As a result of these_men grew not_only in their devotion to the Mother of God as an ever present advocate , but_also in their love of her as a mother bequeathed to them by their Redeemer . Not least among the blessings which_have resulted from the public and legitimate honor paid to the Blessed Virgin and the saints -isaia- the perfect and perpetual immunity of the Church from error and heresy . We may well admire in this_the admirable wisdom of the Providence of God , who , ever bringing good out of evil , has from time to time suffered the faith and piety of men to grow weak , and allowed Catholic truth to be attacked by false doctrines , but always with the result that_truth has afterwards shone out with_greater splendor , and that_men s faith , aroused from its lethargy , has shown itself more vigorous than before . The festivals that have_been introduced into the liturgy in more recent_years have_had a similar origin , and have_been attended with similar results . When reverence and devotion to the Blessed Sacrament had grown cold , the feast of Corpus Christi was instituted , so that by means of solemn processions and prayer of eight days duration , men might be brought once_more to render public homage to Christ . So , too , the feast of the Sacred Heart of Jesus was instituted -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when men were oppressed by the sad and gloomy severity of Jansenism , which_had made their_hearts grow cold , and shut them out from the love of God and the hope of salvation . If We ordain that_the_whole Catholic world shall revere Christ as King , We shall minister to the need of the present_day , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time provide an excellent remedy for the plague which now infects society . We refer to the plague of anti clericalism , its errors and impious activities . This evil spirit , as you_are well_aware , Venerable Brethren , has not come into being in one_day ; it has long lurked beneath the surface . The empire of Christ over all nations was rejected . The right which_the Church has from Christ himself , to teach mankind , to make laws , to govern peoples in all that pertains to their eternal_salvation , that right was denied . Then gradually the religion of Christ came to be likened to false religions and to be placed ignominiously on the same level with_them . It was then put under the power of the state and tolerated more_or_less -atti_degli_apostoli- the whim of princes and rulers . Some men went even further , and wished to set up in the place of God s religion a natural religion consisting in some instinctive affection of the heart . There were even some nations who thought they could dispense with God , and that_their religion should consist in impiety and the neglect of God . The rebellion of individuals and states against the authority of Christ has produced deplorable consequences . We lamented these in the Encyclical Ubi arcano ; we lament them today : the seeds of discord sown far and wide ; those bitter enmities and rivalries between nations , which still hinder so much the cause of peace ; that insatiable greed which_-isaia- so often hidden under a pretense of public spirit and patriotism , and gives_rise to so many private quarrels ; a blind and immoderate selfishness , making men seek nothing but their_own comfort and advantage , and measure everything by these ; no peace in the home , because men_have forgotten or neglect their_duty ; the unity and stability of the family undermined ; society in a word , shaken to its foundations and on the way to ruin . We firmly hope , however_,_that the feast of the Kingship of Christ , which in future will be yearly observed , may hasten the return of society to our loving Savior . It would be the duty of Catholics to do all they_can to bring_about this happy result . Many of these , however , have neither the station in society nor the authority which_should belong to those_who bear the torch of truth . This state of things may perhaps be attributed to a certain slowness and timidity in good people , who_are reluctant to engage in conflict or oppose but a weak resistance ; thus_the enemies of the Church become bolder in their attacks . But if the faithful were generally to understand_that it behooves them ever to fight courageously under the banner of Christ their King , then , fired with apostolic zeal , they_would strive to win over to their Lord those hearts that_are bitter and estranged from him , and would valiantly defend his rights . Moreover , the annual and universal celebration of the feast of the Kingship of Christ will draw attention to the evils which anticlericalism has brought upon society in drawing men away from Christ , and will_also do much to remedy them . While nations insult the beloved name of our Redeemer by suppressing all mention of it in their conferences and parliaments , we must all the more loudly proclaim his kingly dignity and power , all the more universally affirm his rights . The way has_been happily and providentially prepared_for the celebration of this feast ever since_the end of the last century . It -isaia- well_known that_this cult has been_the subject of learned disquisitions in many books published in every part_of_the_world , written in many_different languages . The kingship and empire of Christ have_been recognized in the pious custom , practiced by many families , of dedicating themselves to the Sacred Heart of Jesus ; not_only families have performed this act of dedication , but nations , too , and kingdoms . In fact , the whole of the human_race was -atti_degli_apostoli- the instance of Pope Leo XIII , in the Holy Year , consecrated to the Divine Heart . It should be remarked also_that much has_been done for the recognition of Christ s authority over society by the frequent Eucharistic Congresses which_are held in our_age . These give an opportunity to the people of each diocese , district or nation , and to the whole_world of coming together to venerate and adore Christ the King hidden under the Sacramental species . Thus by sermons preached -atti_degli_apostoli- meetings and in churches , by public adoration of the Blessed Sacrament exposed and by solemn processions , men unite in paying homage to Christ , whom God has_given them_for their King . It -isaia- by a divine inspiration that the people of Christ bring forth Jesus from his silent hiding place in the church , and carry him in triumph through the streets of the city , so that he whom men refused to receive when he came unto his_own , may now receive in full his kingly rights . For the fulfillment of the plan of which We have spoken , the Holy Year , which_-isaia- now speeding to its close , offers the best possible opportunity . For during_this year the God of mercy has raised the minds and hearts of the faithful to the consideration of heavenly blessings which_are above all understanding , has either restored them once_more to his_grace , or inciting them anew to strive for higher gifts , has set their feet more firmly in the path of righteousness . Whether , therefore , We consider_the many prayers that have_been addressed to Us , or look to the events of the Jubilee Year , just past , We have every reason to think_that the desired moment has -atti_degli_apostoli- length arrived for enjoining that Christ be venerated by a special feast as King of all mankind . In this_year , as We said -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this Letter , the Divine King , truly wonderful in all his works , has_been gloriously magnified , for another company of his soldiers has_been added to the list of saints . In this_year men_have looked upon strange things and strange labors , from which_they_have understood and admired the victories won by missionaries in the work of spreading his_kingdom . In this_year , by solemnly celebrating the centenary of the Council of Nicaea . We have commemorated the definition of the divinity of the word Incarnate , the foundation of Christ s empire over all men . Therefore by Our Apostolic Authority We institute the Feast of the Kingship of Our Lord Jesus Christ to be observed yearly throughout_the whole_world on the last Sunday of the month of October the Sunday , that_-isaia- , which immediately precedes the Feast of All Saints . We further ordain that the dedication of mankind to the Sacred Heart of Jesus , which Our predecessor of saintly memory , Pope Pius X , commanded to be renewed yearly , be made annually on that day . This year , however , We desire_that it be observed on the thirty first day of the month on which day We Ourselves shall celebrate pontifically in honor of the kingship of Christ , and shall command that the same dedication be performed in Our presence . It seems to Us that We cannot in a more fitting manner close this Holy Year , nor better signify Our gratitude and that of the whole of the Catholic world to Christ the immortal King of ages , for the blessings showered upon Us , upon the Church , and upon the Catholic world during_this holy period . It -isaia- not necessary , Venerable Brethren , that We should explain to you -atti_degli_apostoli- any length why We have decreed that_this feast of the Kingship of Christ should be observed in addition to those other feasts in which his kingly dignity -isaia-_already signified and celebrated . It will suffice to remark that although in all the feasts of our Lord the material object of worship -isaia- Christ , nevertheless their formal object -isaia- something quite distinct from his royal title and dignity . We have commanded its observance on a Sunday in order_that not_only the clergy may perform their_duty by saying Mass and reciting the Office , but_that the laity too , free_from their_daily tasks , may in a spirit of holy joy give ample testimony of their obedience and subjection to Christ . The last Sunday of October seemed the most convenient of all for this_purpose , because_it_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the liturgical year , and thus_the feast of the Kingship of Christ sets the crowning glory upon the mysteries of the life of Christ already commemorated during the year , and , before celebrating the triumph of all the Saints , we proclaim and extol the glory of him_who triumphs in all the Saints and in all the Elect . Make it your duty and your task , Venerable Brethren , to see_that sermons are preached to the people in every parish to teach them the meaning and the importance of this feast , that_they_may so order their_lives as to be worthy of faithful and obedient subjects of the Divine King . We would now , Venerable Brethren , in closing this_letter , briefly enumerate the blessings which We hope and pray may accrue to the Church , to society , and to each_one of the faithful , as a result of the public veneration of the Kingship of Christ . When we pay honor to the princely dignity of Christ , men will doubtless be reminded that the Church , founded by Christ as a perfect society , has a natural and inalienable right to perfect freedom and immunity from the power of the state ; and that in fulfilling the task committed to her by God of teaching , ruling , and guiding to eternal bliss those_who belong to the kingdom of Christ , she cannot be subject to any external power . The State -isaia- bound to extend similar freedom to the orders and communities of religious of either sex , who give most valuable help to the Bishops of the Church by laboring for the extension and the establishment of the kingdom of Christ . By their sacred vows they fight against the threefold concupiscence of the world ; by making profession of a more_perfect life they render the holiness which her_divine Founder willed should be a mark and characteristic of his Church more striking and more conspicuous in the eyes of all . Nations will be reminded by the annual celebration of this feast that not_only private individuals but_also rulers and princes are_bound to give public honor and obedience to Christ . It will call to their_minds the thought of the last judgment , wherein Christ , who has_been cast out of public_life , despised , neglected and ignored , will most severely avenge these insults ; for his kingly dignity demands_that the State should_take account of the commandments of God and of Christian principles , both in making laws and in administering justice , and also in providing for the young a sound moral education . The faithful , moreover , by meditating upon these truths , will gain much strength and courage , enabling them to form their_lives after_the true Christian ideal . If to Christ our Lord -isaia- given all power in heaven and on earth ; if all men , purchased by his precious blood , are by a new right subjected to his dominion ; if this_power embraces all men , it must be clear_that not one of our faculties -isaia- exempt from his empire . He must reign in our minds , which_should assent with perfect submission and firm belief to revealed truths and to the doctrines of Christ . He must reign in our wills , which_should obey the laws and precepts of God . He must reign in our_hearts , which_should spurn natural desires and love God above all things , and cleave to him alone . He must reign in our bodies and in our members , which_should serve as instruments for the interior sanctification of our souls , or to use the words of the Apostle Paul , as instruments of justice unto God . If all these truths are presented to the faithful for their consideration , they_will prove a powerful incentive to perfection . It -isaia- Our fervent desire , Venerable Brethren , that_those_who are without_the fold may seek after and accept the sweet yoke of Christ , and that we , who by the mercy of God are of the household of the faith , may bear that yoke , not as a burden but_with joy , with love , with devotion ; that having lived our_lives in accordance_with_the laws of God s kingdom , we may receive full measure of good fruit , and counted by Christ good and faithful servants , we may be rendered partakers of eternal bliss and glory with_him in his heavenly kingdom . Let this_letter , Venerable Brethren , be a token to you of Our fatherly love as the Feast of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ draws near ; and receive the Apostolic Benediction as a pledge of divine blessings , which with loving heart , We impart to you , Venerable Brethren , to your_clergy , and to your_people .
