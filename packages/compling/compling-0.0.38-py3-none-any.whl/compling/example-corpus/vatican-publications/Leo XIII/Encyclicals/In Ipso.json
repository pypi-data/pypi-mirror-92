At the very_beginning of our Pontificate , as We reviewed the entire Catholic world , We found much cause for joy in the many and various good_works in which_the bishops , the secular and religious clergy , and the faithful_are constantly engaged . Nevertheless , it grieves Us to think_that the enemies of the Church , joined in most wicked conspiracy , scheme to weaken and even , if possible , utterly wipe out that wondrous edifice which God Himself has erected as a refuge for the human_race . This combat ardently waged against the Church far and wide , although carried on in different_ways for different places , has one established plan : to remove all traces of religion from families , schools , laws , and institutions ; to deprive the Church itself of its means of action and that singular virtue it possesses for the common_good ; and to infiltrate every vein , as it were , of domestic and civil_society with the most dangerous poison of their errors . And so these adversaries have left nothing untried ; their license has_been boundless . In number and with violence , they_have assailed the rights , liberty and dignity of the Church ; the bishops and all ranks of the clergy ; and especially_the authority of the Roman Pontiff as well as the Pontiff himself . As a result of these attacks on the Catholic name , grave ills have befallen nations . The enemies extend their perverse views ever_more widely , and the immorality and rebellion which accompany such views sweep away souls with the result that greater dangers daily threaten states and governments . Nor was any_other result to be expected . Religion -isaia- the strongest bulwark of the state . It can , by proper warning and salutary prohibition , hold people fast to their obligations . But when religion_-isaia- weakened , or worse still , tossed aside , then straightaway the foundations of society waver and are destroyed . Bishops Have United to Eradicate Evil . These evils We have openly denounced -atti_degli_apostoli- every opportunity . In Our communications , We have pointed_out to those in authority how closely the interests of religion and the state are intertwined , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time exhorting the faithful to properly cherish and diligently fulfill the teachings of the Church . But Our special appeal has_been directed to Our venerable brother bishops , whom_the Holy Spirit has set up as leaders in the Church and has imbued_with the abundant light of His grace . We urge them to keep watch as sentinels in all parts_of_the_world so that they_might know both what remedies are to be applied in the present circumstances and what snares are to be avoided in the case of each_individual nation . Thus they_should be Our best helpers in Our efforts to obtain the salvation of Catholic nations . And , indeed , We owe abundant thanks to God for the admirable unanimity and concern with_which_the entire body of bishops has responded to Our exhortation ; they use their talents and devotion to defend the Catholic faith and preserve human_society . They recall it to the virtues consonant with that_faith , away from the greatest ills , thus bringing it to true prosperity . In this so noble rivalry of pastoral zeal the Austrian bishops have distinguished themselves and deserve much praise . We know_how diligently you toil to eradicate from the German speaking peoples any trace of evil and to foster in them the seeds of Christian life . Indeed , We recently learned that_you collectively sent a letter to the faithful of your dioceses ; this proves the most profound union of your wills when there_-isaia- question of defending Catholic interests . Accordingly , that_this unanimity might flourish in the future and that_your efforts might proceed in the same pathway to the same determined end , it would be opportune for the bishops to hold annual conferences among_themselves ; these may be the source of a fruitful union of minds and action . Meetings like these already flourish in many places and have_already produced happy results . For , by this_means the bishops have_had a greater abundance of counsel made available to them . In addition , their resolution of spirit_has been strengthened , their zeal for things of religion has_been aroused , and no small number of decisions have_been carried_out which_are helpful for the Catholic enterprise . Moreover , such agreement has not_only increased the respect and immense gratitude of their_people toward them , but has_also encouraged lay_people , even of other nations , to deliberate equally harmoniously on how they_might best undertake the defense of religion , as well as the state , in its present affliction . Catholics Joining Forces . Indeed , from_these assemblies and exhortations on the part of bishops , Catholics have_been inspired to hold and attend similar assemblies on the national , provincial , or local level , an undertaking of the greatest foresight . For , if evil men , strong in numbers and acumen unite here and there and conspire together to treacherously deprive Catholics of the gift of faith and its attendant advantages , surely it -isaia- right and necessary_that Catholics should utilize their zeal and abilities to resist . In such gatherings , they_can more freely and firmly undertake the profession of their_faith and repel the enemy attacks upon it . Bond Between Laity and Hierarchy . Moreover , there_will be important subjects for the assembled bishops to discuss . In these calamitous and trying times , We judge that above all efforts should be made to unite the hierarchy with Christian families to effect a more_perfect union . Then the faithful may adhere to their bishops with all good_will and reverence , and in a special manner may bravely profess their fidelity , obedience , and filial piety toward_the bishop of the universal_church . For , surely , to support the view that the Roman Pontiff should_not be subject to any human power , but remain completely free , -isaia- the sacred obligation not of any_one nation , but of the whole Catholic world . Therefore the bishops with united minds and efforts should see_to_it_that the zeal of the faithful be aroused for this_most just cause and that_they urge its speedy accomplishment . In these same assemblies the bishops can conveniently communicate with one_another if some more complex problems have arisen in their local_churches ; also they_can discuss certain matters in common letters or decrees , if it seems useful . Likewise the care_for the formation and education of the clergy , which_-isaia- the greatest and most salutary concern_for a bishop , will occupy its place in these discussions : how the discipline of life in seminaries may conform to the norms of the Council of Trent ; by what principal means piety and noble qualities may be inculcated in the seminarians ; how they_can be encouraged to excel in higher learning ; and what methods the clergy can use to save souls . How to Guide the Faithful . As for the faithful , who_are exposed to such dangers and snares , propose various aids which_they can themselves apply : sermons on divine subjects ; catechetical instruction suitable for different persons , ages , and places , pious sodalities of many kinds , which_the Church recommends ; the proper observation of the religious feasts ; those institutes or works which_will preserve the faithful , especially young_people , from corruption and will encourage frequent reception of the sacraments ; finally , books , newspapers , and similar publications which_will advance the faith and safeguard morals . It -isaia-_very important_that you encourage Catholic writers and editors so that_they_may develop and extend publications in a more_effective way . Excellent writings of this_sort , which_are published regularly , have everywhere greatly helped both religion and the state , either because_they support and advance them directly or because in recanting the damaging writings of the adversaries , they restrain their improper contagion . In the Austrian empire their value -isaia- immense , since_the enemies of the Church publish their writings regularly . With their abundant means , they disseminate their publications easily and widely . Therefore , it -isaia- absolutely necessary to match for writing in equal number , and thus be able to blunt their weapons , detect their evil designs , check their malice , and promote the cause of duty and virtue . Accordingly , it will be helpful if each region has its_own newspapers champions , as it were , of the altar and hearth that conform to the prudence and direction of the bishop . Moreover , the clergy should benignly favor them and offer them the assistance of their learning ; Catholics should support them well . The Cause of Workers . In addition , another matter which_-isaia- close to your hearts must be safeguarded . In fact , you have_already sent a joint letter to the faithful . It -isaia- the cause of workers , who sorely need the support of religion both_for the honorable accomplishment of their labors and for the alleviation of their sufferings . Their cause -isaia- closely connected_with_the social_question ; the more difficulties it encounters , the more pressing -isaia- its need_for attention . If the bishops direct their attention to this_question , if they see_to_it_that justice and charity influence all classes of society and are deeply imprinted in souls , if by their authority and activity they come to the aid of the lowly condition of workers , they_will have deserved well of the Church and society alike . These and other important questions will be the subjects for deliberation -atti_degli_apostoli- the annual conferences of bishops which We wish to introduce . We are fully persuaded that all the bishops of Austria will carry_out these Our wishes , which a holy zeal for religion and the most benevolent charity toward your Catholic people inspire . Meanwhile , as a presage of divine graces and in testimony of Our paternal good wishes , dear sons , and venerable_brethren , We impart to you most affectionately in the Lord and to the whole Austrian nation the Apostolic Blessing .
