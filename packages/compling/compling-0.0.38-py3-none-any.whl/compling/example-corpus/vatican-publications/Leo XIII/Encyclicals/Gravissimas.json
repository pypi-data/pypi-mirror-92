In the midst of the serious concerns whichdistress Us more daily on account of the war declared on religious_orders inmany areas , the joint letter , eminent and full of dignity , which , in fulfillmentof your pastoral duty and your reverence for your Ruler , you recently sent toyour Faithful King , was an extraordinary consolation to Us . For nothing could bemore pleasing to Us than to see you promptly unite both to defend religiouscongregations and to support their needs and usefulness . Therefore nothingpleases Us more_than to approve your zeal and to honor your efforts with thepraise they deserve . Indeed , there_-isaia- little wonder if you , both as those_who preside over theChurch and also as citizens of Portugal , find fault with the recent decreesagainst religious societies . For it -isaia- clear that_they_are contrary to therights of the Church and to the rights of the faithful to choose a state oflife ; they deprive the state of not_a_few outstanding benefits which flow to itfrom religious institutes , as the authors of these decrees themselves admit inno uncertain manner . What must be thought of the conditions imposed by the government of Portugal on religious families if they_are to survive , you have_already eminently declared . This must be kept in mind throughout , however_,_that in accord with the discipline of the Catholic Church , no religious order can exist or prosper if its novitiate and vows are removed . Therefore the laws proper to each Institute , if perhaps necessary , are to be brought into conformity_with civil prescriptions ; but this_must only be done in such_a_way_that the dignity of the individual religious be preserved and , most importantly , that the nature of their holy state be kept entire and intact . With joined forces , you_must decide how to meet_the losses and dangers which oppress religious societies and in what fashion you_may more aptly provide_for their preservation in your midst . Indeed it -isaia- proper that the Holy See hand over to the joint judgment of those_who can weigh more_closely , by being present as you_are , the mind and intentions of the civil authorities and the circumstances of situations and places . For the rest , the Apostolic See itself will not_fail to take_care to draw up a suitable way_of_life according to proper norms and dispensation for religious forcefully removed from their domiciles . Continue therefore to strenuously defend the cause of religion and civilsociety , which_will only have a favorable outcome if you indicate toyour faithful a clear and proper method of acting in public . Continue also toexert every_effort to unite and increase Catholic forces and to fosterpublications and organizations which defend the Church s rights . Diligentlyfoster that harmony of wills which puts aside private opinions and partisanpolitical rivalries . These We most earnestly request of you . Finally , as a token of divine assistance and in testimony of our benevolencewe lovingly bestow on you , Venerable Brothers , and all thefaithful of Portugal and especially on members of religious_orders , theApostolic Blessing . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , May , in the th year of OurPontificate .
