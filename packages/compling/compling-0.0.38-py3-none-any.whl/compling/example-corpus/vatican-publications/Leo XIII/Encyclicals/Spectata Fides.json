Andrew and Gregory on the Coelian Hill , Archbishop of Westminster , and the other Bishops of England . Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Your proved fidelity and singular devotion to this Apostolic See are admirably shown in the Letter which We have lately received_from you . Our pleasure in receiving it -isaia- indeed increased by the further knowledge which it gives Us of your great vigilance and anxiety , in a matter where no care can be too great : We mean the Christian education of your children , upon which_you have lately taken counsel together , and have reported to us the decisions to which_you came . In this_work of so great moment , Venerable Brethren , We rejoice much to see_that you do not work alone ; for We know how_much -isaia- due to the whole_body of your_clergy . With the greatest charity , and with unconquered efforts , they_have provided schools for their_children ; and , with wonderful diligence and assiduity , they endeavour by their teaching to form them to a Christian life , and to instruct them in the elements of knowledge . Wherefore , with all the encouragement and praise that Our voice can_give , We bid your_clergy to go on in their meritorious work , and to be assured of Our special commendation and good_will , looking forward to a far greater reward from our Lord God for Whose sake they_are labouring . Not less worthy of commendation -isaia- the generosity of Catholics in this_matter . We know_how readily they supply what_-isaia- needed_for the maintenance of schools ; not_only those_who_are wealthy , but those also who_are of slender means , and poor ; and it -isaia- beautiful to see_how , often from the earnings of their poverty , they willingly contribute to the education of children . In these_days , and in the present condition of the world , when_the tender age of childhood -isaia- threatened on every side by so many and such various dangers , hardly anything can be imagined more fitting than the union with literary instruction of sound teaching in faith_and_morals . For this_reason We have more_than_once said_that We strongly approve of the Voluntary schools , which , by the work and liberality of private individuals , have_been established in France , in Belgium , in America , and in the colonies of the British Empire . We desire their increase , as much as possible , and that_they_may flourish in the number of their scholars . We Ourselves also , seeing the condition of things in this city , continue , with the greatest effort and -atti_degli_apostoli- great cost , to provide an abundance of such schools for the children of Rome . For it -isaia- in and by these schools that the Catholic faith , our greatest and best inheritance , -isaia- preserved whole and entire . In these schools the liberty of parents -isaia- respected ; and , what_-isaia- most needed , especially in the prevailing license of opinion and of action , it -isaia- by these schools that good citizens are brought up for the State ; for there_-isaia- no better citizen than the man_who has believed and practiced the Christian faith from his childhood . The beginning and , as it were , the seed of that_human perfection which Jesus Christ gave to mankind , are to be found in the Christian education of the young ; for the future condition of the State depends upon the early training of its children . The wisdom of our forefathers , and the very foundations of the State , are ruined by the destructive error of those_who would_have children brought up without religious education . You see , therefore Venerable Brethren , with what earnest forethought parents must beware of intrusting their_children to schools in which they_cannot receive religious teaching . In your_country of Great Britain We know_that , besides yourselves , very manyof your nation are_not a little anxious about religious education . They do notin all things agree with Us ; nevertheless they see_how important , for the sakeboth of society and of men individually , -isaia- the preservation of that Christianwisdom which your forefathers received through St . Augustine , from OurPredecessor , Gregory the Great : whichwisdom the violent tempests that came afterwards have_not entirely scattered . There are , as We know , -atti_degli_apostoli- this_day , many of an excellent disposition of mind , who_are diligently striving to retain what_they can of the ancient faith , and who bring forth many and great fruits of charity . As often as We think of this , so often are we deeply moved , for We love with a paternal charity that island which_was not undeservedly called the Mother of Saints ; and We see , in the disposition of mind of which We have spoken , the greatest hope and , as it were , a pledge of the welfare and prosperity of the British people . Go on , therefore , Venerable Brethren , in making the young your chief care ; press onward in every way your episcopal work ; and cultivate with alacrity andhopefulness whatever good seeds you find : for God , Who -isaia- rich in mercy willgive the increase . As a pledge of gifts from above , and in witness of Our good_will , We lovingly grant in the Lord to you , and to the clergy_and_people committed to each_one of you , the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the th day of November , in the year , the eighth year of Our Pontificate .
