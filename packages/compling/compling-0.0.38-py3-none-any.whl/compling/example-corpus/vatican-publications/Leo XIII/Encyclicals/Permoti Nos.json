As we experience a special friendship for your nation , and in response to the request of many of its citizens , We have directed particular attention to a serious matter for Belgian Catholics . You know well , of course , to what We are referring : the social_question . The burning discussions of this_question among_them have troubled their_minds to such an extent_that it clearly calls for attention and alleviation from Us . Disagreement Among Belgian Catholics . The question -isaia- intrinsically very difficult and , in your_country , it -isaia- bound up with_greater problems . Still , We have_not refused to address it , and particularly considering that_it_-isaia- necessarily connected_with religion and the duty of Our office . For in this area of instruction also it has pleased us to impart the teachings of Christian wisdom in a way suited to the age and its ways . And it -isaia- pleasant to recall that_these statements have yielded significant benefits both_for individuals and for states , and that_these results grow greater_than expected as the days go by . These good fruits have_been produced among Belgian Catholics as well , for their promptness to give support to instructions of this_kind was extraordinary ; still , these fruits were_not as great as were justly expected , considering the special character of the country and the people . The hindrance in this case -isaia- known well enough . For , while moved by good intentions , they insist wrongly on consulting others on these_matters . As a result , the many benefits they seek do not occur , and furthermore , discord among the Catholics flourishes . Debate on the Schools . We find this disagreement among Belgian Catholics extremely hard to bear , novel as it -isaia- , and ill omened . For prior to this , their mutual agreement always produced salutary effects . Their unity was , of course , clearly evident in the debate on the schools to mention a recent occurrence . For on that occasion , Catholics of every class were effectively bound together ; it was mainly because of this_that the affair turned out well , to the dignity of religion and the safety of the young . And now , your flocks are on the point of incurring dangerous losses both individually and as a group because_they_are disunited and pursuing different objectives ; you see_how ripe the time -isaia- for laying a healing hand on these troubled events . We strongly support your efforts to restore and strengthen concord . The great reverence in which your faithful hold you indicates that_you will be successful . To this_end , We suggest that_you gather together for a congress as soon as it can be arranged . By sharing your views -atti_degli_apostoli- that congress , you will_be_able to study in fuller detail the extent of the question , and to consider better means of settling it . This question cannot be regarded from one standpoint only . It -isaia- indeedconcerned with external goods , but_it_-isaia- preeminently concerned_with religionand morals . It -isaia-_also directly connected_with_the civil constitution of thelaws , so that in the last analysis , it has a broad reference to the rights andduties of all classes . Furthermore , when we apply the evangelical principles ofjustice and charity to this_question and to the conduct of life , the manifoldinterests of private individuals are necessarily affected . And to theseconsiderations must be added certain conditions of business and industry , ofworkers and owners which_are specifically peculiar to Belgium . These difficult problems , for_which your judgment and attentiveness must findsolutions , are of great_importance and We shall_not leave you without Ourproposals in the present affair . In this_way after_the conclusion of thecongress , it will be less laborious and less dangerous for you to decide , eachone of you in your_own diocese , on remedies and stabilizing action suited to thepeople and the districts . Still you_should , with the help of suitable citizens , apply these measures in such_a_way_that they may_have a similar effectnationwide . The action undertaken by Catholics starting from the same points andtravelling as far_as_possible along the same paths should be observed everywhereto be one_and_the_same action . Consequently this action should be honest , vigorous , and productive . To facilitate this , Catholics must urgently wish forand pursue only those goals which_are seen quite truly to lead to the commongood , in preference to their_own personal opinions and interests . This wouldensure : that religion excels in its_own function and spreads its power , apower which brings safety to civil , domestic , and economic affairs as well , in awonderful way ; that by uniting public_authority and freedom in a Christianmanner , the kingdom remains unharmed by sedition andprotected by tranquillity ; that the good institutions of the state , especially_the schools of the young , are promoted and improved ; that commerce and crafts are improved , especially by the help of those societies , each with its_own particular purpose , which abound in your_country and which_it_-isaia- desirable to develop further with religion as leader and support . Nor -isaia- it a matter of small importance to ensure_that the supreme counsels of God be accepted with the modesty which_-isaia- obviously their due . Since God has ordered that different classes exist in the human_race , but_that among_those classes an equality deriving from their friendly cooperation also exists , workers should in no way abandon their respect_for and trust in their employers , and the employers should treat their workers with just kindness and prudent care . These are the main constituents of the common_good whose acquisition must bethe goal of our efforts . From this good comes real alleviation to solace thecondition of mortal life and from it too derives merits for heavenly life . IfCatholics persist in loving with_greater zeal the order taught by this Christianwisdom and in strengthening it by their example , the outcome which_-isaia- hoped forwill more readily come to pass . When this happens , those_who strayed from thepath , deceived either by wrong opinion or by false appearances , would onregaining their senses seek the protection and guidance of the Church . Surely noCatholic who truly loves his religion and his country will refuse to accept yourdecisions . They realize every improvement contributes to stability and leads togreater benefits if it -isaia- introduced gradually and moderately . In the meantime , the present situation -isaia- so serious that a remedy for it should_not be delayed . That remedy should begin with the calming of men s minds . Therefore , Venerable Brothers , address the Catholics in Our name and warn them to refrain completely from all controversy and argumentation on these issues , whether -atti_degli_apostoli- meetings or in newspapers and similar publications . More especially , urge them to stop blaming each_other , and not to anticipate the judgment of the lawful government . Then let_them all with united brotherly minds strive with you to devote their greatest attention and effort to achieving their goal . The clergy should lead the way since it -isaia-_especially characteristic of them to be wary in the face of novel opinions , to soothe and unite men s minds in the name of religion , and to recall_the duties ofChristian citizens . Our Expectations of the Belgians . We have long embraced the noble Belgian nation with Our special love andcare , and Belgium in turn , enlivened by the ancestral religion , has offered Usmany evidences of obedience and loving devotion . So there_-isaia- little doubt thatOur Catholic sons will receive and carry_out religiously these exhortations andcommands with a will equal to Our purpose in issuing them . For they_will certainly never allow their discord to lessen and destroy imprudently that public regard_for their religion which their concord has long fostered and which many a country envies them . Let them rather act in the closest concert in order to oppose all theirplans and strength to the wickedness of Socialism , which very clearly will causeevils and great losses . For it -isaia- constantly and in every way exerting itselfviolently against religion and the state ; it -isaia- striving every_day to throw bothdivine and human laws into confusion and to destroy the good_works ofevangelical providence . Our voice has_been raised often and vehemently againstthis great calamity , as thecommands and warnings which We gave in the Letter Rerum Novarum sufficiently testify . So to this_purpose all good men should direct their_minds to the exclusion of factional interests . They should uphold the sacred order of God and of their_country without_doubt , in their legitimate fight on behalf of Christian truth , justice , and charity . For it -isaia- from this order_that public safety and happiness spring . It -isaia- only right for Us to be willing to rest Our trust and expectation inthese matters on your deliberation and ingenuity in particular . Therefore , whileWe beseech for you the ample helps of divine aid , We most lovingly impart to youyourselves and to the clergy_and_people of each_one of you the Apostolicblessing . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , July , in the eighteenth year of Our Pontificate .
