Dear Son and Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction ! During these last years the cause of Catholicism has undergone , in Belgium , multiplied trials . We have , however , found comfort and consolation in the tokens of persistent love and fidelity which Belgian Catholics have furnished us so abundantly whenever they_have had an occasion . And , above all , what_has strengthened us , and still gives us strength , -isaia- your signal attachment to our person , and the zeal which_you exert in order_that the Christian people confided to your_care may persevere in the sincerity and unity of the Catholic Faith , and may progress each_day in its love for the Church of Christ and his Vicar . It -isaia- pleasant for us to give special praise to your solicitude in encouraging by all the means possible a good education for the young , and in insuring to the children of the primary schools a religious education established on broad foundations . Your zeal -isaia- applied with equal watchfulness to all that tends to the advantage of Christian education in the Colleges and Institutes , as well as to the Catholic University of Louvain . On the other_hand , we cannot remain indifferent , or -atti_degli_apostoli- peace , in presence of events which_would seem to imperil amongst Belgians the good understanding between Catholic citizens , and to divide them_into opposing camps . It would be superfluous to recall here_the causes and occasions of these differences , and the encouragement they_have met with where it ought least to have_been expected . All these details , Dear Son and Venerable Brethren , you_know better_than any_one ; and you deplore them_with us , knowing perfectly that -atti_degli_apostoli- no other epoch could the necessity of assuring and maintaining union amongst Catholics be so great as -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment , when_the enemies of the name of Christianity rage on all sides against the Church in an unanimous attack . Full of solicitude for_this union , we point_out the dangers which threaten it arising from certain controversies concerning public law ; a subject which , amongst you , engenders a strong difference of feeling . These controversies have for their object the necessity or opportuneness of conforming to the prescriptions of Catholic doctrine the existing forms of government , based on what_-isaia- commonly called modern law . Most assuredly we , more_than any_one , ought heartily to desire_that human_society should be governed in a Christian manner , and that the divine influence of Christ should penetrate and completely impregnate all orders of the State . From the commencement of our Pontificate we manifested , without delay , that_such was our settled opinion ; and that by public documents , and especially by the Encyclical Letters we published against the errors of Socialism , and , quite recently , upon the Civil Power . Nevertheless , all Catholics , if they wish to exert themselves profitably for the common_good , should_have before their_eyes and faithfully imitate the prudent conduct which_the Church herself adopts in matters of this nature : she maintains and defends in all their integrity the sacred doctrines and principles of right with inviolable firmness , and applies herself with all her power to regulating the institutions and the customs of public order , as well as the acts of private life , upon these same principles . Nevertheless , she observes in this_the just measure of time_and_place ; and , as commonly happens in human affairs , she -isaia-_often constrained to tolerate -atti_degli_apostoli- times evils that it would be almost impossible to prevent , without exposing herself to calamities and troubles still_more disastrous . Moreover , in polemical discussions , care should be taken not to overstep those just limits that justice and charity alike mark out , and not rashly to throw blame or suspicion upon men otherwise devoted to the doctrines of the Church ; and , above all , upon those_who in the Church itself are raised to dignity and power . We deplore that_this has_been done in your case , Dear Son , who , in your quality of archbishop , administer the diocese of Malines ; and who , for your signal services to the Church , and for your zeal in defending Catholic doctrine , have_been judged worthy by our Predecessor of blessed memory , Pius IX . , to take a place in the College of most Eminent Cardinals . It -isaia- manifest that the facility with_which unfounded accusations are levelled vaguely against one s neighbour , does injury to the good name of others , and weakens the bonds of charity ; and that it outrages those '' whom_the Holy Ghost has placed to govern_the Church of God . '' For this_reason do we desire with_all_our power , and hereby most seriously enjoin , that Catholics abstain from this conduct . Let it suffice to them to remember that_it_-isaia- to the Apostolic See and to the Roman Pontiff , to whom all have access , that_has_been confided the charge of defending everywhere Catholic truths , and of watching that no error whatsoever , capable of doing injury to the doctrine of faith_and_morals , or apparently in contradiction with it , be spread or propagated in the Church . In what concerns yourselves , Dear Son and Venerable Brethren , use all your vigilance so that all men of science , and those , most especially , to whom_you have confided the charge of teaching youth , be of one accord , and unanimous in all those questions upon which_the teaching of the Holy See allows no freedom of opinion . And as to points left to the discussion of the learned , may their intellects , owing to your inspiration and your advice , be so exercised upon them that the divergences of opinion destroy not union of heart and concord of will . On this_subject the Sovereign Pontiff , Benedict XIV . , our immortal predecessor , has left in his Constitution Sollicita ac provides , certain rules for men of study , full of wisdom and authority . He has even proposed to them , as a model to imitate in this_matter , St . Thomas Aquinas , whose moderation of language and maturity of style are maintained as well in the combat against adversaries , as in the exposition of doctrine and the proofs destined for its defence . We wish to renew to learned men the recommendations of our predecessor , and to point_out to them this noble model , who_will teach them not_only the manner of carrying on controversy with opponents , but_also the character of the doctrine to be held and developed in the cultivation of philosophy and theology . On many occasions , Dear Son and Venerable Brethren , we have expressed to you our earnest desire of seeing the wisdom of St . Thomas reinstated in Catholic schools , and everywhere treated with the highest consideration . We have likewise exhorted you to establish in the University of Louvain the teaching of higher philosophy in the spirit of St . In this_matter , as in all others , we have found you entirely ready to condescend to our wishes and to fulfill our will . Pursue then , with zeal , the task which_has_been begun , and watch with care that in this_same University the fruitful sources of Christian philosophy , which spring from the works of St . Thomas , be open to students in a rich abundance , and applied to the profit of all other branches of instruction . In the execution of this design , if you_have need of our aid or our counsels , they_shall never be wanting to you . In the meantime , we pray God , the Source of Wisdom , the Author of Peace , and the Friend of Charity , to accord you His favourable help in the present conjuncture , and we ask him for all an abundance of Heavenly gifts . As an augury of these graces , and as a sign of our special benevolence , we accord , with a loving heart , our Apostolic benediction to you , Dear Son and Venerable Brethren , to all your Clergy , and to the people confided to your charge .
