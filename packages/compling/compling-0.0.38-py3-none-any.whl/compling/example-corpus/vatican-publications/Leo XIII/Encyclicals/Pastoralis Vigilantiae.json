Cardinal Netto , Patriarch of Lisbon , Americo S . Cardinal Dos Santos Silva , Bishop of Oporto ; and to Our Venerable Brethren Antony , Archbishop of Braga , and to the other Archbishops and Bishops of Portugal . Beloved Sons , Venerable Brethren : Health and the Apostolic Benediction . The noble Congress lately held -atti_degli_apostoli- Braga , the news of which a very welcome letter on the part of those_who were present conveyed to Us -atti_degli_apostoli- its completion , has_given another proof of the Pastoral watchfulness wherewith you devote your efforts to the preservation and strengthening of religion . In reading that letter We were delighted both with the solicitous zeal of the Bishop of the diocese where_the Congress was received one_who was_the chief founder of the movement , and presided over it to successful issues and with the piety and energy of the Bishops who_were associated_with him or had sent worthy representatives to the Congress , and with the notable gathering of men chosen carefully from the clergy and laity , pre eminent in learning , virtue , and authority . '' That Congress was_the more gratifying to Us on account of the admirable unanimity of principle in the determination of such decisions as would most powerfully work_for the prosperity of the Church and the progress of Catholicity . Nor will We conceal that , beside the resolutions which_were opportunely carried by unanimous consent as peculiarly appropriate to the time and the place , those propositions which expressed the devoted sentiment and zeal of the members towards_the Apostolic See , to the effect that due honour should ever be paid to its dignity , and that no title of its majesty or its rights should be reft from it , brought to Us no little comfort . We are indeed of good hope_that the resolutions which_were agreed upon -atti_degli_apostoli- that Congress , so long as they_are observed with care and perseverance , will effect a plentiful harvest of fruitfulness ; but We find Ourselves compelled to observe that a rich field still remains that demands your labour and your industry . Wherefore , although quite recently We addressed you by letter on the Catholic position and its needs in Portugal , and of the course to be pursued for their most convenient accomplishment , nevertheless We are induced to add to that letter some words_which We hold fitting to communicate to you , lest , since an occasion for writing to you has occurred , We should seem to be wanting in duty . You must be aware , beloved_sons , Venerable Brethren , of the truth_which was perfectly appreciated -atti_degli_apostoli- the Congressof Braga , that it has come to pass that the faith itself_-isaia- among many indanger , and that every_effort must be made , that , through ignorance orindifference , it should_not fall and fail from souls , but_rather that it shouldtake deep root in hearts and should bring forth in good_works and the practiceof virtue a glad and plentiful sweetness of perfect fruits . Strife must be madeagainst the attempts of the enemies of truth , lest the evil stain which dropsfrom their bad example and their widely disseminated teaching should spread moreand more . Many wounds are to be healed which_the dishonest toil of such men , andthe unhappiness of the times , have struck in the flocks committed to your_care , many ruins are to be built up , many hardships still oppress the souls of thefaithful , which though haply it -isaia- impossible to destroy them may -atti_degli_apostoli- least belightened . These needs which , as We have_said , demand your_care and your industry , willbe more_fully and more suitably attended to if day_by_day the concord betweenthe Bishops -isaia- strengthened , and if their work_-isaia- made more co operative inremedying the needs of clergy and laity , in taking counsel and in making suchdecisions as shall seem to align best with the common_good , both_for theparticular requirements of separate dioceses , and for those_that reach fartherand rise higher , with_which_the prosperity and the weal of the whole_people areassociated . The convenience of a stricter bond of union between_the Bishops didnot escape the prudence of those_who met -atti_degli_apostoli- Braga . Wherefore those resolutionsof that great Congress were_the most gratifying to Us which recommended thefounding of such a bond , through_which the faithful look for ampler and lastingbenefits from those rulers who_are their directors and their guides . Now to achieve this permanent and perfect union nothing_-isaia- more_effective than the custom already practised in other countries , that besides the Congresses -atti_degli_apostoli- which_the laity assist such as the Congress of Braga there_should be every year special meetings of the Bishops , a custom which_you have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , and which We greatly desire to see introduced among_you , since_the benefits accruing by its means to religion are made evident by the manifold and constant testimony of experience . For from the habit of such Congresses there first follows , as we have_said , a notable unanimity and compactness of strength , which of itself_-isaia- potent to bring great designs to successful issues ; moreover , the hearts of the Bishops are_more keenly moved to action , confidence -isaia- confirmed , and minds are enlightened by common counsel and the light of wisdom shining from one to another . In addition to this , by these Conferences , the way -isaia- in a manner prepared both_for diocesan and for provincial Synods , and for the meeting of the National Council , for the holding of which We rejoice to know_that you_are anxious , since Our long experience of the advantage to be gained therefrom strongly approves of it , and the prescriptions of the sacred canons commend it in a marked manner . Moreover , from the Annual Congresses of Bishops , of which We speak , this_great benefit also flows , that the laity , moved to greater zeal by new impulses , resolve to walk in the paths set for them , themselves to hold meetings , to join in council , and by a union of strength to strive for the common cause of religion , and in obedience to their pastors to perform sedulously those duties which_they accept from their teachings and exhortations . Nor in your annual assemblies will you find that_there_-isaia- lack of matter whereunto to devote your zeal and your energy . For beyond_the special business of the separate dioceses , which_can more_easily be furthered under the light of a shared experience , the ordering of those works which_are most effective for rousing the zeal of the priesthood already labouring in the Lord s vineyard , and for the education of students who_will one_day have to shine in the house of God with the light of solid wisdom , with the merit of a true ecclesiastical spirit , with every sacerdotal virtue this_will afford a large field of work to your prudence and your common deliberations . Another matter which_will require your fatherly watchfulness will be the diligent inquiry into the means of best filling the mind of the people_with the rudiments of faith , of directing their morals , of circulating writings which sow the seed of true faith and make for virtue , of setting a foot works which shall pour out the benefits of charity and of securing that_those already founded shall be confirmed in new strength . Finally , a very_important subject of your debates will consist in the opportunity afforded to you of founding and affiliating religious societies in Portugal , the interests of which We rejoiced to see_that all who met -atti_degli_apostoli- Braga had deeply -atti_degli_apostoli- heart . For these sodalities not_only contribute as it were auxiliary forces to the clergy who follow in your dioceses the sacred army of Christ , but_also this_-isaia- of crucial importance they_will supply apostolic men for the work of the holy missions in countries subject to the dominion of Portugal in lands beyond_the seas . The fulfilment of this function will work both_for the prosperity of Christ s kingdom on earth , and for the glory and honour of the Portuguese name . In truth your rulers and your ancestry have obtained a deathless glory in that_they carried to the vast regions discovered by them the light of gospel truth , together_with a higher civilisation , under the favour and assistance of the Apostolic See . But that the strength and glory of these noble beginnings may still remain and may never fail from that ancient stability and splendour , there_-isaia- need that_they be upheld by the unwavering care and support of eminent men , who filled_with_the Divine Spirit and ever vigilant against the hostile attacks of heretics , shall devote all their zeal , all their energy , that the benefits which_have flowed out of Portugal into these countries may , so far from waning , flourish with the infusion of a fresh strength . It will be the duty of such men to effect that_they who already believe in God may be increased in faith ; that_they whose faith_-isaia- strong may practise the ideals of honourable living , religious worship , diligence in duty s fulfilment ; lastly , that_they who still lie in darkness may be brought to the knowledge of the true God and to the light of the Gospel . Now the religious associations whose members , in the judgment of prudent men to which_the experience of all time testifies have fulfilled this ministry ofsalvation no less gladly than laboriously , will_be_able to supply many menburning with holy zeal . For the rule and discipline of the societies to whichthey belong , as well as the virtue of each trained in constant exercise , islikeliest to produce men efficient before all others for_such work as this . We are indeed persuaded that the Portuguese Government lending a favourable hearing to your counsels , and judging -atti_degli_apostoli- their highest value those benefits which come before all others , will of its_own accord abolish all the obstacles that block the way to the liberty of those societies , and will lend its aid to further your endeavours which_are directed to this_end , that the Catholic religion may flourish and grow strong with its ancestral glory , in Portugal and in all the lands subjected to her sway . We are the more_easily persuaded of this , inasmuch as none can be ignorant , since_it_-isaia- known fully to you , what_are Our desires and prayers in this_matter . Moreover , while they_are connected_with_the good of religion , they no less work_for the solid prosperity of the Portuguese nation . For this_gift , this possession , was granted to the Church by her Divine Founder , that_she should be in the common society of men a bond of peace and the guardian of salvation . Wherefore the Church in no way weakens the power of those_who rule_the State , rather she supports and strengthens it , in conferring on the laws that spring from this_power the sanction of religion , in reckoning among the obligations laid upon mankind by God a due reverence for authority , in warning citizens to refrain from sedition and all disturbance in the State , in teaching all to practise virtue , and conscientiously to fulfil the duties that belong to their condition in life . Therefore -isaia- the Church the pinnacle of morality , and by her salutary discipline she trains citizens to be upright , honourable , patriotic , faithful and very steadfast to duty , to be such men in fine as stand for an immovable foundation in the public ordering of the State , and as give to it an unconquerable strength for the achievement of every noble and high ideal . Therefore -isaia- it to the State s high advantage to leave to the Church that liberty of action which_she demands of right , and to prepare a friendly path where she may_be_able to touch far lands with_her beneficial powers , and to employ all the gifts of her endowment for the common_good . Now although this_doctrine -isaia- applicable to all nations , most specially doesit affect the Portuguese , among whom_the influence of the Catholic religion intraining the character and disposition of men , in fostering the studies ofscience , letters , and arts , in kindling the soul to every civic and militaryvirtue , has_been so great , even so that_she seems as it were_the mother andnurse given from on High to bring forth and train whatever gentleness , dignity , and glory shone out in that race . On this_subject We have treated more_fully in the recorded Encyclical letter which lately We addressed to you ; what_-isaia- important to recall -atti_degli_apostoli- present -isaia- that the power of religion should suffer no darkening , because those doctrines which_the Church , under God , teaches , are restrained by no limits of time_and_place , but are_bound up with the salvation and comfort of all people . This -isaia- the reason_why those high benefits and strong safeguards , which_she brought of old time to your noble nation , she_-isaia- still ready to bring for the advancement of your prosperity and your fame . And particularly -atti_degli_apostoli- this unhappy time , when weakness of spirit so abounds that the highest principles upon which_the order and tranquillity of human_society depend are boldly attacked , nay are brought even to totter , none can be ignorant how necessary -isaia- the observance of religion and those holy counsels and teachings which religion enforces . It -isaia- the unanimous agreement of all principled and honourable men , that_there_-isaia- no remedy more efficacious and potent against the evils by which Our age -isaia- oppressed , and against the perils in store , than the Catholic doctrine , if it be received whole and incorrupt , and if mankind walk in that way_of_life which its practice demands . Wherefore We do not doubt , beloved_sons , Venerable Brethren , that_you will , with your well_known pastoral zeal , hasten withstrength and constancy of spirit to set your hands to the work we have commendedto you . Thus will it be your high praise and just congratulation that in yourlabours you were able to deserve most nobly of the religion which_you uphold sowell , and of your_country and your race , for_whom you , no less_than Ourselves , greatly desire an unbroken tranquillity and a lease of perfect prosperity . Meantime , praying God to fill you with His good gifts and graciously tofavour your designs , We grant lovingly in the Lord the Apostolic Benediction , inwitness of Our fatherly affection , to you and to the clergy and faithfulentrusted to your_care .
