Deplorable Conditions in Italy Guardians of that_faith to which_the Christian nations owe their morality and civil redemption , We must dutifully discharge each_one of Our supreme tasks . Therefore We must raise Our voice in loud protestations against the impious war which tries to take such a precious treasure away from you , beloved_children . Already taught by long and sorrowful experience , you_know well the terrible trials of this war , you_who deplore it in your hearts as Catholics and as Italians . Can one be Italian in name and sentiment and not resent these continual offenses against divine beliefs ? These beliefs are the most beautiful of our glories , for they gave to Italy its primacy over the other nations and to Rome the spiritual sceptre of the world . They likewise made the wonderful edifice of Christian civilization rise over the ruins of paganism and barbarism . Can we be Catholic in mind_and_heart and gaze with dry eyes on that land where our wondrous Redeemer deigned to establish the seat of His kingdom ? Now We see His teachings attacked and His reverence outraged , His Church embattled and His Vicar opposed . So many souls redeemed by His blood are_now lost , the choicest portion of His flock , a people faithful to Him for nineteen centuries . How can We bear to look upon His chosen people exposed to a constant and ever present danger of apostasy , pushed toward error and vice , material miseries , and moral degradation ? Threat of Masonry . This war -isaia-_directed -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time against the heavenly and the earthly kingdoms , against the faith of our ancestors and the culture which_they handed on to us . It -isaia- thus doubly evil , being guilty of a divine offense no less_than a human one . Is its chief source not that_very masonic sect which We discussed -atti_degli_apostoli- length in the encyclical Humanum genus of April , , and in the more_recent one of October , , addressed to the bishops , the clergy and the Italian people ? With these_two letters We tore from the face of masonry the mask which it used to hide itself and We showed it in its crude deformity and dark fatal activity . We shall restrict Ourselves now to its deplorable effects on Italy . For a long time now it has bored its way under the deceitful guise of a philanthropic society and redeemer of the Italian people . By way of conspiracies , corruptions , and violences , it has finally come to dominate Italy and even Rome . To what troubles , to what calamities has it opened the way in a little more_than thirty years ? Troubles Caused by Masonry . Our country has seen and suffered great evils in such a short span of time , for the faith of our fathers has been_made a sign for persecutions of every sort . The satanic intent of the persecutors has_been to substitute naturalism for Christianity , the worship of reason_for the worship of faith , so called independent morality for Catholic morality , and material progress for spiritual progress . To the holy maxims and laws of the Gospel , they_have opposed laws and maxims which_can be called the code of revolution . They have_also opposed an atheistic doctrine and a vile realism to school , science , and the Christian arts . Having invaded the temple of the Lord , they_have squandered the booty of the Church s goods , the greatest part of the inheritance necessary_for the ministers , and reduced the number of priests by the conscription of clerics beyond_the limits of extreme need . If the administration of the sacraments could_not be impeded , they sought nonetheless to introduce and promote civil marriages and funerals . If they_have not_yet succeeded in seizing control of education and the direction of charitable institutions , they always aim with perseverance to laicize everything , which_-isaia- to remove the mark of Christianity from it . If they could_not silence the voice of the Catholic press , they made every_effort to discredit and revile it . Contradictions in the Masonic Program . In this battle against the Catholic religion , what partiality and contradictions there_are ! They closed monasteries and convents , but_they let multiply -atti_degli_apostoli- will masonic lodges and sectarian dens . They proclaimed the right of association , while the legal rights which all kinds of organizations use and abuse are denied to religious societies . They proclaim freedom of religion and reserve odious intolerance and vexations precisely for the religion of the Italians which , for that_reason , should be assured respect and a special protection . They made protests and great promises for the protection of the dignity and independence of the pope , but you see their_daily contempt of Our person . All kinds of public shows find an open field ; yet this or that Catholic demonstration -isaia- either prohibited or disturbed . They encourage schisms , apostasies , and revolts against legitimate superiors in the Church . Religious vows and especially religious obedience are rebuked as contrary to human_dignity and freedom , while impious associations which bind their followers by wicked oaths and demand blind , absolute obedience in crime are allowed to flourish with impunity . The Spirit of Masonry . We do not wish to exaggerate the masonic power by attributing to its direct and immediate action all the evils which presently preoccupy Us . However , you can clearly see its spirit in the facts which We have just recorded and in many_others which We could recall . That spirit , which_-isaia- the implacable enemy of Christ and of the Church , tries all ways , uses all arts , and prevails upon all means . It seizes from the Church its first born daughter and seizes from Christ His favored nation , the seat of His Vicar on earth and the center of Catholic unity . To see the evil and efficacious influence of this_spirit on our affairs , We have more_than a few fleeting indications and the series of facts which_have succeeded themselves for thirty years . Proud of its successes , the sect herself has spoken out and told us all its past accomplishments and future goals . It regards the public powers as its instruments , wining or not , which_-isaia- to say that the impious sect boasts as one of its principal works the religious persecution which_has troubled and -isaia- troubling our Italy . Though often executed by other hands , this persecution -isaia- inspired and promoted by masonry , in an immediate or mediate , direct or indirect manner , by flattery or threats , seduction or revolution . Social Evils of Masonry . The road -isaia-_very short from religious to social ruin . The heart of man -isaia-_no_longer raised to heavenly hopes and loves ; capable and needing the infinite , it throws itself insatiably on the goods of this earth . Inevitably there_-isaia- a perpetual struggle of avid passions to enjoy , become rich , and rise . Then we encounter a large and inexhaustible source of grudges , discords , corruptions , and crimes . In our Italy there_was no lack of moral and social disorders before the present events but_what a sorrowful spectacle we see in our days ! That loving respect which forms domestic harmony -isaia- substantially diminished ; paternal authority_-isaia- too_often unrecognized by children and parents alike . Disagreements are frequent , divorce common . Civil discords and resentful anger between_the various orders increase every_day in the cities . New generations which grew up in a spirit of misunderstood freedom are unleashed in the cities , generations which do not respect anything from above or below . The cities teem with incitements to vice , precocious crimes , and public scandals . The state should be content with the high and noble office of recognizing , protecting , and helping divine and human_rights in their harmonious universality . Now , however , the state believes itself almost a judge and disowns these rights or restricts them -atti_degli_apostoli- will . Finally , the general social_order -isaia- undermined -atti_degli_apostoli- its foundations . Books and journals , schools and universities , clubs and theaters , monuments and political discourse , photographs and the fine arts , everything conspires to pervert minds and corrupt hearts . Meanwhile the oppressed and suffering people tremble and the anarchic sects arouse themselves . The working classes raise their heads and go to swell the ranks of socialism , communism , and anarchy . Characters exhaust themselves and many souls , no longer knowing how to suffer nobly nor how to redeem themselves manfully , take their_lives with cowardly suicide . Such are the fruits which_the masonic sect has borne to us Italians . And after that it yearns to come before you , extolling its merits towards . It likewise yearns to give Us and all those_who , heeding Our words , remain faithful to Jesus Christ , the calumnious title of enemies of the state . The facts reveal the merits of this guilty sect toward our peninsula , '' merits '' which bear repeating . The facts say that masonic patriotism -isaia- no less_than sectarian egotism which yearns to dominate everything , particularly the modern states which unite and concentrate everything in their hands . The facts say that in the plans of masonry , the names of political independence , equality , civilization , and progress aimed to facilitate the independence of man from God in our country . From them , license of error and vice and union of faction -atti_degli_apostoli- the expense of other citizens have grown . The easy and delicious enjoyment of life by the world s fortunate -isaia- nurtured in the same source . A people redeemed by divine blood have thus returned to divisions , corruptions , and the shames of paganism . Evil Nature of Masonry . That does_not surprise Us . After nineteen centuries of Christian civilization , this sect tries to overthrow the Catholic Church and to cut off its divine sources . It absolutely denies the supernatural , repudiating every revelation and all the means of salvation which revelation shows us . Through its plans and works , it bases itself solely and entirely on such a weak and corrupt nature as ours . Such a sect cannot be anything other_than the height of pride , greed , and sensuality . Now , pride oppresses , greed plunders , and sensuality corrupts . When these three concupiscences are brought to the extreme , the oppressions , greed , and seductive corruptions spread slowly . They take on boundless dimensions and become the oppression , plundering and source of corruption of an entire people . Let Us then show you masonry as an enemy of God , Church , and country . Recognize it as such once and for all , and with all the weapons which reason , conscience , and faith put in your hands , defend yourselves from such a proud foe . Let no one be taken in by its attractive appearance or allured by its promises ; do not be seduced by its enticements or frightened by its threats . Remember that Christianity and masonry are essentially irreconcilable , such that to join one_-isaia- to divorce the other . You can no longer ignore such incompatibility between Catholic and mason , beloved_children : you have_been warned openly by Our predecessors , and We have loudly repeated the warning . Christian Response to Masonry . Those who , by some supreme misfortune , have_given their name to one of these societies of perdition should know that_they_are strictly bound to separate themselves from it . Otherwise they_must remain separated_from Christian communion and lose their soul now and for eternity . Parents , teachers , godparents , and whoever has care of others should_also know_that a rigorous duty binds them to keep their wards from this guilty sect or to draw them_from it if they have_already entered . In a matter of such importance and where_the seduction -isaia- so easy in these times , it -isaia- urgent that the Christian watch himself from the beginning . He should fear the least danger , avoid every occasion , and take the greatest precautions . Use all the prudence of the serpent , while keeping in your heart_the simplicity of the dove , according to the evangelical counsel . Fathers and mothers should be wary of inviting strangers into_their homes or admitting them to domestic intimacy , -atti_degli_apostoli- least insofar as their faith_-isaia- not sufficiently known . They should try to first ascertain that an astute recruiter of the sect does_not hide himself in the guise of a friend , teacher , doctor or other benefactor . Oh , in how_many families has the wolf penetrated in sheep s clothing ! Masonic Threat to Groups . It -isaia- beautiful to see the varied groups which arise everywhere today in every order of social_life : worker groups , groups of mutual aid and social security , organizations to promote science , arts , letters , and other similar things . When they_are inspired by a good moral and religious spirit , these groups certainly prove to be useful and proper . But because the masonic poison has penetrated and continues to penetrate here also , especially here , any groups that remove themselves from religious influence should be generally suspect . They can easily be directed and more_or_less dominated by masons , becoming the sowing ground and the apprenticeship of the sect in addition to providing assistance to it . Women should_not join philanthropic societies whose nature and purpose are_not well_known without first seeking advice from wise and experienced people . That talkative philanthropy which_-isaia- opposed to Christian charity with_such pomp -isaia-_often the passport for masonic business . Everyone should avoid familiarity or friendship with anyone suspected of belonging to masonry or to affiliated groups . Know them by their fruits and avoid them . Every familiarity should be avoided , not_only with_those impious libertines who openly promote the character of the sect , but_also with_those_who hide under the mask of universal tolerance , respect_for all religions , and the craving to reconcile the maxims of the Gospel with_those of the revolution . These men seek to reconcile Christ and Belial , the Church of God and the state without God . Every Christian should shun books and journals which distill the poison of impiety and which stir up the fire of unrestrained desires or sensual passions . Groups and reading clubs where_the masonic spirit stalks its prey should be likewise shunned . The Offensive Against Masonry . In addition , since we are dealing_with a sect which_has pervaded everything , it -isaia-_not_enough to remain on the defensive . We must courageously go out into the battlefield and confront it . That -isaia- what_you will do , beloved_children , opposing press to press , school to school , organization to organization , congress to congress , action to action . Masonry has_taken control of the public schools , leaving private schools , paternal schools , and those directed by zealous ecclesiastics and religious of both sexes to compete in the education of Christian youth . Christian parents especially should_not entrust the education of their_children to uncertain schools . Masonry has confiscated the inheritance of public charity ; fill the void , then , with the treasure of private relief . It has placed pious works in the hands of its followers , so you_should entrust those_that depend on you to Catholic institutions . It opens and maintains houses of vice , leaving you to do what_-isaia- possible to open and maintain shelters for honesty in danger . An anti Christian press in religious and secular matters militates -atti_degli_apostoli- its expense , so that_your effort and money are required by the Catholic press . Masonry establishes societies of mutual help and credit unions for its partisans ; you_should do the same not_only_for your brothers but_for all the indigent . This will show that true and sincere charity_-isaia- the daughter of the One who makes_the sun to rise and the rain to fall on the just man and sinner alike . May this struggle between good_and_evil extend to everything , and may good prevail . Masonry holds frequent meetings to plan new ways to combat the Church , and you_should hold them frequently to better agree on the means and order of defense . It multiplies its lodges , so that you_should multiply Catholic clubs and parochial groups , promote charitable associations and prayer organizations , and maintain and increase the splendor of the temple of God . The sect , having nothing to fear , today shows its face to the light of day . You Italian Catholics should_also make open profession of your faith and follow_the example of your glorious ancestors who confessed their_faith bravely before tyrants , torture , and death . What more ? Does the sect try to enslave the Church and to put it -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of the state as a humble servant ? You must then demand and claim for it the freedom and independence due it before the law . Does masonry seek to tear apart Catholic unity , sowing discord even in the clergy itself , arousing quarrels , fomenting strife , and inciting insubordination , revolt , and schism ? By tightening the sacred bond of charity and obedience , you can thwart its plans , bring to naught its efforts , and disappoint its hopes . Be all of one heart and one mind , like the first Christians . Gathered around_the See of Peter and united to your pastors , protect the supreme interests of church and papacy , which_are just as much the supreme interests of Italy and of all the Christian world . The Apostolic See has_always_been the inspirer and jealous guardian of Italian glory . Therefore , be Italians and Catholics , free and non sectarian , faithful to the nation as well as to Christ and His visible Vicar . An anti Christian and antipapal Italy would truly be opposed to the divine plan , and thus condemned to perish . Beloved children , faith and state speak to you -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time through Us . Listen to their cry , arise together and fight manfully the battles of the Lord . May the number , boldness , and strength of the enemy not frighten you , because God -isaia- stronger than they ; if God -isaia- for you , who_can be against you ? . Redouble your prayers so that God might be with you in a greater abundance of grace , fighting and triumphing with you . Accompany your prayers with the practice of the Christian virtues , especially charity toward_the needy . Seek God s mercies with humility and perseverance , renewing every_day the promises of your baptism . As a pledge of these_things and as a sign of Our paternal love , We bestow on you Our apostolic_blessing , beloved_children .
