The mightiest helper of the Christian people , and the most merciful , -isaia- the Virgin Mother of God . How fitting it -isaia- to accord her honors ever_increasing in splendor , and call_upon her aid with a confidence daily growing more ardent . The abundant blessings , infinitely varied and constantly multiplying , which flow from her all over the whole_world for the common benefit of mankind , add fresh motives for invoking and honoring her . Catholic Devotedness to Mary . For such magnanimous favors , Catholics on their_part have_not failed to return to her the tender devotion of grateful hearts ; because , if ever there_was a time_when love and veneration of the Blessed Virgin were awakened to new_life and inflaming every class of society , it -isaia- in these_days so bitterly anti religious . The clearest evidence of this_fact lies in the sodalities which_have everywhere been restored and multiplied under her patronage ; in the magnificent temples erected to her august name ; in the pilgrimages undertaken by throngs of devout souls to her most venerated shrines ; in the congresses whose deliberations are devoted to the increase of her glory ; in other_things of a like nature which_are praiseworthy in themselves and augur well for the future . Widespread Devotion to the Rosary . It -isaia- specially deserving of notice , and it gives Us the greatest pleasure to recall , that of all the forms of devotion to the Blessed Virgin , that_most excellent method of prayer , Mary s Rosary , -isaia- establishing itself most widely in popular esteem and practice . This , We repeat , -isaia- a source of great joy to Us . If We have spent so large a share of our activities in promoting the Rosary devotion , We can easily see with what benevolence the Queen of Heaven has come to Our aid when We prayed to her ; and We express the confident conviction_that she will_continue to stand -atti_degli_apostoli- Our side to lighten the burdens and the afflictions which_the days to come will_bring . The Extension of the Kingdom of Christ . It -isaia- mainly to expand the kingdom of Christ that We look to the Rosary for the most effective help . On many occasions We have declared that the object which -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time engrosses Our most earnest attention , -isaia- the reconciliation to the Church of nations which have_become separated_from her . We recognize , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , that the realization of Our hopes must be sought chiefly in prayer and supplication addressed to almighty God . This conviction We again affirmed not long ago , when We recommended that special prayers be offered for_this intention to the Holy Ghost during the solemnities of Pentecost ; a recommendation that_was adopted everywhere with the greatest good_will . But in view of the importance and the difficulty of such an undertaking , and the necessity of perseverance in the practice of any virtue , it -isaia- well to recall_the Apostle s apt counsel : '' Be instant in prayer '' counsel all the more to the point because an auspicious beginning of the enterprise will supply the best inducement to perseverance in prayer . Next October , therefore , if you and your_people devoutly spend the whole month with Us in praying assiduously to the Virgin Mother of God through_her Rosary and the other customary devotions , nothing could do more to further this project or be more pleasing to Us . We have_the best reasons for entrusting Our plans and Our aspirations to her protection and the highest hopes of seeing them realized . Jesus Gave Mary to His Church . The mystery of Christ s immense love for us -isaia-_revealed with dazzling brilliance in the fact_that the dying Saviour bequeathed His Mother to His disciple John in the memorable testament : '' Behold thy son . '' Now in John , as the Church has constantly taught , Christ designated the whole_human_race , and in the first rank are they_who are joined with Him by faith . It -isaia- in this sense_that St . Anselm of Canterbury says : '' What dignity , O Virgin , could be more highly prized than to be the Mother of those_to_whom Christ deigned to be Father and Brother ! '' With a generous heart Mary undertook and discharged the duties of her high but laborious office , the beginnings of which_were consecrated in the Cenacle . With wonderful care she nurtured the first Christians by her holy example , her authoritative counsel , her sweet consolation , her fruitful prayers . She was , in very truth , the Mother of the Church , the Teacher and Queen of the Apostles , to whom , besides , she confided no small part of the divine mysteries which_she kept in her_heart . It -isaia- impossible to measure the power and scope of her offices since_the day she_was taken up to that height of heavenly glory in the company of her Son , to which_the dignity and luster of her merits entitle her . From her heavenly abode she began , by God s decree , to watch over the Church , to assist and befriend us as our Mother ; so that_she who_was so intimately associated_with the mystery of human salvation -isaia- just as closely associated_with the distribution of the graces which for all time will flow from the Redemption . Mary , Help of Christians . The power thus put into her hands -isaia- all but unlimited . How unerringly right , then , are Christian souls when_they turn to Mary for help as though impelled by an instinct of nature , confidently sharing with_her their future hopes and past achievements , their sorrows and joys , commending themselves like children to the care of a bountiful mother . How rightly , too , has every nation and every liturgy without exception acclaimed her great renown , which_has grown greater with the voice of each succeeding century . Among her many_other titles we find her hailed as '' our Lady , our Mediatrix , '' '' the Reparatrix of the whole_world , '' '' the Dispenser of all heavenly_gifts . '' Mary and Our Faith . Since faith_-isaia- the foundation , the source , of the gifts of God by which man_-isaia- raised above the order of nature and -isaia- endowed_with the dispositions requisite for life eternal , we are in justice bound to recognize_the hidden influence of Mary in obtaining the gift of faith and its salutary cultivation of Mary who brought the '' author of faith '' into this_world and who , because of her_own great faith , was called '' blessed . '' '' O Virgin most_holy , none abounds in the knowledge of God except through thee ; none , O Mother of God , attains salvation except through thee ; none receives a gift from the throne of mercy except through thee . It -isaia- no exaggeration to say that_it_-isaia- due chiefly to her leadership and help that the wisdom and teachings of the Gospel spread so rapidly to all the nations of the world in spite of the most obstinate difficulties and most cruel persecutions , and brought everywhere in their train a new reign of justice_and_peace . This it was that stirred the soul of St . Cyril of Alexandria to the following prayerful address to the Blessed Virgin : '' Through you the Apostles have preached salvation to the nations . through you the priceless Cross -isaia- everywhere honored and venerated ; through you the demons have_been put to rout and mankind has_been summoned back to Heaven ; through you every misguided creature held in the thrall of idols -isaia- led to recognize_the truth ; through you have_the faithful been brought to the layer of holy Baptism and churches been founded among every people . '' Ever the Protectress of Catholic Belief . Nay she_has even , as this_same Doctor claims , upheld and given strength to the '' sceptre of the orthodox faith . '' It has_been her unremitting concern to see_to_it_that the Catholic Faith stands firmly lodged in the midst of the people , there to thrive in its fertile and undivided unity . Many and well_known are the proofs of her solicitude , manifested from time to time even in a miraculous manner . In the times and places in which , to the Church s grief , faith languished in lethargic indifference or was tormented by the baneful scourge of heresy , our great and gracious Lady in her kindness was ever ready with_her aid and comfort . Under her inspiration , strong with_her might , great men were raised up illustrious for their sanctity no less_than for their apostolic spirit to beat off the attacks of wicked adversaries and to lead souls back into the virtuous ways of Christian life , firing them_with a consuming love of the things of God . One such man , an army in himself , was Dominic Guzman . Putting all his trust in our Lady s Rosary , he set himself fearlessly to the accomplishment of both these tasks with happy results . No one will fail to remark how_much the merits of the venerable Fathers and Doctors of the Church , who spent their_lives in the defense and explanation of the Catholic Faith , redound to the Virgin Mother of God . For from her , the Seat of Divine Wisdom , as they_themselves gratefully tell us , a strong current of the most sublime wisdom has coursed through_their writings . And they_were quick to acknowledge that_not by themselves but by her have iniquitous errors been overcome . Finally , princes as well as Pontiffs , the guardians and defenders of the faith the former by waging holy wars , the latter by the solemn decrees which_they_have issued have_not hesitated to call_upon the name of the Mother of our God , and have found her answer powerful and propitious . Hence it -isaia- that the Church and the Fathers have_given expression to their joy in Mary in words whose beauty equals their truth : '' Hail , voice of the Apostles forever eloquent , solid foundation of the faith , unshakeable prop of the Church . '' '' Hail , thou through whom we have_been enrolled as citizens of the One , Holy , Catholic and Apostolic Church '' . '' Hail , thou fountain springing forth by God s design , whose rivers flowing over in pure and unsullied waves of orthodoxy put to flight the hosts of error . '' '' Rejoice , because thou alone bast destroyed all the heresies in the world . '' A Mother to the Nations . The unexampled part which_the Virgin most admirably played and still plays in the progress , the battles , and the triumphs of the Catholic Faith , makes it evident what God has planned for_her to do . It should fill the hearts of all good people_with a firm hope of obtaining those things_which are_now the object of our_common desire . Trust Mary , implore her aid . That the one selfsame profession_of_faith may unite the minds of Christian nations in peace and harmony , that the one and only bond of perfect charity may gather their_hearts within its embrace such_-isaia- our prayerful hope ! And may Mary , by her powerful help , bring this ardently desired gift into_our possession ! And remembering that her only_begotten Son prayed so earnestly to His heavenly Father for the closest union among the nations whom He has called by the one Baptism to the one inheritance of salvation bought for an infinite price , will she not , for that_reason , see_to_it_that all in His marvellous light will strive as with one mind for_unity ? And will it not be her wish to employ her goodness and providence to console the Spouse of Christ , the Church , through_her long sustained efforts in this enterprise , as well as to bring to full perfection the boon of unity among the members of the Christian family , which_-isaia- the illustrious fruit of her motherhood ? Beloved Bond of Christendom . A token that the fulfillment of these hopes may soon be a reality -isaia- to be seen in the conviction and the confidence which warms the hearts of the devout . Mary will be the happy bond to draw together , with strong yet gentle constraint , all who love Christ , no matter where_they may be , to form a nation of brothers yielding obedience to the Vicar of Christ on earth , the Roman Pontiff , their common Father . Here our_mind , almost of its_own accord , looks back through the annals of the Church to the illustrious examples of her ancient unity , and dwells with affectionate regard on the memory of the great Council of Ephesus . The absolute unity of faith , the participation in identical worship , which in those days linked East with West , manifested itself in the Council with a strength unparalleled , and shone beyond it with a radiant beauty when , after_the Fathers had emphasized the dogma that the Blessed Virgin -isaia- the Mother of God , the news of their procedure spread abroad from the exultant populace of that_most devout of cities filled all Christendom with transports of universal joy . Our Catholic Love of Unity . Every motive which bolsters and increases confidence in the power of our mighty and kindhearted Virgin Mother to obtain the things we ask for , should act as a powerful incentive generating in us that fiery zeal to pray to her a zeal We would incite in every Catholic heart . Let each_one weigh for_himself , moreover , how fitting -isaia- this practice and how fruitful to himself ; and how acceptable and pleasing to the Blessed Virgin it -isaia- bound to be . For , possessing as they do unity of faith , Catholics thus make clear not_only that_they value this precious gift -atti_degli_apostoli- its true worth , but also_that they intend to hold to it with jealous tenacity . No better way -isaia- afforded of proving a fraternal feeling toward their separated brethren than to aid them by every_means within their_power to recover this , the greatest of all gifts . Mother of Unity and Concord . Such brotherly affection , truly Christian and practiced as long as the Church can remember , has traditionally sought a special efficacy from the Mother of God , since she_has been_the foremost promoter of peace and unity . Germain of Constantinople addresses this_prayer to her : '' Be mindful of Christians who_are thy servants ; commend the prayers of all ; help all to realize their hopes ; strengthen the faith ; keep the Church in unity . '' And to this_day the Greeks beseech her in this manner : '' O Virgin most pure , whose privilege it -isaia- to approach thy Son without fear of rebuff ! Beseech Him , O Virgin most_holy , to grant peace to the world and to breathe into the churches of Christendom one mind and one heart ; and we shall all magnify thee . '' The Eastern Churches and Mary . There -isaia- another special reason_why Mary will be favorably disposed to grant our united prayers in behalf of the nations cut off from communion with the Church : namely , the prodigious things they have_done for_her honor in the past , especially in the East . To them -isaia- due much of the credit for propagating and increasing devotion to her . From them have come some of the best remembered heralds and champions of her dignity , who_have wielded a mighty influence by their authority or by their writings eulogists famed for the ardor and the charm of their eloquence ; '' empresses well beloved of God , '' who imitated the Virgin most pure in the example of their_lives , and paid honor to her with lavish generosity ; temples and basilicas built to her glory with regal splendor . And We may here add a detail not foreign to Our subject and reflecting further glory upon the Mother of God . It -isaia- common knowledge that , under the changing fortunes of time , great numbers of venerable images of our Lady have_been brought from the East to the West , most of them finding their_way to Italy and to Rome . Our forebears received them_with deepest respect and venerated them_with magnificent honors ; and their descendants , emulating their piety , continue to cherish these images as highly sacred treasures . It -isaia- a delight for the mind to discover in this_fact the approval and the favor of a mother wholly devoted to her_children . For it seems to indicate that_these images have_been left in our midst as witness of the ages when_the entire Christian family was held together by ties of absolute unity , and as so many precious pledges of our_common inheritance . The very sight of them must needs invite souls , as though the Virgin herself were bidding them , to keep in devout remembrance those_whom the Catholic Church calls with loving care back to the peace and the gladness which_they formerly enjoyed , within her embrace . Mary , Guardian of Unity . And so , in Mary , God has_given us the most zealous guardian of Christian unity . There are , of course , more ways than one to win her protection by prayer , but as for Us , We think_that the best and most effective way to her favor lies in the Rosary . We have elsewhere brought it to the attention of the devout Christian and not least among the advantages of the Rosary -isaia- the ready and easy means it puts in his hands to nurture his faith , and to keep him from ignorance of his religion and the danger of error . The very origin of the Rosary makes that plain . When such faith_-isaia- exercised by vocally repeating the Our Father and Hail Mary of the Rosary prayers , or better still in the contemplation of the mysteries , it -isaia- evident how close we are brought to Mary . For every time we devoutly say the Rosary in supplication before her , we are once_more brought face to face with the marvel of our_salvation ; we watch the mysteries of our Redemption as though_they were unfolding before our_eyes ; and as one follows another , Mary stands revealed -atti_degli_apostoli- once as God s Mother and our Mother . The sublimity of that double dignity , the fruits of her twofold ministry , appear in vivid light when in devout meditation we think of Mary s share in the joyful , the sorrowful , the glorious mysteries of her Son . The heart_-isaia- inflamed by these reflections with a feeling of grateful love toward her and , esteeming everything beneath her as so much worthless chaff , strives with manful purpose to prove worthy of such a Mother and the gifts she bestows . Meditation on the mysteries of the Rosary , often repeated in the spirit of faith , cannot help but please her and move her , the fondest of mothers , to show mercy to her_children . For Our Separated Brethren . For that_reason We say that the Rosary -isaia- by far the best prayer by which to plead before her the cause of our separated brethren . To grant a favorable hearing belongs properly to her office of spiritual Mother . For Mary has not brought forth nor could she those_who_are of Christ except in the one same Faith and in the one same love ; for '' Can Christ be divided ? '' All must live the life of Christ in an organic unity in order to '' bring forth fruit to God '' in the one same body . Every one of the multitudes , therefore , whom_the mischief of calamitous events has stolen away from that_unity , must be born again to Christ of that_same Mother whom God has endowed_with a never failing fertility to bring forth a holy people . And this Mary , for_her part , longs to do . Adorned by us with garlands of her favorite prayer , she_will obtain by her entreaties help in abundance from the Spirit that quickeneth . God grant that_they refuse not to comply with the burning desire of their merciful Mother but , on the contrary , give ear , like men_of_good will , with a proper regard_for their eternal_salvation , to the voice , gently persuasive , which calls to them : '' My little children , of whom I -amos- in labor again , until Christ be formed in you . '' Devotion to the Rosary in the East . Knowing what power our Lady s Rosary possesses , not_a_few of Our Predecessors took special_care to spread the devotion throughout_the countries of the East in particular Eugene IV in the Constitution '' Advesperascente '' issued in , and later Innocent XII and Clement XI . By their authority , privileges of wide extent were granted to the Order of Preachers in favor of this project . The hoped for results were forthcoming , thanks to the energetic activity of the brethren of that Order , result to which many a bright record bears_witness , although time and adversity have since raised great obstacles in the way of further progress . Yet even today the same zeal for the Rosary devotion which We cited -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this Letter still fills the hearts of great numbers in those lands a fact which , We trust , will be as useful in the realization of Our hopes as it was in raising them . Along with this hope , there_-isaia- the joyful fact , of equal importance to the East and the West , and in keeping_with_the longing We have expressed : namely the plan , Venerable Brethren , which took form -atti_degli_apostoli- the celebrated Eucharistic Congress held in Jerusalem , to build a shrine in honor of the Queen of the Most Holy Rosary -atti_degli_apostoli- Patras in Achaia , not far from places_where -atti_degli_apostoli- one time Christianity , under her patronage , shone brilliantly . For , as We have with_great pleasure learned from the committee which_was organized with Our approval to advance the project and take charge of the work , most of you have_already sent in contributions collected for this_purpose and have promised to continue your help until the project has_been completed . On the strength of this it has_been decided to begin work on a scale proportioned to the size of the undertaking , and We have granted permission for the laying of the first stone of the shrine -atti_degli_apostoli- an early date with solemn ceremonies . The temple will stand as a monument of everlasting thanksgiving erected in the name of the Christian people to their heavenly Helper and Mother . There she_will be invoked unceasingly in the Greek and the Latin rites that , ever_more propitious , she will_continue to heap new favors upon the ancient blessings . Let All Turn to Mary . And now , Venerable Brethren , Our exhortation returns to the point from which it began . Well may all , shepherds and flocks alike , fly with fullest confidence to the protection of the great Virgin , especially next month . Let them not_fail to call_upon her name , with one voice beseeching her as God s Mother , publicly and in private , by praise , by prayer , by the ardor of their desire : '' Show thyself our Mother . '' May her motherly compassion keep her whole family safe from every danger , lead_them in the path of genuine prosperity , above all establish them in holy unity . She looks upon Catholics of every nation with a kindly eye . Where the bond of charity joins them together she makes them more ready , more_and_more determined , to uphold the honor of religion which , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , brings upon the state the greatest blessings . May she look with utmost compassion upon those great and illustrious nations which_are cut off from the Church and upon the noble souls who have_not forgotten their Christian duty . May she aspire in them most salutary desires , foster their holy aspirations , and bring them to happy completion . In the East , may that widespread devotion to her which_the dissident nations profess , as well as the countless glorious acts of their ancestors in her honor , effectively aid them . In the West , may the memory of her beneficent patronage stand its dissidents in good stead ; with surpassing kindness she_has , through many ages , manifested her approval of , and has rewarded , the admirable devotion shown her among every class . May the peoples of the East and West , and all the others wherever they_may be , profit by the suppliant voice of Catholics united in prayer , and by our voice which_will cry to Our last breath : Show thyself a Mother . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , the fifth day of September , in the eighteenth year of Our Pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .
