Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Blessing . Whoever considers the height of dignity and glory to which God has raised the Most August Virgin Mary , will easily perceive how important it -isaia- , both_for public and for private benefit , that devotion to her should be assiduously practised , and daily promoted more_and_more . Mary s Place in the Incarnation and Redemption . God predestined her from all eternity to be the Mother of the Incarnate Word , and for that_reason so highly distinguished her among all His most beautiful works in the triple order of nature , grace and glory , that the Church justly applies to her these_words : '' I came out of the mouth of the Most High , the first born before all creatures '' Ecclus . And when , in the first ages , the parents of mankind fell into sin , involving their posterity in the same ruin , she_was set up as a pledge of the restoration of peace and salvation . The Only begotten Son of God ever paid to His Most Holy Mother indubitable marks of honour . During His private life on earth He associated her with Himself in each of His first two miracles : the miracle of grace , when , -atti_degli_apostoli- the salutation of Mary , the infant leaped in the womb of Elizabeth ; the miracle of nature , when He turned water into wine -atti_degli_apostoli- the marriage feast of Cana . And , -atti_degli_apostoli- the supreme moment of His public_life , when sealing the New Testament in His precious Blood , He committed her to his beloved Apostle in those sweet words , '' Behold , thy Mother ! '' John xix . We Must Follow Christ s Example . We , therefore , who , though unworthy , hold the place of Vicar of Christ upon earth , shall never cease to promote the glory of so great a Mother , as long as life endures . And since , as old age draws on apace , We feel_that life cannot now last much longer , We are constrained to repeat to each and all of our beloved_children in Christ those last words of His upon the Cross , left to us as a testament , '' Behold , thy Mother ! '' Greatly rewarded indeed shall We be , if Our exhortations succeed in making even one of the faithful hold nothing dearer than devotion to Mary ; so that_those words_which St . John wrote about himself may be applied to each , '' the disciple took her to his_own '' Ibid . As the month of October again approaches , Venerable Brethren , We would_not willingly leave you without Our letters this_year , also once_more urging you with all possible earnestness to strive by the recitation of the Rosary to aid both yourselves individually , and the Church in her need . This form of prayer appears , under_the_guidance of Divine Providence , to have_been wonderfully developed -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the century , for the purpose of stimulating the lagging piety of the faithful . This -isaia- witnessed by the splendid churches and much frequented sanctuaries of the Mother of God . To this Divine Mother we have offered the flowers of the month of May ; to her we would_have also fruit bearing October dedicated with especial tenderness of devotion . It -isaia- fitting_that both parts of the year should be consecrated to her who said : '' My flowers are the fruit of honour and riches '' Ecclus . Modern Tendency to Association . The natural tendency of man to association has_never been stronger , or more earnestly and generally followed , than in our_own age . This -isaia- not -atti_degli_apostoli- all to be reprehended , unless when so excellent a natural tendency -isaia- perverted to evil purposes , and wicked men , banding together in various_forms of societies , conspire '' against the Lord and against His Christ '' Ps ii . It -isaia- , however , most gratifying to observe that pious associations are becoming more_and_more popular among Catholics also . They are frequently formed ; indeed , all Catholics are so closely drawn '' together and united by the bonds of charity , as members of one household , that_they both may be and are truly styled brethren . But if the charity of Christ be absent , none may glory in the name and fellowship of brethren . So wrote Tertullian long ago in pungent words : '' We are your brethren by right of a common mother , nature , yet are ye less_than men , because unnatural brothers . How much_more justly are they called and esteemed as brethren who acknowledge one_and_the_same Father , God ; who_have drunk in one_and_the_same spirit of charity ; who_have_been borne from one_and_the_same womb of ignorance into the one light of truth ? '' Apolog . Usefulness of Catholic Associations . There are_many reasons for Catholics joining useful associations of this_kind . We include in these clubs , popular savings banks , recreative classes , associations for the care of youth , sodalities , and many_other organizations for excellent purposes . All these , though from their name , constitution , and special ends , apparently of modern invention , are in reality of great antiquity . Traces of societies of this_kind are to be found even in the earliest ages of Christianity . In later ages they_were legally approved , distinguished by special emblems , enriched with privileges , associated_with divine_worship in the Churches , or devoted to works of spiritual or corporal mercy , and -atti_degli_apostoli- different epochs known under different names . Their numbers increased to such an extent , especially in Italy , that no city or town , nay scarcely any parish , was without one or more of them . The Rosary Sodality : Its Excellence . We do not_hesitate to assign a pre eminent place among_these societies to that known as the Society of the Holy Rosary . If we regard its origin , we find it distinguished by its antiquity , for St . Dominic himself_-isaia- said to have_been its founder . If we estimate its privileges , we see it enriched with a vast number of them granted by the munificence of our_predecessors . The form of the association , its_very soul , -isaia- the Rosary of Our Lady , of the excellence of which We have elsewhere spoken -atti_degli_apostoli- length . Still the virtue and efficacy of the Rosary appear all the greater when considered as the special office of the Sodality which bears its name . Everyone knows how necessary prayer_-isaia- for all men ; not_that God s decrees can be changed , but , as St . Gregory says , '' that_men by asking may merit to receive what Almighty God bath decreed from eternity to grant them '' Dialog . Augustine says , '' He who knoweth how to pray aright , knoweth how to live aright '' In Ps . But prayers acquire their greatest efficacy in obtaining God s assistance when offered publicly , by large numbers , constantly , and unanimously , so as to form as it were a single chorus of supplication ; as those words of the Acts of the Apostles clearly declare wherein the disciples of Christ , awaiting the coming of the Holy Ghost , are said to have_been '' persevering with one mind in prayer '' Acts i . Those who practise this manner of prayer will_never fail to obtain certain fruit . Such -isaia- certainly the case with members of the Rosary Sodality . Just as by the recitation of the Divine Office , priests offer a public , constant , and most efficacious supplication ; so the supplication offered by the members of this Sodality in the recitation of the Rosary , or '' Psalter of Our Lady , '' as it has_been styled by some of the Popes , -isaia-_also in a way public , constant , and universal . Special Efficacy of Public Prayer . Since , as We have_said , public prayers are much_more excellent and more efficacious than private ones , so ecclesiastical writers have_given to the Rosary Sodality the title of '' the army of prayer , enrolled by St . Dominic , under the banner of the Mother of God , '' of her , whom sacred literature and the history of the Church salute as the conqueror of the Evil One and of all errors . The Rosary unites together all who join the Sodality in a common bond of paternal or military comradeship ; so that a mighty host -isaia- thereby formed , duly marshalled and arrayed , to repel the assaults of the enemy , both from within and without . Wherefore may the members of this pious society take to themselves the words of St . Cyprian : '' Our prayer_-isaia- public and in common ; and when we pray , we pray not_for one , but_for the whole_people , for we , the entire people , are_one '' De Orat . The history of the Church bears testimony to the power and efficacy of this form of prayer , recording as it does the rout of the Turkish forces -atti_degli_apostoli- the naval battle of Lepanto , and the victories gained over the same in the last century -atti_degli_apostoli- Temesvar in Hungary and in the island of Corfu . Our predecessor , Gregory XIII , in order to perpetuate the memory of the first named victory , established the feast of Our Lady of Victories , which later on Clement XI distinguished by the title of Rosary Sunday and commanded to be celebrated throughout_the universal Church . Difference Between Prayer to God and to the Saints : An Objection Answered . From the fact_that this warfare of prayer_-isaia- '' enrolled under the name of the Mother of God , '' fresh efficacy and fresh honour are thereby added to it . Hence the frequent repetition in the Rosary of the '' Hail Mary '' after each '' Our Father . '' So far from this derogating in any_way from the honour due to God , as though it indicated that we placed greater confidence in Mary s patronage than in God s power , it -isaia- rather this which especially moves God , and wins His mercy for us . We are taught by the Catholic faith that_we_may pray not_only to God himself , but_also to the Blessed in heaven Conc . , though in different manner ; because we ask from God as from the Source of all good , but_from the Saints as from intercessors . Thomas , '' -isaia- offered to a person in two ways one as though to be granted by himself ; another , as to be obtained through_him . In the first way we pray to God alone , because all our prayers ought to be directed to obtaining grace and glory , which God alone gives , according to those words of Psalm lxxxiii . , , '' The Lord will_give grace and glory . '' But in the second way we pray to holy angels and men , not_that God may learn our petition through them , but_that by their prayers and merits our prayers may be efficacious . Wherefore , it -isaia- said in the Apocalypse viii . , : '' The smoke of the incense of the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God from the hand of the angel '' Summa Theol . Now , of all the blessed in heaven , who_can compare with the august Mother of God in obtaining grace ? Who seeth more_clearly in the Eternal Word what troubles oppress us , what_are our needs ? Who -isaia- allowed more power in moving God ? Who can compare with_her in maternal affection ? We do not pray to the Blessed in the same_way as to God ; for we ask the Holy Trinity to have mercy on us , but we ask all the Saints to pray_for us Ibid . Yet our manner of praying to the Blessed Virgin has something in common with_our worship of God , so that the Church even addresses to her the words with_which we pray to God : '' Have mercy on sinners . '' The members of the Rosary Sodality , therefore , do exceedingly well in weaving together , as in a crown , so many salutations and prayers to Mary . For , so great -isaia- her dignity , so great her favour before God , that whosoever in his need will_not have_recourse to her -isaia- trying to fly without wings . Union of Prayer and Work with the Angels . We must_not omit to mention another excellence of this Sodality . As often as , in reciting the Rosary , we meditate upon the mysteries of our Redemption , so often do we in a manner emulate the sacred duties once committed to the Angelic hosts . The Angels revealed each of these mysteries in its due time ; they played a great part in them ; they_were constantly present -atti_degli_apostoli- them , with countenances indicative now of joy , now of sorrow , now of triumphant exultation . Gabriel was sent to announce the Incarnation of the Eternal Word to the Virgin . In the cave of Bethlehem , Angels sang the glory of the new born Saviour . The Angel gave Joseph command to fly with the Child into Egypt . An Angel consoled , with_his loving words , Jesus in His bloody sweat in the garden . Angels announced His resurrection , after He had triumphed over death , to the women . Angels carried Him up into Heaven ; and foretold His second coming , surrounded by Angelic hosts , unto whom He will associate the souls of the elect , and carry them aloft with Him to the heavenly choirs , '' above whom_the Holy Mother of God -isaia- exalted . '' To those , therefore , who make_use of the pious prayers of the Rosary in this Sodality , may be well applied the words with_which St . Paul addressed the new Christians : '' You are come to Mount Sion , and to the city of the living God , the Heavenly Jerusalem , and to the company of many thousands of Angels '' Heb . What more divine , what more delightful , than to meditate and pray with the Angels ? With what confidence may we not hope that_those_who on earth have united with the Angels in this ministry will one_day enjoy their blessed company in Heaven ? The Popes and the Rosary Sodality . For these reasons the Roman Pontiffs have ever given the highest praise to this Sodality of Our Lady . calls it '' a most devout confraternity '' Splendor Paternae Gloriae , Feb . declares that by its virtue '' Christians began suddenly to be transformed into other men , the darkness of heresy to be dispelled , and the light of Catholic faith to shine_forth '' Consueverunt Romani Pontifices , September , . Sixtus V , noting how fruitful for religion this Sodality was , professed himself most devoted to it . Many others , too , enriched it with numerous and very_special indulgences , or took it under their particular patronage , enrolling themselves in it and giving it many testimonies of their goodwill . We also , Venerable Brethren , moved by the example of Our predecessors , earnestly exhort and conjure you , as We have so often done , to devote special_care to this sacredwarfare , so that by your efforts fresh forces may be daily enrolled on everyside . Through you and those of your_clergy who_have care of souls , let thepeople know and duly appreciate the efficacy of this Sodality and its usefulnessfor man s salvation . This We beg all the more earnestly as of late thatbeautiful devotion to our Blessed Mother , called '' the living Rosary , '' has once_more become popular . We have gladly blessed this_devotion , and Weearnestly desire_that you would sedulously and strenuously encourage its growth . We cherish the strongest hope that_these prayers and praises , rising incessantlyfrom the lips and hearts of so great a multitude , will be most efficacious . Alternately rising by night and by day , throughout_the different countries ofthe earth , they combine a harmony of vocal prayer with meditation upon thedivine mysteries . In ages long past this perennial stream of praise and prayerwas foretold in those inspired words with_which Ozias in his song addressedJudith : '' Blessed art thou , O daughter , by the Lord , the Most High God , above all women upon the earth . because He bath so magnified thy name thisday that thy praise shall_not depart out of the mouth of man . '' And all thepeople of Israel acclaimed him in these_words : '' So be it , so be it ! '' Judith xiii . Meanwhile , as a pledge of heavenly blessings , and a testimony of Our paternal affection , We lovingly impart to You , in the name of the Lord , Venerable Brethren , and to all the clergy_and_people committed to your faithful care , the Apostolic Benediction .
