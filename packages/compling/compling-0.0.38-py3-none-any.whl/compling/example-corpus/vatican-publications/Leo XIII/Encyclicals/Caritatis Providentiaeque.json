From time to time We have sent the bishops of other Catholic nations individual letters as tokens of Our love and providence ; We have long desired to find an opportunity to do the same for you . Indeed We cherish you , a people_who differ in nationality , speech , and religious rite , with the same zeal , as We have demonstrated -atti_degli_apostoli- other times . The thought of you reminds Us of your distinguished deeds and your devotion and confidence in Us . Your fathers deserve exceptional praise . When all of Europe was trembling with fear -atti_degli_apostoli- the attacks of the powerful enemies of the Christian name , your fathers were_the first to offer their_lives in remarkable defensive battles , as they guarded the civil and religious order . Only a few months ago We publicly commemorated their merits . This was when a number of you led a group of the faithful in pilgrimage to greet Us and congratulate Us . At this beautiful testimony of faith , We had the delightful opportunity to congratulate the Polish nation on the glory of their ancestral faith_,_which lives vigorously despite so many and such difficult trials . We send this_letter now so that a declaration of Our solicitude for you may_become known to the Church and so that_your labors for the Catholic faith may be encouraged to continue . We know what zealous interpreters of Our will and devoted servants you_are . Further , We know_how determined you_are to safeguard and increase your flock . May God grant the fruits We desire in this_matter since He has prompted Us to speak . The blessings of divine truth and grace , which Christ brought to the human_race by His religion , are so excellent and useful that it cannot be compared , much less equated , with any_other . The excellence of its blessings -isaia- manifold and wholesome . In a wonderful manner it inundates both individuals and nations , and both domestic and civil_society , promoting prosperity in this passing life and the acquisition of immortal life . It immediately follows from this_that nations blessed with the gift of the Catholic religion are_bound by the greatest of all obligations to love and cherish it , since_they have_received the greatest of all blessings . At the same_time it -isaia- evident that_this_-isaia- not a matter which each_person or each state can submit to its_own judgment . The divine Author of religion has defined and commanded how and by what discipline this_must be done , namely under the leadership and guidance of the Catholic Church . He established this Church as the pillar and mainstay of the truth_which by His singular help has flourished through all ages and will_continue to flourish always , according to His promise , Lo , I -amos- with you always , even to the close of the age . Ancestors Adherence to Religion . The illustrious respect_for religion you inherited from your ancestors and elders remained stable because your nation has_always adhered to the Church with the firmest faith and because it remained obedient to the Roman Pontiffs and to their bishops . Be grateful for the many benefits and advantages , including comfort and help , you have_received until now . The advantages of regarding the Church highly are obvious , as are the consequences of condemning it . The teachings and laws of the Gospel advance the salvation and perfection of man both in faith and knowledge , as well as in practice and conduct of life . By the divine_law of Christ , the Church can hand down and consecrate that doctrine and law ; for that_reason , she_has great power to guide human_society in which_she promotes noble virtues and produces the choicest blessings . Precepts and Regulations . But the Church -isaia- so far removed from appropriating to herself by the great extent of her authority anything of another s rights or of winking -atti_degli_apostoli- devious means , that_she often indulgently cedes her_own rights . In her wise equity she shows herself to all , both the highly placed and the lowly , as a kind governess and a solicitous mother . Therefore those men act unjustly in this_matter who strive to revive against her old calumnies , so often refuted and entirely worn out , making of them a new kind of reproach . Nor are_those less blameworthy who mistrust the Church for the same reason and kindle suspicion against her among the governors of states and among the legislators , from whom she truly deserves much praise and thanksgiving . For she teaches and commands nothing -atti_degli_apostoli- all that could in any_way impede or oppose the majesty of princes or the safety and progress of the people . Rather she diligently proposes many things from Christian wisdom that_are conducive to their common advantage . Among those worthy of mention are : that persons_who hold the supreme power are considered likenesses of the divine power and providence ; that_their rule must be just and tempered with paternal goodness in imitation of the divine and that it ought to look solely to the benefit of the state ; that sometime they shall_have to render an account to God the Judge , and this_will be the more severe in proportion to the greater dignity of their office ; also that_those subject to authority ought always to reverence and trust their princes and obey them_not only_because of wrath but_also_for conscience sake since God exercises His rule by means of men ; that the subjects also ought to make supplications , prayers , intercessions and thanksgivings for their rulers ; that_they ought to submit to the holy discipline of the state , abstain from the societies and machinations of the wicked and do nothing seditious ; that_they ought to devote_themselves to the maintenance of a tranquil peace in justice . Where these and other Evangelical precepts and regulations which_the Church promotes are valued and actually in force , they never cease to bring forth excellent fruits . These fruits are_more plentiful in those nations in which_the Church exercises more freely the prerogatives of her office . But to oppose those precepts and refuse the leadership of the Church -isaia-_the_same as to oppose the divine will and to reject a remarkable blessing . Then nothing truly favorable and good remains in the city ; everything collapses and fear of calamity haunts both rulers and ruled . Indeed We had_already written to you -atti_degli_apostoli- length on these topics , but We thought it good to recall them so that_you_may strive more vigorously and successfully . It will certainly be advantageous for your flocks if the spirit of turbulent men daring to overturn temporal powers -isaia- guarded against , if the duties of good citizens are_not ignored , and if from faith in God , faith in the state and its leaders may blossom . Parents Obligation for Educating Their Children . Increase your diligence concerning domestic society , the education of youths and of priests , and the best manner of teaching Christian love . The soundness and honor of domestic life , from which health flows into the veins of civil_society , must be sought first in the sanctity of marriage , which_-isaia- indivisible when entered into according to the precepts of God and of the Church . In the next place it -isaia- necessary_that the rights_and_duties between_the spouses be inviolate and , as far_as_possible , supported by the greatest possible love and harmony . Parents must provide protection and advantages for their_children , especially education . The best and most efficacious example for the children -isaia- the lives of their_parents . Parents must realize that_they_can provide_for their education properly and well only by exercising great vigilance . In choosing schools and colleges , they_must avoid not_only those where errors concerning religion are deliberately interspersed with the teaching , or where impiety reigns , but_also those_that consider Christian culture and morals inappropriate for instruction and offer no courses in them . For those , surely , whose talents are developed by letters and the arts also need to be taught the knowledge of and reverence for divine things . Nature itself admonishes that_they must serve God even_more than the state ; in serving the state , they_must direct their steps toward their permanent homeland in heaven . They must keep this goal in mind as they grow older and advance in civil culture both because youths today are urged to a greater desire_for knowledge , and because_they_are exposed daily to great dangers to their_faith . The great losses we have suffered prove this . Now concerning the manner of teaching sacred doctrine , concerning the worthiness and knowledge of professors , and concerning the selection of books , the Church reserves her right to prescribe certain things . Nor can she fail to do so since she_-isaia- bound by a most serious duty to see_to_it_that nothing harmful to the well_being of the faith creeps in and injures the Christian people . The lessons which_are taught in churches and meeting places advocating that the seeds of faith and love be nourished and grow should complement and strengthen the sacred instruction which_-isaia- given in the schools . All these_things indicate that exceptional diligence -isaia- needed in the education of clerics for according to the word of God , they_are '' the salt of the earth and the Light of the world . Every praiseworthy quality which_-isaia- joined to sound doctrine and holiness of life ought to be carefully nurtured in the young clergy and -isaia- no less necessary_for the older clergy who labor for the equipment of the saints for the work of ministry , for building up the body of Christ . We know_that in the seminaries your labors are_not lacking . So rather_than offer admonition , it -isaia- fitting to commend you and all those in whose work of teaching and administration the seminaries rejoice . Surely in times which_are so difficult for the Church , when_the enemies of truth grow strong , when_the pestilence of corruption no longer creeps in the dark but impudently parades everywhere , more remedies are required than before ; these must come from the clergy in the form of greater effort in the good fight for faith and virtue . In the matter of directing studies , We have repeatedly given directives with_regard to philosophical , theological , and biblical studies . Insist that professors conform to them , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time do not let_them neglect any of the other important teachings . Also insist that_those_who are charged with order and piety they_must be men outstanding for their integrity and prudence so moderate the discipline of common life and so develop and exercise the spirits of the students that_their progress in the appropriate virtues becomes daily more apparent . Under this head also comes the prudence they_must learn concerning matters relevant to the civil_power . Surely in this manner a new militia will come forth_from the schools as if from an athletic arena or a fortress ; it will be well equipped to aid those laboring in the dust and heat and to replace those_who_are worn out and aged . You can easily see_that virtue -isaia- exposed to much danger in the performance of the holy ministry and that_it_-isaia- human to grow slack in work and to give up . Therefore offer your priests opportunities to recall and increase their knowledge by study , especially so that , with their_spiritual strength renewed , they_can more zealously devote their time to their_own perfection and bring_about the eternal_salvation of others . Venerable Brethren , when_you have such a clergy , you will realize_that your pastoral burden will not_only be lightened , but will abound in the desired fruit for the flock . We may hope_for an abundance of both from the example and active love of the clergy . This same precept of love , great in Christ , -isaia- commended to all clergy ; each one_-isaia- to endeavor to perfect it , as John the Apostle admonishes , in deed and truth . By no other bond or means can families and cities stand firm and , what_-isaia- more , attain Christian dignity . Considering this_matter and deploring the many evils which arise both in public_and_private life whenever this precept -isaia- made of little account and neglected , We have often raised Our Apostolic voice in this_regard , particularly in the encyclical_letter Rerum novarum . In it We listed the principles apt to ameliorate the condition of the workers according to evangelical truth and justice . We now reiterate them and renew Our admonition . How much force and influence Catholic institutions , unions of workers , mutual aid societies , and many_other groups of this nature , have when motivated by holy love , both to relieve the hardships of the poor and to properly inform a weak populace , -isaia- obvious from experience . All who contribute their counsel , their authority , their money , or their labors to these groups , on which_the salvation temporal and eternal of many depends , certainly have earned a reward both from religion and from their compatriots . Further Advice to the Polish People . In addition to the above remarks to all the Polish people , We desire to add certain things_which We think will be useful to particular places in Poland . In this_way We shall fix certain of the warnings We have_already given more firmly in your minds . First to those great numbers of you who_live under Russian rule : it -isaia- right that We praise you and strengthen you with an exhortation to retain and steadfastly nourish the spirit of constancy in professing the Catholic faith . In it you have_the source and fountain , as We have_said , of the greatest blessings . To value this above all other_things -isaia- certainly necessary_for a Christian . Commanded by divine_law and illumined by the example of holy men , he never deserts this , no matter what_the obstacles . He guards it with all his strength . Relying on its strength , he confidently and patiently expects consolation and aid from God , no matter what events the human condition may bring . Past Papal Support for Poland . Your great confidence in Us , like that of sons , pleases Us very much . Therefore We call to your attention the deceitful trickery which_has_been evily spread about concerning Our benevolence and solicitude for you . Be convinced of this : We have_not done less_than Our predecessors , not_only_for your compatriots but_also_for you . Indeed to support your confidence , We are prepared both to exert a tremendous effort in all things and to pursue them confidently . It -isaia- useful to recall that_from the very_beginning of Our pontificate , We , always thinking about the relief of the Catholic cause among your_people , brought it to the attention of the Imperial Council so that We might fight for those things_which the dignity of the Apostolic See and the defense of your interests seemed to require . As a result of these efforts , We obtained certain agreements in the year . Among these -isaia- the freedom to govern seminaries according to the rules of canon_law ; another stipulates that the ecclesiastical academy of Petersburg , which_-isaia- open to Polish students , be given over entirely to the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Mohilev and be expanded for the greater advantage of the clergy and the Catholic religion . We also received assurance that the laws which your_clergy complained were too severe would either be repealed or softened as soon as possible . From that_time on , We seized every opportunity to defend those agreements . In fact it pleased Us even to bring these demands to the attention of the emperor himself , who_-isaia- friendly to Us and whose high regard for_justice in your cause We can eagerly testify to . Nor shall We omit prayers for him for the king s heart_-isaia- in the hand of the Lord . Continue to safeguard with Us the dignity and the holy rights of the Catholic religion . For only_when in possession of just security and liberty -isaia- it equipped with the appropriate aids for accomplishing its work as it should . Then it -isaia- able to stand firm according to its_proper purpose and to produce the blessings which it ought . Since you yourselves perceive the kind of labor We have_given to obtain and preserve the tranquility of public order among nations , never cease to work so that the respect_for higher authority and the obedience in public discipline of both the clergy and laity may remain firm . Then all causes of offense or criticism will be removed , every accusation will be changed into reverence , and the praise of the Catholic name will remain and increase . It -isaia-_also your duty to see_to_it_that nothing_-isaia- lacking for the eternal_salvation of the faithful , either in the administration of ecclesiastical law or in the preaching of the divine work or in nourishing the spirit of religion . Also see_to_it_that children and adolescents are taught sacred catechism especially in the schools , and let that instruction be given , whenever possible , by priests . Further , let_the beauty of sacred buildings and the respect_for religious festivals be suitable to pious worship . From these_things the faith draws a healthy increase . You will have_done well indeed if you forestall danger should it appear to be imminent in these_matters . For this_reason do not_hesitate to appeal to the agreements which_were made with the Apostolic See . Certainly the absence of such difficulties and the presence of real concord should be desirable and pleasing not_only to the Polish people , but to all who_are guided by a sincere love of the state . For , as We said in the beginning , the Catholic Church -isaia- so constituted as never to bring forth anything -atti_degli_apostoli- all harmful to peoples and to states , but_only benefits , even in temporal matters . Now for you who_are subject to the house of Hapsburg . Diligently recall how_much you owe to that august emperor for his great zeal for the Catholic religion . Therefore your trust in him and your grateful obedience should daily shine more brightly . A similar zeal should be manifest in your pursuit of all that pertains to the security and glory of the Catholic religion , whether already well established or to be established as times and circumstances indicate . We very much desire_that the University of Cracow , an old and noble seat of learning , retain its soundness and pre eminence ; We would even like it to rival the praises of such academies which_the outstanding care of the episcopate and the generosity of private individuals have established with Our encouragement . In your academies , under the skillful direction of Our Cardinal and Bishop , serious studies should proceed in friendly agreement with_faith , giving as much assistance for the defense of the faith as they borrow light and strength from it . Again it should be a great concern of yours , as it -isaia- of Ours , that religious_orders flourish and enjoy a good reputation in the minds of all . They are commended by the perfection of virtue they eagerly pursue , by the diversity of their teaching , and by their fruitful labor in the care of souls . They are_-atti_degli_apostoli- hand to the Church as a ready militia , and the state has used them as good helpers for all kinds of worthy tasks . Looking back to Galicia in particular , We recall with_great good_will the ancient Order of St . Basil , the restoration of which_has concerned Us . Its cheerful , religious obedience to Our expectations overjoyed Us . Now this order -isaia- well on its way to regaining its former glory for it -isaia- useful to the local Church in many_ways . Under its guidance , the vigilance of the episcopate and the industry of the priests shine more brightly every_day . Permit Us to repeat an exhortation about the Ruthenians . Though you differ from them in origin and rite , be joined to them more_closely in will and loving association as becomes those_who share the same region , the same state , but especially_the same faith . For the Church considers them to be deserving of good_will and loves them as her_children to whom she , with wise discretion , permits legitimate customs and their_own rites . So you too , with the clergy in the forefront , must cherish them as brothers whose hearts and souls are_one , striving finally to the end that the glory of the one God and Lord increase and the fruit of justice be multiplied in '' the beauty of peace . With a loving mind We also turn Our prayer to you_who inhabit the province of Gniezno and Poznan . Indeed , We are pleased to recall , among other_things , that We have raised to the See of Adalbert , with the consent of all of you , one of your countrymen , a man of extraordinary piety , prudence and love . We are even_more pleased to see with what obedience and love you strive to be subject to his gentle rule . For this_reason We are_able to hope_that the Catholic religion will_continue to grow among_you . We urge you to trust the generous equity of the Emperor . We personally experienced , on more_than one occasion , what a benevolent mind he has for you . He will certainly help you if you continue in respect_for law and in the praise of things well done . These precepts and exhortations , Venerable Brethren , We desire each of you to communicate to your flocks so that_your labors may prove more fruitful . In these_things Our beloved_sons wil perceive Our great love for them . That Our beloved_children receive these exhortations with obedience and piety -isaia- what We desire most . If they keep these precepts diligently , and We are certain that_they_will , they will_be_able to avoid the dangers to their_faith , to cherish the memorable deeds of their fathers , and to emulate their spirit and example . From these will flow the best rewards for their solace also in this_life . We ask you earnestly to join Us in requesting divine help through the intercession of the glorious Virgin Mary , St . Joseph , whose feast the Christian people celebrate today , and all the heavenly patrons of Poland . As a sign of these_things and a testimony of Our special benevolence , We lovingly impart Our Apostolic Blessing to you , to your_clergy , and to the people entrusted_to_your care . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , March , , the seventeenth year of Our pontificate .
