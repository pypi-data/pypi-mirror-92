Venerable Brothers , Greetings andApostolic Benediction . We rejoice that the fruit of Our paternal concern_for your nation has_been great , due especially to your efforts . Clinging to Our instructions in the apostolic_letter which We gave on July , , you_have labored to arouse piety in the laity and to revive the old discipline in the clergy . Nor are We ignorant of how_great an effort you expended to preserve the safety and rights of the religious societies which_have come forth_from the old religious communities of your region in order to recall them to their pristine glory . Clerics from Europe are profitably associated_with these societies . The noble ardor of these European brothers was_not inhibited by the long voyage , nor by the inclemency of the weather , nor by the difference in customs . In addition , many groups founded recently were summoned by your zeal to establish or to govern colleges , to engage in missions , or to perform other functions of the priestly_ministry for_which the number of your_clergy scarcely sufficed . It must be a great consolation to you that_your seminaries have increased in number and have_been improved . These happy beginnings and the progress realized up to now inspire Us to hope_that the time -isaia- not far away when your hierarchy , already enlarged by Us , will respond with_greater growth . We base Our hope on your proven zeal and your well_known diligence and on the Brazilian people themselves , who_are inclined to piety both by character and by custom . Separate Facilities for Seminarians . However , there_are_some things_which are so important_for the progress of the Catholic religion that it does_not suffice to mention them only once ; they demand to be recalled and recommended often . Such -isaia- the concern_for establishing seminaries , to the condition of which_the future fortunes of tae Church are intimately joined . Therefore , in setting up their discipline , that_which some bishops have_already performed should be your highest priority : that the aspirants to the priesthood should live in special houses called '' seminaries '' with_their own rules and laws . The houses for young_people destined for civil life , can be called episcopal colleges . Experience indicates that mixed seminaries do not respond effectively to the plan and the wisdom of the Church . This common life with the laity -isaia- the principal reason clerics abandon their_vocation . We should accustom future clerics from an early age to bear the yoke of the Lord , to find time for spiritual_exercises , to be devoted to their sacred duties , and to conform themselves to the example of the priestly life . Therefore , they_should be protected from dangers , separated_from everything worldly , and educated according to the rules set_forth by Saint Charles Borromeo just as We see accomplished in the major seminaries of Europe . In order to avoid dangers , vacations in the country should be provided for these students , but they_should not return to their homes . Many bad examples lie in wait for the unwary , especially in settlements where_the families of workers are crowded together . Thus , these young_men , inclined toward youthful desires , may be either turned away from their undertaking or they , as future priests , may_become a stumbling block to the people . We recommend this system to you which has_already_been tried with_good results by several bishops . We ask that_you improve the protection of the young clergy in the future by a law commonly agreed upon . It -isaia-_also Our desire , as We have_already told you , that effort should be devoted to publishing and distributing Catholic newspapers since -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time the people form their opinions and draw their moral guidelines from no other source than from the daily reading of such newspapers . It -isaia- with regret that We see these weapons cast down among good people since these_are drawn_from the hands of the impious and lead to the ruin of faith_and_morals . Therefore , the style of your newspapers should be sharpened and the literary expression aroused so that frivolity may give way to truth and the minds_of_men may gradually follow_the voice of right_reason . Joined to the advantage of the religious press -isaia- another advantage , that_which results from the access of Catholics to public office and from their admission to the legislative assemblies . For the word_-isaia- no less powerful than the pen ; influence and authority can serve the good cause as well as the written word . It would even be appropriate to send men in holy_orders to these legislative assemblies . The rights of the Church would best be defended by these guardians of religion . But they_should beware lest the effort made toward this_end be so great that_they seem to be motivated more by miserable ambition and blind partisanship than by love of the Catholic cause . What -isaia- more undignified than_that clerics engage in struggle , and by their administration of the State introduce sedition and discord , the most pernicious things for the State ? And what if , following bad counsel , they continually oppose the established authority ? . The only result of such behavior -isaia- a great scandal for the people and a source of ill feeling toward_the clergy . Civil power should be exercised with moderation ; every suspicion of ambition should be avoided ; public offices should be won prudently , and no deviation should be made from true obedience to the supreme_authority . It pleases Us to encourage those arts by which_the Christian cause may be promoted among_you . May your resources not be less_than your good_will and may the realization of your excellent plans not be hindered by the lack of money ! Contrary to the past , the public treasury no longer provides money for you , for the canons , for the seminaries , for the priests , or for the construction of churches . That leaves you only_one resource : the charity of the people . Nonetheless , the custom of the Brazilian people offers great hope in this_matter ; they_are always ready to be generous , especially_when this results in obtaining the favors of the Church . We have_already praised them in Our letter mentioned above in which We said_that We command nothing concerning the endowment of the poorest of the new dioceses ; We have confidence in the piety and the faith of the Brazilians that_they_will not abandon their bishops . We would place before you as an example the liberality with_which_the Catholics of North America come to the aid of their numerous bishops , their Catholic colleges , schools , and other religious institutions , but your nation abounds in similar , magnificent examples . We have_not forgotten how_many splendid churches your ancestors constructed , how_many monasteries they endowed , and what great monuments of Christian piety and kindness they left for you . There are many_ways to come to the aid of the Church . The most useful , in Our opinion , -isaia- to establish in each diocese a fund to which_the faithful can contribute an annual offering collected by men_and_women selected from the more noble families , under the orders and direction of the priests . These people should_also be the principal givers . They will accomplish this best if they give something from their assured income which -isaia-_often very considerable , and if from their uncertain income they impose on themselves a contribution like a tax . Another aid , no less important , can be furnished to poor bishops by the monasteries and the pious associations which_have a surplus . These associations would contribute more to the common_good if they gave the sum of money which some of them are accustomed to spend on public shows to the diocesan fund . Finally , if the wealthier of the faithful want to follow_the laudable custom of their ancestors and to exercise their kindness by making provision in their wills for religious associations or other pious groups , We strongly encourage them to bequeath a portion of their fortune to the bishops so that the bishops , provided with resources , might guard the interests of the Church and their_own dignity . We have promoted your cause , Venerable Brothers . The injustices of the age compel even Us to have_recourse to Peter s pence constantly . Take courage in the thought that_you can have confidence in God '' because He Himself takes care of Us . '' Keep in mind these_words of the Apostle : '' He who provides seed for the sower and bread for the eater will provide in abundance ; He will multiply the seed you sow and increase the yield of your righteousness . May the priests and people -atti_degli_apostoli- whose head the Holy Spirit placed you as bishops keep before their_eyes the liberality of the first Christians who '' were of one heart and one mind '' who , more concerned for the society of the Church than for their_own fortune , '' sold their property , brought the price , and placed it -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of the apostles . '' May they remember the words of Paul with_which We shall conclude : '' We beg you , brothers , respect those among_you whose task it -isaia- to exercise authority in the Lord and admonish you ; esteem them_with_the greatest love because_of_their work . Meanwhile , as a pledge of heavenly blessings and as a sign of Our good_will , We affectionately give Our apostolic_blessing to you_,_venerable_brothers , to your_clergy , and to your_people . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s on the eighteenth day of September in the year , the twenty second year of Our pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .
