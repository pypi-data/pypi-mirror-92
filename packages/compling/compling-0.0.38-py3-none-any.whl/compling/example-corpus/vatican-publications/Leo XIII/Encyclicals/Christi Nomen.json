Our first duty -isaia- to spread the name and reign of Christ more widely every_day , and to call back the mutinous and the wandering to the bosom of the Church ; this_has occupied Our concern_for a long time . For this_reason We never cease to safeguard and multiply pious projects and to support them_with_the help gathered from the Catholic people . By this_means the powerful light of Christian wisdom -isaia- spread among the erring . We did this especially in the third year of Our pontificate with the encyclical_letter Sancta Dei Civitas in order to win for the illustrious Society for the Propagation of the Faith both greater support and generosity from the faithful . Then We were pleased to follow with exhortations showing how it had grown in a short time , from small beginnings to so large a stature ; and with what testimonies of praise and grants of indulgences Our illustrious predecessors , Pius VII , Leo XII , Pius VIII , Gregory XVI , Pius IX had honored it . Finally , Our exhortations demonstrated how_much aid had been_given to the sacred missions throughout_the_world from this source , and how much_more was to be expected . Nor by God s blessing was_the fruit small in response to this_exhortation . In the following years we saw the expansion of this_most worthy work , since_the generosity of the faithful responded to the zeal and the perseverance of the bishops . But now there_-isaia- a new need and one more grave , which_may demand_that the spirit of Catholic love become more wide spread . Venerable Brethren , may it stimulate your skill . From the apostolic_letter Praeclara published last June , you know_that We invited and urged all nations to the unity of the Christian faith . Thus , through Us the divine promise of '' one sheepfold and one Pastor '' would be realized . You have learned from Our recent apostolic letters concerning the safeguarding of the Eastern Rites that We look with special_care to the East and its churches , renowned and venerated by many names . From these same letters you_have learned the procedures by which , in consultation with the Eastern patriarchs , We have investigated how to bring_about more readily the desired end , namely the union of the Roman and Eastern Catholic Churches . We do not deny that_this goal involves great difficulties . To overcome them , Our strength -isaia- not sufficient ; nevertheless We confidently judge that the necessary strength of trust and of constancy -isaia- found in God . For He who motivated Us to undertake this_mission will in His providence certainly supply the strength and the resources to complete it . And this_-isaia-_what We implore from Him , and We exhort all the faithful to also pray earnestly for_this . Since the divine help must necessarily be joined with human effort , it -isaia- right for Us therefore to expend special_care in seeking and supporting whatever seems to contribute to the end We have in view . To ensure_that the Eastern Christians who_have seceded will return to the onetrue Church , it -isaia- necessary to provide them_with an abundance of holy ministerswho , endowed_with doctrine and piety , may persuade the others to accept thedesired unity . In addition , Catholic wisdom and life must be made_known andimparted to them in such a fashion that it will fir their national charactercongenially . Therefore houses must be opened wherever expedient for the sacrededucation of the youth , a sufficient number of high schools should be available , distributed according to population . Their power of exercising each rite maythus be supplied with dignity . Genuine knowledge of religion , should be extendedto all by making the best literature available . You can easily understand thecosts of these and similar ventures . You also understand_that the EasternChurches by themselves cannot meet all these expenses . Nor can We Ourselves inthese hard rimes offer the help We would_like . Suitable aid must be askedprincipally from the Society for the Propagation of the Faith which We have justnow praised . Its purpose -isaia- entirely consonant with what We now have in mind . But lest apostolic missions , deprived in part of the aids by which_they aresustained , suffer any harm , We must insist that the generosity of the Catholicstoward the Society become greater . It -isaia- fitting_that a similar concern also beapplied to the Society for the Schools of the East whose growth We encouraged , especially since its directors have openly promised to contribute as much as possible_for this worthy cause . For this , venerable_brothers , We particularly ask your assistance . We do notdoubt that_you , who_are so eager to support with Us the cause of the Church , will undertake this outstanding work . Zealously see_to_it_that the Society forthe Propagation of the Faith grows as much as possible among the faithfulentrusted to your_care . We are certain_that many more will eagerly give boththeir name and their resources to this Society if they see clearly itsexcellence , the abundance of spiritual gifts it has to offer , and the benefitswhich can now be rightly hoped for the Christian cause . It certainly should moveCatholic men to know that_they_can do nothing for Us so pleasing , nor sosalutary for themselves and the Church than to meet Our desires by contributing . With their contributions We can accomplish what We have resolved upon for thegood of the Eastern Church . May God , who alone_-isaia- glorified with the spread ofthe Christian name and its unity in faith and government , graciously bless Ourbeginnings and favor Our desires . As an auspice of His choicest blessing , Venerable Brethren , We most lovingly give Our Apostolic Blessing to all of you , your_clergy and your_people . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St .
