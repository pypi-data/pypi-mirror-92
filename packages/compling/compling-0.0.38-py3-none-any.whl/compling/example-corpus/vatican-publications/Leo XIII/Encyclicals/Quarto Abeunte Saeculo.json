Now that four centuries have sped since a Ligurian first , under God s guidance , touched shores unknown beyond_the Atlantic , the whole world_-isaia- eager to celebrate the memory of the event , and glorify its author . Nor could a worthier reason be found where through zeal should be kindled . For the exploit -isaia- in itself the highest and grandest which any age has_ever seen accomplished by man ; and he who achieved it , for the greatness of his mind_and_heart , can be compared to but few in the history of humanity . By his toil another world emerged from the unsearched bosom of the ocean : hundreds of thousands of mortals have , from a state of blindness , been raised to the common level of the human_race , reclaimed from savagery to gentleness and humanity ; and , greatest of all , by the acquisition of those blessings of which Jesus Christ -isaia- the author , they_have_been recalled from destruction to eternal_life . Europe , indeed , overpowered -atti_degli_apostoli- the time by the novelty and strangeness of the discovery , presently came to recognize what_was due to Columbus , when , through the numerous colonies shipped to America , through the constant intercourse and interchange of business and the ocean trade , an incredible addition was_made to our knowledge of nature , and to the commonwealth ; whilst -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the prestige of the European name was marvellously increased . Therefore , amidst so lavish a display of honour , so unanimous a tribute of congratulations , it -isaia- fitting_that the Church should_not be altogether silent ; since she , by custom and precedent , willingly approves and endeavours to forward whatsoever she see , and wherever she see it , that_-isaia- honourable and praiseworthy . It -isaia- true she reserves her special and greatest honours for virtues that_most signally proclaim a high morality , for these_are directly associated_with the salvation_of_souls ; but she does_not , therefore , despise or lightly estimate virtues of other kinds . On the contrary , she has_ever highly favoured and held in honour those_who_have deserved well of men in civil_society , and have thus attained a lasting name among posterity . For God , indeed , -isaia-_especially wonderful in his Saints mirabilis in Sanctis suis ; but the impress of His Divine virtue also appears in those_who shine with excellent power of mind and spirit , since high intellect and greatness of spirit can be the property of men only through_their parent and creator , God . But there_-isaia- , besides , another reason , a unique one , why We consider that_this immortal achievement should be recalled by Us with memorial words . For Columbus -isaia- ours ; since if a little consideration be given to the particular reason of his design in exploring the mare tenebrosum , and also the manner in which he endeavoured to execute the design , it -isaia- indubitable that the Catholic faith was_the strongest motive for the inception and prosecution of the design ; so that_for this_reason also the whole_human_race owes not a little to the Church . For we have_the record of not_a_few brave and experienced men , both before and after Christopher Columbus , who with stubbornness and zeal explored unknown lands and seas yet more unknown . And the memory of these , man , mindful of benefits , rightly holds , and will hold in honour ; because_they advanced the ends of knowledge and humanity , and increased the common prosperity of the race , not by light labour , but by supreme exertion , often accompanied by great dangers . But there_-isaia- , nevertheless , between these and him of whom we speak , a generous difference . He was distinguished by this unique note , that in his_work of traversing and retraversing immense tracts of ocean , he looked for a something greater and higher than did these others . We say not_that he was unmoved by perfectly honourable aspirations after knowledge , and deserving well of human_society ; nor did he despise glory , which_-isaia- a most engrossing ideal to great souls ; nor did he altogether scorn a hope of advantages to himself ; but to him far before all these human considerations was_the consideration of his ancient faith_,_which questionless dowered him_with strength of mind and will , and often strengthened and consoled him in the midst of the greatest difficulties . This view and aim -isaia- known to have possessed his mind above all ; namely , to open a way_for the Gospel over new lands and seas . This , indeed , may seem of small likelihood to such as confine their whole thought and care to the evidence of the senses , and refuse to look for anything higher . But great intellects , on the contrary , are usually wont to cherish higher ideals ; for they , of all men , are_most excellently fitted to receive the intuitions and breathings of Divine faith . Columbus certainly had joined to the study of nature the study of religion , and had trained his mind on the teachings that well up from the most intimate depths of the Catholic faith . For this_reason , when he learned from the lessons of astronomy and the record of the ancients , that_there were great tracts of land lying towards_the West , beyond_the limits of the known world , lands hitherto explored by no man , he saw in spirit a mighty multitude , cloaked in miserable darkness , given over to evil rites , and the superstitious worship of vain gods . Miserable it -isaia- to live in a barbarous state and with savage manners : but more miserable to lack the knowledge of that_which_-isaia- highest , and to dwell in ignorance of the one true God . Considering these_things , therefore , in his mind , he sought first of all to extend the Christian name and the benefits of Christian charity to the West , as -isaia- abundantly proved by the history of the whole undertaking . For when he first petitioned Ferdinand and Isabella , the Sovereigns of Spain , for fear lest they_should be reluctant to encourage the undertaking , he clearly explained its object : '' That their glory would grow to immortality , if they resolved to carry the name and doctrine of Jesus Christ into regions so distant . '' And in no long time having obtained his desires , he bears_witness : '' That he implores of God that , through His Divine aid and grace , the Sovereigns may continue steadfast in their desire to fill these new missionary shores with the truths of the Gospel . '' He hastens to seek missionaries from Pope Alexander VI , through a letter in which_this sentence occurs : '' I trust that , by God s help , I may spread the Holy Name and Gospel of Jesus Christ as widely as may be . '' He was carried away , as we think , with_joy , when on his_first return from the Indies he wrote to Raphael Sanchez : '' That to God should be rendered immortal thanks , Who had brought his labours such prosperous issues ; that Jesus Christ rejoices and triumphs on earth no less_than in Heaven , -atti_degli_apostoli- the approaching salvation of nations innumerable , who_were before hastening to destruction . '' And if he moved Ferdinand and Isabella to decree that_only Catholic Christians should be suffered to approach the New World and trade with the natives , he brought forward as reason , '' that he sought nothing from his enterprise and endeavour but the increase and glory of the Christian religion . '' And this_was well_known to Isabella , who better_than any had understood the great man s mind ; indeed it -isaia- evident_that it had_been clearly laid before that_most pious , masculine minded , and great souled woman . For she had declared of Columbus that he would boldly thrust himself upon the vast ocean , '' to achieve a most signal thing , for the sake of the Divine glory . '' And to Columbus himself , on his second return , she writes : '' That the expenses she had incurred , and was about to incur , for the Indian expeditions , had_been well bestowed ; for thence would ensure a spreading of Catholicism , '' . In truth , except for a Divine cause , whence was he to draw constancy and strength of mind to bear those sufferings which to the last he was obliged to endure ? We allude to the adverse opinions of the learned , the rebuffs of the great , the storms of a raging ocean , and those assiduous vigils by which he more_than_once lost the use of his sight . Then in addition were fights with savages , the infidelity of friends and companions , criminal conspiracies , the perfidy of the envious , and the calumnies of detractors . He must needs have succumbed under labours so vast and overwhelming if he had not_been sustained by the consciousness of a nobler aim , which he knew would bring much glory to the Christian name , and salvation to an infinite multitude . And in contrast with_his achievement the circumstances of the time show with wonderful effect . Columbus threw open America -atti_degli_apostoli- the time_when a great storm was about to break over the Church . As far , therefore , as it -isaia- lawful for_man to divine from events the ways of Divine Providence , he seemed to have truly been born , by a singular provision of God , to remedy those losses which_were awaiting the Catholic Church on the side of Europe . To persuade the Indian people to Christianity was , indeed , the duty and work of the Church , and upon that duty she entered from the beginning , and continued , and still continues , to pursue in continuous charity , reaching finally the furthest limits of Patagonia . Columbus resolved to go before and prepare the ways for the Gospel , and , deeply absorbed in this idea , gave all his energies to it , attempting hardly anything without religion for his guide and piety for his companion . We mention what_-isaia- indeed well_known , but -isaia-_also characteristic of the man s mind and soul . For being compelled by the Portuguese and Genoese to leave his object unachieved , when he had reached Spain , within_the wall of a Religious house he matured his great design of meditated exploration , having for confidant and adviser a Religious a disciple of Francis of Assisi . Being -atti_degli_apostoli- length about to depart for the sea , he attended to all that_which concerned the welfare of his_soul on the eve of his enterprise . He implored the Queen of Heaven to assist his efforts and direct his course ; and he ordered that no sail should be hoisted until the name of the Trinity had_been invoked . When he had put out to sea , and the waves were now growing tempestuous , and the sailors were filled_with terror , he kept a tranquil constancy of mind , relying on God . The very names he gave to the newly discovered islands tell the purposes of the man . At each disembarkation he offered up prayers to Almighty God , nor did he take possession save '' in the Name of Jesus Christ . '' Upon whatsoever shores he might be driven , his_first act was to set upon the shore the standard of the holy Cross : and the name of the Divine Redeemer , which_he_had so often sung on the open sea to the sound of the murmuring waves , he conferred upon the new islands . Thus -atti_degli_apostoli- Hispaniola he began to build from the ruins of the temple , and all popular celebrations were preceded by the most_sacred ceremonies . This , then , was_the object , this_the end Columbus had in view in traversing such a vast extent of land and water to discover those countries hitherto uncultivated and inaccessible , but_which , afterwards , as we have_seen , have_made such rapid strides in civilization and wealth and fame . And in truth the magnitude of the undertaking , as well as the importance and variety of the benefits that arose from it , call_for some fitting and honourable commemoration of it among_men . And , above all , it -isaia- fitting that_we_should confess and celebrate in an especial manner the will and designs of the Eternal Wisdom , under whose guidance the discoverer of the New World placed himself_with a devotion so touching . In order , therefore_,_that the commemoration of Columbus may be worthily observed , religion must give her assistance to the secular ceremonies . And as -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of the first news of the discovery public thanksgiving was offered by the command of the Sovereign Pontiff to Almighty God , so now we have resolved to act in like_manner in celebrating the anniversary of this auspicious event . We decree , therefore_,_that on October , or on the following Sunday , if the Ordinary should prefer it , in all the Cathedral churches and convent chapels throughout Spain , Italy , and the two Americas , after_the office of the day there shall be celebrated a Solemn Mass of the Most Holy Trinity . Moreover , besides the abovementioned countries , We feel assured that the other nations , prompted to it by the counsel of their bishops will likewise join in the celebration , since_it_-isaia- fitting_that an event from which all have derived benefit should be piously and gratefully commemorated by all . Meanwhile , as a pledge of heavenly favours and of Our own paternal goodwill , we lovingly bestow the Apostolic Benediction in Our Lord upon you , Venerable Brethren , and upon your clergy_and_people .
