While We are burdened with much sadness in knowing to what a sorrowful state the Church in Ecuador -isaia- reduced , We were very pleased by your timely and publicly proclaimed ordinances . In your pastoral_care , you did not_hesitate to protest loudly these laws which_are opposed not_only to the rights of the Church but_also to divine right . You protested them right from the time they_were proposed . You devoted all your zeal and effort before the damage was done to prevent the public orators from carrying_out their ruinous legislative intention . You are_not unaware of the undemanding forebearance We have devoted to restoring the religious tranquillity of your_country . This -isaia- of the greatest importance for the good of the Church and of the State . But , the hopes which We had , the hopes which encouraged almost all the people of Ecuador , have perished miserably . In fact , not_only has no reparation been_made for previous destructive injustices , but other very serious injustices have_been added to them . We see_that a diocese which_was constituted according to the holy canons has_been abolished . We know_that bishops have_been appointed to vacant dioceses , without_any privilege from the Holy See . We also know_that the sanctity of Christian marriage has_been impeded in various_ways . The Nature of Christian Marriage . We have treated this_matter often in other letters , especially in Our apostolic_letter of February . In it We emphasized the nature of Christian marriage , its strength , the care the Church has devoted to protecting its honor and its rights , and the role of civil authority in its regard . As it -isaia- evident_that Christ , the son of God , redeemer and restorer of human_nature , raised Christian marriage to the dignity of a sacrament , every Christian marriage -isaia- this_sacrament . The matter of the contract can be separated in some sense from the nature of the sacrament . This means_that while the civil authority retains in full its right to regulate the so called civil effects , the marriage itself_-isaia- subject to the authority of the Church . In addition , it -isaia- certain_that Jesus , the redeemer of every race , abolished the custom of repudiation , strengthened marriage with holy power , and reinstated the law of permanence just as it was established by the will of God from the beginning . It follows then that the marriage of Christians when fully accomplished -isaia- holy , indivisible , and perfect . It cannot be dissolved for_any reason other_than the death of either spouse according to the holy words : '' What God has joined , let no man divide . '' In so doing , Christ certainly intended to confer many benefits on the human_race , for_this institution most effectively preserves or restores morality , fosters the love of one spouse for the other , confirms families with divine strength , renews the education and protection of offspring , maintains the dignity of woman , and finally establishes the honor and the prosperity of familial and civil association in the most beneficial and excellent way . Condemnation of Civil Marriage . Therefore , in accordance_with Our duty as supreme teacher which_makes Us guardian and champion of divine and ecclesiastical law , We raise our voice and totally condemn the so called civil marriage laws recently enacted in Ecuador . Concerning divorces , We reject them together_with every assault on the holy discipline of the Church there . The fact that_these laws have_been established in the face of your opposition and are so much -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the development of civil prosperity and the interests of religion_-isaia- no reason_for you to be disheartened . You should rather increase your zeal for religion and be more vigilant . Continue therefore as you_are doing to defend the neglected and spurned rights of the Church without yielding todefeat . Teach the faithful entrusted_to_your care and educate them so that theypreserve the reverence due to their leaders ; be faithful to the teaching of theCatholic religion and practice Christian morality . With earnest and eagerprayers to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus to whom your people_have been solemnlydedicated above all nations , you all should ask that He deign to bestow happiertimes on the Church of Ecuador through the abundance of His mercies . We stillremain your companion and share in your sorrows and supplications . Meanwhile , asa sign of Our good_will and as a pledge of divine gifts , We impart lovingly inthe Lord Our apostolic_blessing to you and to your faithful . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the th day of December in the year , the twenty fifth year of Our Pontificate .
