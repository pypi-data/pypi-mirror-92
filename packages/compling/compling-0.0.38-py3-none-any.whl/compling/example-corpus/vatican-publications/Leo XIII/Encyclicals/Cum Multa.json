Venerable Brethren and Beloved Sons , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . Many are the points in which_the noble and generous Spanish nation has shown itself preeminent ; but_above all others , and worthy of the highest praise , -isaia- their preservation , through so varied a succession of men and of events , of that_love of the Catholic faith with_which_the prosperity and greatness of Spain have_always appeared to be bound up . Of this affection various proofs might be mentioned , but the chief one_-isaia- that peculiar devotion to this Apostolic Chair of which Spaniards have_given such repeated and striking testimony by all manner of manifestations , by letters , by their liberality , and by their pilgrimages . The recollection must still be fresh of that recent period when Europe beheld their courage and their piety , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the Holy See became a victim of dire and unfortunate circumstances . In all this , Beloved Sons and Venerable Brethren , We recognize not_only a special grace from God but the fruit of your zeal , and likewise the all praiseworthy disposition of the people itself , which in these times , so hostile to Catholic interests , clings with the greatest watchfulness to the religion of its fathers as to an inheritance , and does not_hesitate to oppose itself to the greatness of the danger with an equal greatness of resolution . Nothing can be more hopeful for Spain , if only these dispositions be quickened by charity and strengthened by a lasting harmony . The Necessity of Union Amongst Catholics . But on this_point We cannot suppress the truth ; when We mark the conduct which some Spaniards deem themselves justified in pursuing , We experience a feeling akin to that anxious solicitude of the Apostle St . Paul for the Corinthians . The perfect union of Catholics among_themselves , and especially with_their Bishops , had ever been secure and undisturbed in Spain , and led Our predecessor , Gregory XVI , to address to the Spanish people the well merited eulogium that '' the immense majority had persevered in its ancient reverence towards_the Bishops and the inferior clergy canonically instituted . '' But now , owing to party rivalry , signs are showing themselves of dissensions which_are dividing minds , as it were , into different camps , and greatly disturbing even societies founded for a purely religious object . It happens often that in discussions as to the best manner of defending Catholic interests the authority of the Bishops has not_that weight which_should belong to it . Sometimes even , if a Bishop recommends or decrees something in virtue of his_power , there_are people_who will submit to it but ill , or even openly criticize it , assuming that_he_has wished thereby to favour some or hinder others . Yet it -isaia- easy to see_how important it -isaia- that_unity should exist among the minds_of_men , and all the more so that , amid the unfettered prevalence everywhere of error and in the war so violently and insidiously waged against the Catholic Church , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_that all Christians would unite their wills and powers in resistance , for fear that separately they_may be crushed by the cunning and violence of their foes . Moved , therefore , by the thought of such dangers , We have addressed these Letters to you , Beloved Sons , Venerable Brethren ; and We most earnestly call_upon you to be the interpreters of Our salutary warning , and to employ your wisdom and your authority in the maintenance of concord . The Relations Between Religion and Politics . Here , however , it will be fitting to recall_the mutual relations of the spiritual and of the temporal order , for_many minds on this_matter fall_into a two fold error . There are_some , for instance , who_are_not satisfied with distinguishing between politics and religion but separate and completely isolate the one from the other ; they wish them to have nothing in common , and imagine that the one_should exercise no influence over the other . Such men , in truth , differ but little from those_who desire the exclusion of God , the Creator and Sovereign of all things , from the constitution and administration of the State ; and the error they profess -isaia- the more pernicious that_they thereby rashly debar the State from its most abundant source of prosperity . The moment religion_-isaia- removed , those principles are of necessity shaken on which_the public welfare most of all rests , and which drive their greatest force from religion , among the first of which_are government with justice and moderation , obedience from a sense of duty , the submission of the passions to the yoke of virtue , to render to each his due , to leave untouched that_which_-isaia- another s . But , though this opinion -isaia- to be avoided , the contrary error must likewise be shunned of those_who identify religion with some one political party and confound these together to such a degree as to look on all of another party as undeserving any longer of the name of Catholic . This -isaia- an intrusion of political factions into the August realm of the Church ; it -isaia- an attempt to break the union of brothers , and to open the gate and give access to a multitude of grievous troubles . The spiritual and temporal orders being , therefore , distinct in their origin and in their nature , should be conceived and judged of as such . For matters of the temporary order however lawful , however important they be do not extend , when considered in themselves , beyond_the limits of that life_which we live on this our earth . But religion , born of God , and referring all things to God , takes a higher flight and touches heaven . For her will , her wish , -isaia- to penetrate the soul , man s best part , with the knowledge and the love of God and to lead in safety the whole_human_race to that City of the Future which we seek for . It -isaia- , then , right to look on religion , and whatever_-isaia- connected by any particular bond with it , as belonging to a higher order . Hence , in the vicissitudes of human affairs , and even in the very revolutions in States , religion , which_-isaia- the supreme good , should remain intact ; for it embraces all times and all places . Men of opposite parties , though differing in all else , should be agreed unanimously in this : that in the State the Catholic religion should be preserved in all its integrity . To this noble and indispensable aim , all who love the Catholic religion ought , as if bound by a compact , to direct all their_efforts ; they_should be somewhat silent about their various political opinions , which_they_are , however , -atti_degli_apostoli- perfect liberty to ventilate in their_proper place : for the Church -isaia- far from condemning such matters , when_they_are not opposed to religion or justice ; apart and removed from all the turmoil of strife , she carries on her work of fostering the common weal , and of cherishing all men with the love of a mother , those particularly whose faith and piety are greatest . The Authority of Bishops and the Respect Due to Them . The fundamental principle of this concord of which We speak -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once the same in religion and in every rightly constituted State ; it -isaia- obedience to the lawful authority which orders , forbids , directs , legislates , and thus establishes harmonious union amid the diverse minds_of_men . We shall here have to repeat some well_known truths , which , however , ought not to be the subjects of mere speculative knowledge , but should become rules applicable to the practice of life . Now , even as the Roman Pontiff -isaia- the Teacher and Prince of the Universal Church , so likewise are Bishops the rulers and chiefs of the Churches that have_been duly intrusted to them . Each has within his_own jurisdiction the power of leading , supporting , or correcting , and generally of deciding in such matters as may seem to affect religion . For they share in the power which Christ Our Lord received_from_the Father , and transmitted to His Church : and therefore Gregory IX . , Our Predecessor , said of Bishops , '' We do not_hesitate to declare that the Bishops called on to share Our cares are the representatives of God '' This power has_been_given to Bishops for the supreme benefit of those over whom it -isaia- exercised ; it tends by its_very nature to the building up of the Body of Christ ; and makes of each Bishop and bond which unites in faith and charity the Christians under his guidance -atti_degli_apostoli- once with one_another and with the Supreme Pontiff , as members with the head . Here -isaia- a weighty expression of St . Cyprian s : '' The Church -isaia- the people united with its pastors , and the flock that follows its Shepherd : '' and another , still_more weighty : '' Know ye , that the Bishop -isaia- in the Church , and the Church in the Bishop : and if any_one be not_with the Bishop , the same -isaia- not in the Church '' Such , unchangeable and everlasting , -isaia- the constitution of the Christian commonwealth ; if it be not religiously maintained , a disturbance of rights_and_duties ensues as a necessary consequence of the broken association of the members whose perfect union constitutes the body of the Church , that body which '' by joints and bands being supplied with nourishment and compacted , groweth unto the increase of God '' We see , therefore_,_that Bishops should_have paid to them that respect which_the eminence of their charge exacts , and receive in all matters within their office a perfect obedience . The Clergy and Political Parties . In face of the passions that -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment are troubling the minds of so many in Spain , We exhort , nay , We conjure , all Spaniards to recall this so important duty and to fulfil it with all zeal . Let those , especially , who_are of the clergy , and whose words and example exercise such potent influence , scrupulously apply themselves to observe moderation and obedience . For be it known to them that_their toil in the fulfilment of their_duties will be most profitable to themselves and efficacious to their neighbour , when_they follow in full submission the guidance of him_who_-isaia- placed over them as head of the diocese . Assuredly it -isaia- not conduct consonant with the duties of the priesthood to give oneself up so entirely to the rivalries of parties as to appear more busy with the things of men than with_those of God . They must , therefore , studiously avoid overstepping the reserve imposed on them by their office . If they only observe this rule faithfully , We are convinced_that the Spanish clergy will render daily by their virtues , their wisdom , and their labours the greatest services -atti_degli_apostoli- once to the salvation_of_souls and to the interests of the State . Rules Which Should Guide Catholic Associations . We deem those associations peculiarly fitted to aid them in this work_which are , so to speak , the auxiliary forces destined to support the interests of the Catholic religion ; and We approve , therefore , their object and the energy they display ; We ardently desire that_they_may increase in number and in zeal , and that_from day to day their fruits may be more abundant . But since_the object of such societies -isaia- the defence and encouragement of Catholic interests , and as it -isaia- the Bishops who , each in their_proper diocese , have to watch over those interests , it naturally follows that_they_should be controlled by their Bishops , and should set great value on their authority and commands . In the next place they_should with equal care apply themselves to preserving union , first because on the agreement of men s wills all the power and influence of any human_society depends ; and next , because in the societies of which We speak that mutual charity should especially be found which necessarily accompanies good_works and -isaia- the characteristic trait of those_whom Christian discipline has moulded . Now as it may easily happen that the members may differ on politics , they_should recall to themselves the aim of all Catholic associations , and thereby prevent political partisanship from disturbing their cordial unity . In their discussions the members ought to be so completely penetrated by the thought of the purpose they united for as to seem of no party , remembering the words of the Apostle St . Paul : '' For as many of you as have_been baptized in Christ have put on Christ . There -isaia- neither Jew nor Greek ; there_-isaia- neither bond nor free . For you_are all one in Christ Jesus '' . Such rules of conduct will_lead not_only to amiable and friendly relations among the several members of these societies , but_also between societies of a similar character , an object extremely desirable . Thus , by the exclusion of party rivalries , the principal sources of dispute will be avoided ; and all will be enlisted in the service of the one cause , the highest and noblest , about which no disagreement can exist among Catholics worthy of the name . And for the Conduct of the Catholic Press . Lastly it -isaia- most important_that those_who defend the interests of religion in the press , and particularly in the daily papers , should_take up the same attitude . We are aware of the objects they strive to attain and the intentions with which_they_have entered the arena , and We cannot_but concede to them well earned praise for their good service to the Catholic religion . But so lofty , so noble , -isaia- the cause to which_they_have devoted themselves , that it exacts from the defenders of truth and justice a rigorous observance of numerous duties which_they must_not fail to fulfil ; and in seeking to accomplish some of these , the others must_not be neglected . The admonitions , therefore , which_we_have given to associations , We likewise give to writers ; We exhort them to remove all dissensions by their gentleness and moderation , and to preserve concord amongst themselves and in the people , for the influence of writers -isaia- great on either side . But nothing can be more opposed to concord than biting words , rash judgments , or perfidious insinuations , and everything of this_kind should be shunned with the greatest care and held in the utmost abhorrence . A discussion in which are_concerned the sacred rights of the Church and the doctrines of the Catholic religion should_not be acrimonious , but calm and temperate ; it -isaia- weight of reasoning , and not violence and bitterness of language , which_must win victory for the Catholic writer . These rules of conduct will be , in Our judgment , of great use in removing the causes which impede perfect concord . It will be your task , Beloved Sons , Venerable Brethren , to explain Our thoughts to the people and to endeavour to the utmost of your power to make all conform their_lives to the rules We have here laid_down . We are confident that_the_faithful of Spain will embrace them of their_own accord , as well from their tried devotion to this Apostolic Chair , as from a sense of the benefits which_are rightly to be expected from concord . Let them recall_the facts of their_own history ; let_them recognize_that the glorious exploits of their ancestors -atti_degli_apostoli- home and abroad could_not have_been achieved had their forces been scattered by dissensions , and were only possible owing to their perfect union . Animated by brotherly_love and all inspired by the same sentiments , they triumphed over the haughty domination of the Moors , over heresy , and over schism . Let the faithful of Spain imitate the example of those from whom they_have inherited faith and fame , and show that_they inherit not_only their ancestors name but their virtues also . We believe , moreover , Beloved Sons and Venerable Brethren , that to promote union and uniformity in discipline , it will be well that the Bishops of each province should often deliberate among_themselves and with_their Archbishop , consult about one_another s interests , and , when circumstances require it , address themselves to that Apostolic See whence flow the integrity of faith , the power of discipline , and the light of truth . The numerous pilgrimages which are_being projected in Spain will afford a most favourable opportunity . Nothing can , indeed , be more fit to allay dissensions and to decide controversies than the voice of him whom Our Lord Jesus Christ has constituted the Vicar of His power , and the wealth of heavenly graces which flow in streams from the tomb of the Apostles . But , since all '' our strength -isaia- of God , '' join yourselves with Us in fervent prayer to God that He may give efficacy to Our teaching and render the people ready to receive it with docility . May the august Mother of God , the Immaculate Virgin Mary , Patroness of Spain , deign to favour Our common efforts ! May We also be helped by the Apostle St . Teresa of Jesus , the virgin law giver and great light of Spanish wisdom , in whom_the love of concord , affection for_her country , and perfect Christian obedience were equally conspicuous . In the meanwhile , as a pledge of Heavenly gifts and in token of Our fatherly good_will , We here lovingly bestow on you in the Lord , Beloved Sons , Venerable Brethren , and on all the people of Spain , Our Apostolic Benediction . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the th day of December , , in the fifth year of Our Pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .
