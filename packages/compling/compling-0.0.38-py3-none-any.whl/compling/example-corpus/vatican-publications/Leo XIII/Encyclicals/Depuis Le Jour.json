Venerable Brothers , Dearly Beloved Sons Since the day we were raised to the Pontifical Chair France has_been ever the object to us of a special solicitude and affection . For from her God , in the unfathomable designs of His mercy over the world , has in the course of ages by preference chosen Apostolic men destined to preach the true faith to the limits of the globe , and to carry the light of the Gospel to the nations yet plunged in the darkness of paganism . He predestined her to be the defender of His Church and the instrument of His great works : Gesta Dei per Francos . Obviously this high mission entails duties many and grave . Wishing , like our_predecessors , to see France faithfully fulfil the glorious mandate wherewith she has_been entrusted , we have on several occasions during our long pontificate addressed to her our advice , our encouragement , our exhortations . This we did in a special_way in our Encyclical Letter of February , , Nobilissima Gallorum gens , and in our letter of February , , published in French and beginning with the words : '' Au milieu des sollicitudes . '' Our words were not_without fruit , and we know from you , Venerable Brothers , that a large portion of the French people ever holds in honor the faith of their ancestors and faithfully observes the obligations it imposes . On the other_hand , it could_not escape us that the enemies of this_holy faith have_not been idle and have succeeded in banishing every religious principle from a large number of families , which , in consequence , live in lamentable ignorance of revealed_truth , and in complete indifference to all that concerns their_spiritual interests and the salvation of their_souls . While therefore with good_reason we congratulate France on being a focus of apostolic work among nations destitute of the faith , we are_also bound to encourage the efforts of those of her sons who , enrolled in the priesthood of Jesus Christ , are laboring to evangelize their_own people , to preserve them_from the invasion of naturalism and incredulity , with_their fatal and inevitable consequences . Called by the will of God to be the savour of the world , priests must_always , and above all things , remember_that they_are by the very institution of Jesus Christ , '' the salt of the earth , '' and hence St . Paul , writing to Timothy , justly concluded that '' by their charity , their_faith and their purity , they_must be an example to the faithful in their words and in their relations with_their neighbors . That such_-isaia- true of the French clergy , taken as a whole , has_always_been a great consolation to us to learn , Venerable Brothers , from the quadrennial reports you send us concerning the state of your dioceses , conformably to the Constitution of Sixtus V , and from the oral communications we receive from you whenever we have_the happiness of conversing with you and receiving your confidences . Yes , dignity of life , ardor of faith , a spirit of devotedness and sacrifice , a zeal characterized by enthusiasm and generosity , an inexhaustible charity toward their neighbor , energy in all noble and fruitful enterprises making for the glory of God , the salvation_of_souls and the welfare of their_country these_are the precious qualities traditional among the French clergy , and we are happy to be able here to render to them a public and fatherly testimony . Still , precisely on account of the deep and tender affection we have for them , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to perform a duty of our Apostolic ministry and respond to the keen desire we feel to see them ever acting up to their great mission , we have resolved , Venerable Brothers , to treat in this_letter of certain points to which present circumstances peremptorily call the conscientious attention of the chief pastors of the French Church and of the priests_who work under their jurisdiction . And in the first_place it -isaia- clear_that the more_important , complex and difficult an office -isaia- the longer and more careful should be the preparation undergone by those_who_are called to fill it . But -isaia- there on earth a dignity higher than_that of the priesthood or a ministry imposing a heavier responsibility than_that whose object -isaia- the sanctification of all the free acts of man ? Is it not of the government of souls that the Fathers have rightly said that_it_-isaia- '' the art of arts ; '' that_-isaia- , the most important and most delicate of all tasks to which a man may be applied for the benefit of his kind ? '' Ars artium regimen animarum ? '' Nothing must then be neglected to prepare those_whom a divine vocation calls to this_mission in order that_they_may fulfill it worthily and fruitfully . To begin with , from among the young those are to be selected in whom_the Most High has sown the seeds of a vocation . We are aware_that , thanks to your wise recommendations , in many dioceses of France the priests of the different parishes , especially in country districts , apply themselves_with a zeal and self sacrifice which we cannot sufficiently praise in guiding themselves the studies of children in whom they_have observed a marked tendency to piety and an aptitude for intellectual work . The presbyteral schools are thus_the first step , as it were , of the stairs which from the junior to the senior seminaries carry up to the priesthood those young_men to whom_the Saviour repeats the appeal He addressed to Peter and Andrew , to John and James , '' Leave your nets ; follow Me , I will_make you fishers of men . With regard to the junior seminary , this_very valuable institution has_been frequently and justly compared to the beds in which_are set apart such plants as call_for the most particular and assiduous care as the only way to make_them bear_fruit and produce a recompense for the labors of their cultivation . On this_subject , we renew the recommendation addressed by our predecessor , Pius IX . , to the Bishops in his Encyclical of December , . This -isaia- itself based on one_of_the_most important decisions of the Fathers of the Council of Trent . To France belongs the glory of having held it in most account during the present century , for of the ninety four dioceses in the country there_-isaia- not one which_-isaia-_not endowed_with one or more junior seminaries . We know , Venerable Brothers , the solicitude which_you bestow on these institutions so justly dear to your pastoral zeal , and we congratulate you on it . The priests_who labor , under your superintendence , for the formation of the youth called to enroll itself later on in the ranks of the sacerdotal army , cannot too_often meditate before God on the exceptional importance of the mission with_which you entrust them . They have not_simply to instruct their_children in the elements of letters and human science , like the general run of masters that_-isaia- the least part of their task . Their attention , zeal and devotion must be ever on the watch and active , in order , on the one_hand , to study continually , under the eye and in the light of God , the souls of the children and the indications of their_vocation to the service of the altar , and , on the other , to help the inexperience and feebleness of their young disciples in order to protect the precious grace of the Divine call against all deadly influences , both from without and from within . They have therefore to exercise a ministry that_-isaia- humble , laborious and delicate , and requires constant abnegation . To sustain their courage in the fulfilment of their_duties , they_will take_care to temper it in the purest sources of the spirit of faith . They must_never lose sight of the fact_that the children whose intelligence , heart and character they_are engaged in forming are_not being prepared_for earthly functions , however legitimate or honorable . The Church confides those children to them in order that_they_may one_day be fit to become priests ; that_-isaia- to say , missionaries of the Gospel , continuers of the work of Jesus Christ , distributers of His Grace and His Sacraments . Let this purely supernatural consideration incessantly imbue their double function as professors and educators , and be the leaven , so to say , which_-isaia- to be mixed with the best flour , according to the Gospel parable , so as to transform it into sweet and substantial bread . And as an abiding thoughtfulness for the first and indispensable formation of the spirit and virtues of the priesthood should inspire the masters of your junior seminaries in their relations with_their pupils , so , too , the system of study and the whole economy of discipline must be allied to this_same primary and directing idea . We are_not unaware , Venerable Brothers , that_you are to a certain extent obliged to reckon with the State programme and with the conditions imposed by it for obtaining university degrees , owing to the fact_that in certain cases such degrees are required of priests engaged in the management of free colleges under the patronage of the Bishops and religious congregations , or in the higher teaching of Catholic faculties which_you have so laudably established . It -isaia- , moreover , of sovereign importance for the maintenance of the influence of the clergy on society that_they count among their ranks a sufficient number of priests yielding nothing in science , of which degrees are the official evidence , to the masters whom_the State trains for its lyceums and universities . Nevertheless , after making all the allowances imposed by circumstances for_this exigency of the State programme , the studies of aspirants to the priesthood must remain faithful to the traditional methods of past ages . It -isaia- these which_have produced the eminent men of whom France -isaia- so justly proud the Petaus , Thomassins , Mabillons and many_others , to say nothing of your Bossuet , called the Eagle of Meaux , because in loftiness of thought and nobility of expression his genius soars in the highest regions of Christian science and eloquence . The study of belles lettres rendered mighty aid in making these_men valiant and useful workers in the service of the Church and capable of writing works which_were truly worthy to pass down to posterity , and which contribute even to day to the defense and propagation of revealed_truth . For the belles lettres have_the property , when taught by skilful Christian masters , of rapidly developing in the souls of young_men all the germs of intellectual and moral_life , whilst -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time contributing accuracy and broadness to the judgment and elegance and distinction to expression . This consideration assumes special importance when applied to Greek and Latin literature , the depositaries of those masterpieces of sacred science which_the Church with good_reason counts among her most_precious treasures . Half a century ago , -atti_degli_apostoli- that period all too brief ! of true liberty , during which_the bishops of France were free to meet and concert such measures as they deemed best calculated to further the progress of religion , and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , most profitable to the public peace , several of your Provincial Councils , Venerable Brothers , recommended in the most express terms the culture of the Latin tongue and literature . Even then your colleges deplored the fact_that the knowledge of Latin in your_country tended to diminish . But if the methods of pedagogy in vogue in the State establishments have_been for several years past progressively reducing the study of Latin and suppressing the exercises in prose and poetry which_our fathers justly considered should hold a large place in college classes , the junior seminaries must put themselves on their guard against these innovations , inspired by utilitarian motives and working to the detriment of the solid formation of the mind . To the ancient methods so often justified by their results we would freely apply the words of St . Paul to his disciple Timothy , and with the apostles we would say to you , Venerable Brothers , '' Guard the deposit '' with jealous care . If it should be destined which God forbid ! one_day to disappear from the other public schools , let your junior seminaries and free colleges keep it with an intelligent and patriotic solicitude . Doing so , you will be imitating the priests of Jerusalem , who , saving the sacred fire of the temple from the barbarian invader , so hid it as to be able to find it again and restore it to its splendor when_the evil day should_have passed . Once in possession of the Latin tongue the key , so to say , of sacred science and their mental faculties sufficiently developed by the study of the belles lettres , young_men destined for the priesthood pass from the junior to the senior seminary . There they_will prepare themselves by piety and the exercise of the priestly virtues for the reception of Holy Orders , while devoting themselves to the study of philosophy and theology . In our Encyclical '' Aetemi Patris , '' which we once_again recommend to the attentive perusal of your seminarists and their masters , we declared , with St . Paul as our authority , that_it_-isaia- by the empty subtleties of false philosophy '' per philosophiam et inanem fallaciam '' that the minds of the faithful_are most frequently led astray and the purity of the faith corrupted among_men , we added , and the events of the last twenty years have furnished bitter confirmation of the reflections and apprehensions we expressed -atti_degli_apostoli- the time . If one notes the critical condition of the times in which we live and ponders on the state of affairs in public_and_private life he will_have no difficulty in seeing that the cause of the evils which oppress us , as well as those_which menace , lies in the fact_that erroneous opinions on all subjects , human and divine , have gradually percolated from philosophical schools through all ranks of society , and have come to be accepted by a large number of minds . We renew our condemnation of those teachings of philosophy which_have merely the name , and which by striking -atti_degli_apostoli- the very foundation of human knowledge lead logically to universal skepticism and to irreligion . We are profoundly grieved to Learn that_for some years past some Catholics have felt -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty to follow in the wake of a philosophy which under the specious pretext of freeing human_reason from all preconceived ideas and from all illusions , denies it the right of affirming anything beyond its_own operations , thus sacrificing to a radical subjectivism all the certainties which traditional metaphysics , consecrated by the authority of the strongest thinkers , laid_down as the necessary and unshakable foundations for the demonstration of the existence of God , the spirituality and immortality of the soul , and the objective reality of the exterior world . It -isaia- to be deeply regretted that_this doctrinal skepticism , of foreign importation and Protestant origin , should_have been received with so much favor in a country so justly celebrated for its love of clearness of thought and expression . We know , Venerable Brothers , how far you share our well grounded anxiety on this_subject , and we reckon on you to redouble your solicitude and vigilance in shutting out this fallacious and dangerous philosophy from the teaching in your seminaries , and to honor more_than_ever the methods we recommended in the above quoted Encyclical of August , . In our_times the students in your junior and senior seminaries can less_than ever afford to be strangers to the study of physical and natural science . To it , therefore , they_must apply themselves but in due measure and in wise proportions . It -isaia- by no means necessary_that in the scientific course annexed to the study of philosophy the professors should feel themselves obliged to expound in detail the almost innumerable applications of physical and natural sciences in the different branches of human industry . It -isaia- enough that_their pupils have an accurate knowledge of the main principles and summary conclusions , so as to be able to solve the objections which infidels draw from_these sciences against the teachings of Revelation . It -isaia- of capital importance that the students of your senior seminaries should study , for -atti_degli_apostoli- least two years , with_great care , '' rational '' philosophy , which , as the learned Benedictine Mabillon , the glory of his order and of France , used to say , will be of the greatest assistance to them , not_only in teaching them how to reason well and arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- right conclusions , but in putting them in a position to defend the orthodox faith against the captious and often sophistical arguments of adversaries . Next come the sacred sciences , properly so called Dogmatic and Moral Theology , Sacred Scripture , Church History and Canon Law . These are the sciences proper to the priest in them he receives a first initiation during his sojourn in the senior seminary , but he must pursue his studies in them throughout_the remainder of his_life . Theology -isaia- the science of the things of faith . It -isaia- nourished , Pope Sixtus V tells us , -atti_degli_apostoli- those ever willing springs the Holy Scriptures , the decisions of the Popes , the decrees of the Councils . Called positive and speculative or scholastic , according to the method followed in studying it , theology does_not confine itself to proposing the truths_which are to be believed ; it scrutinizes their inmost depths , shows their relations with human_reason , and , aided by the resources which true philosophy supplies , explains , develops and adapts them accurately to all the needs of the defense and propagation_of_the_faith . Like Beseleel , to whom_the Lord gave His spirit of wisdom , intelligence and knowledge , when intrusting him_with the mission of building His temple , the theologian '' cuts the precious stones of divine dogma , assorts them skilfully , and , by the setting he gives them , brings out_their brilliancy , charm and beauty . Rightly , then , does the same Sixtus V . call theology and here he -isaia- referring especially to scholastic theology a gift from heaven , and ask that it be maintained in the schools and cultivated with_great ardor , as being abundant in fruitfulness for the Church . Is it necessary to add that the book par excellence in which students may with most profit study scholastic theology -isaia- the Summa Theologica of St . Thomas Aquinas ? It -isaia-_our wish , therefore_,_that professors be sure to explain to all their pupils its method , as well as the principal articles relating to Catholic faith . We recommend equally that all seminarists have in their hands , and frequently peruse , that golden book known as the Catechism of the Council of Trent , or Roman Catechism , dedicated to all priests invested with the pastoral_office Catechismus ad Parochos . Noted both_for the abundance and accuracy of its teaching and for elegance of style , this catechism -isaia- a precious summary of the whole of theology , dogmatic and moral . The priest who knows it thoroughly has_always -atti_degli_apostoli- his disposal resources which will_enable him to preach with fruit , to acquit himself fitly in the important ministry of the confessional and the direction of souls , and be in a position to refute triumphantly the objections of unbelievers . With regard to the study of the Holy Scriptures , we call your attention once_more , Venerable Brothers , to the teachings we laid_down in our Encyclical '' Providentissimus Deus , '' which we wish the professors to put before their disciples , with the necessary explanations . They will put them specially on their guard against the disturbing tendencies which_it_-isaia- sought to introduce into the interpretation of the Bible , and which_would shortly , were they to prevail , bring_about the ruin of its inspiration and supernatural character . Under the specious pretext of depriving the adversaries of the revealed word of apparently irrefutable arguments against the authenticity and veracity of the Holy Books , some Catholic writers have thought it a clever idea to adopt those arguments for themselves . By these strange and perilous tactics they_have worked to make a breach with_their own hands in the walls of the city they_were charged to defend . In our Encyclical above quoted , and in another document , we have spoken our_mind on this rash , dangerous policy . While encouraging our exegetists to keep abreast with the progress of criticism , we have firmly maintained the principles_which have_been sanctioned in this_matter by the traditional authority of the Fathers and Councils , and renewed in our own_time by the Council of the Vatican . The history of the Church -isaia- like a mirror , which reflects the life of the Church through the ages . It proves , better far than civil and profane history , the sovereign liberty of God and His providential action on the march of events . They who study it must_never lose sight of the fact_that it contains a body of dogmatic facts which none may call in question . That ruling , supernatural idea which presides over the destinies of the Church -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the torch whose light illumines her history . Still , inasmuch as the Church , which continues among_men the life of the Word Incarnate , -isaia- composed of a divine and human element , this latter must be expounded by teachers and studied by disciples with_great probity . '' God has no need of our lies , '' as we are told in the Book of Job . The Church historian will be all the better equipped to bring out her_divine origin , superior as this_-isaia- to all conceptions of a merely terrestrial and natural order , the more loyal he -isaia- in naught extenuating of the trials which_the faults of her_children , and -atti_degli_apostoli- times even of her ministers , have brought upon the Spouse of Christ during the course of centuries . Studied in this_way , the history of the Church constitutes by itself a magnificent and conclusive demonstration of the truth and divinity of Christianity . Lastly , to finish the cycle of studies by which candidates_for_the_priesthood should prepare themselves for their future ministry , mention must be made of Canon Law , or the science of the laws and jurisprudence of the Church . This science -isaia- connected by very close and logical ties with_that of Theology , which it applies practically to all that concerns the government of the Church , the dispensation of holy things , the rights_and_duties of her ministers , the use of temporal goods which_she needs for the accomplishment of her_mission . '' Without a knowledge of Canon Law as the Fathers of one of your provincial councils very well said , theology -isaia- imperfect , incomplete , like a man with only_one arm . Ignorance of Canon Law has favored the birth and diffusion of numerous errors about the rights of the Roman Pontiffs and of Bishops , and about the powers which_the Church derives from her_own Constitution powers whose exercise she adapts to circumstances . We shall sum up all we have just said concerning your junior and senior seminaries in this sentence of St . Paul , which we recommend to the frequent meditation of the masters and pupils of your ecclesiastical athenaeums : '' O Timothy , carefully guard the deposit which_has_been confided to you . Fly the profane novelties of words and objections which cover themselves_with the false names of science , for all they_who have_made profession of them have erred in the faith . And now we have a word to say to you , dearly beloved_sons , who_have_been ordained priests and become the cooperators of your Bishops . We know , and the whole_world knows with us , the qualities which distinguish you . There -isaia- no good work of which_you are_not the inspiration or the apostles . Docile to the counsels we gave you in the Encyclical '' Rerum Novarum , '' you go to the people , to the workers , to the poor . You endeavor by all means in your power to help_them , raise them in the moral scale , render their lot less hard . To this_end you form reunions and congresses ; you establish homes , clubs , rural banks , aid and employment offices for the toilers . You labor to introduce reforms into economic_and_social life , and in the difficult enterprise you do not_hesitate to make serious sacrifices of time and money ; and with the same scope you write books and articles in the newspapers and reviews . All these_are , in themselves , highly praiseworthy , and in them you give no equivocal proofs of good_will and of intelligent and generous devotedness to relieve the most pressing needs of contemporary society and of souls . Still , beloved_sons , we deem it our_duty paternally to call your attention to some fundamental principles to which_you will not_fail to conform if you desire_that your activity be really fruitful and reproductive . Remember , above all , that zeal , to be profitable and praiseworthy , must be '' accompanied by discretion , rectitude and purity . '' Thus does the grave and judicious Thomas a Kempis express himself . Bernard , the glory of your_country in the twelfth century , that indefatigable apostle of all great causes touching the honor of God , the rights of the Church or the good of souls , did_not fear to say that '' zeal , separated_from knowledge and from the spirit of discernment or discretion , -isaia- insupportable . that the more ardent zeal -isaia- , the more necessary -isaia- it that it be accompanied by that discretion which puts order into the exercise of charity and without_which even virtue may be changed into a defect and a principle of disorder . '' And discretion in activity and in the choice of means of rendering activity successful -isaia- all the more indispensable from the fact_that the present times are disturbed and environed with numerous difficulties . This or that act , measure or practice , suggested by zeal , while excellent in themselves , can_only owing to the circumstances of the race produce bad results . Priests will avoid this inconvenience and this evil , if before and during their action they take_care to conform to established order the rules of disciplines . And ecclesiastical discipline demands union among the different members of the hierarchy , and the respect and obedience of inferiors to their superiors . In our recent letter to the Archbishop of Tours we said the same thing : '' The edifice of the Church of which God Himself -isaia- the architect , rests on a very visible foundation , primarily on the authority of Peter and his_successors , but_also on the Apostles and the successors of the Apostles , the Bishops , so that to hear their voice or to despise it -isaia- tantamount to hearing or despising Jesus Christ Himself . Listen , then , to the words addressed by St . Ignatius , the great martyr of Antioch , to the clergy of the primitive Church : '' Let all obey their Bishops , as Jesus Christ obeyed His Father . In all things touching the sense of the Church do nothing without your Bishop , and as our Lord did nothing but in close union with His Father , so priests , do you nothing without your Bishop . Let all members of the priestly body be united , as all the strings of a harp are_united in the instrument . Should you , on the contrary , act as priests independently of this submission to and union with your Bishops , we would repeat to you the words of our predecessor , Gregory XVI , viz . , that '' you utterly destroy , as far as in you lies , the order established with a most wise forethought by God , the author of the Church . Remember , too , beloved_sons , that the Church -isaia- rightly compared to an army in battle array '' sicut castrorum acies ordinata , '' because_it_-isaia- her_mission to combat the enemies , visible and invisible , of God and men s souls . Paul recommend Timothy to bear himself '' as a good soldier of Jesus Christ ? '' Now , that_which constitutes the strength of an army and contributes most to its victory -isaia- discipline and the exact and rigorous obedience of all toward those in command . Just here zeal out of place and without discretion may easily become the cause of real disaster . Call to mind one_of_the_most memorable facts of sacred history . Certainly neither courage , willingness , nor devotion to the sacred cause of religion were lacking in those priests_who gathered round Judas Maccabeus , to fight with_him against the enemies of the true God , the profaners of the temple , the oppressors of their nation . And yet , releasing themselves from the rules of discipline , they rashly engaged in a combat in which_they were vanquished . The Holy Spirit tells us of them '' that_they were_not of the race of those_who might save Israel . '' Why ? Because they_would obey only their_own inspirations , and threw themselves forward without awaiting the orders of their leaders . '' In die illa ceciderunt sacerdotes in bello , dum volunt fortiter faccre , dum sine consilio exeunt in praelium . Ipsi autem non erant de semine virorum illorum , per quos salus facto -ester- in Israel . On this_point our enemies may serve us for an example . They are_well aware_that union -isaia- strength , '' vis unita fortior , '' so they_do_not fail to unite close when it comes to attacking the holy Church of Jesus Christ . If , then , you desire , as you certainly do , beloved_sons , that in the formidable contest being waged against the Church by anti Christian sects and by the city of the evil one , the victory be for God and His Church , it -isaia- absolutely necessary_for you to fight all together in perfect order and discipline under the command of your hierarchical leaders . Pay no heed to those pernicious men_who , though calling themselves Christians and Catholics , throw tares into the field of the Lord and sow division in His Church by attacking and often even calumniating the Bishops '' established by the Holy Ghost to rule_the Church of God . '' Read neither their pamphlets nor their papers . No good priest should in any_way lend authority either to their ideas or to their license of speech . Can he ever forget_that on the day of his ordination he promised '' obedientiam et reverentiam '' to his Bishop before the holy altar ? . Above all things , remember , beloved_sons , that an indispensable condition of true zeal and the best pledge of success in the works to which hierarchical obedience consecrates you -isaia- purity and holiness of life . '' Jesus began by practicing before preaching . '' Like Him , the priest must preface preaching by word by preaching by example . '' Separated from the world and its concerns say the Fathers of the Council of Trent , clerics have_been placed on a height where_they are visible and the faithful look into their_lives as into a mirror to know what_they are to imitate . Hence clerics and all they whom God has called specially to His service should so regulate their actions and morals that_there may be nothing in their deportment , manners , movements , words and in all the other details of their_life which_-isaia-_not deeply impressed with religion . They must carefully avoid faults which , though trivial , in others would be very serious to them , in order_that there be not a single one of their acts which_does_not inspire respect in all . '' With these recommendations of the sacred Council , which we would wish , beloved_sons , to engrave in all your hearts , those priests_who certainly fail to comply , who adopted in their preaching language our of harmony_with_the dignity of their priesthood and the sacredness of the word of God ; who attended popular meetings where their presence could only excite the passions of the wicked and of the enemies of the Church , and who exposed themselves to the grossest insults without profit to any_one , and to the astonishment , if not scandal , of the pious faithful ; who assumed the habits , manners , conduct and spirit of laymen . Salt must certainly be mingled with the mass which_it_-isaia- to preserve from corruption , but it must -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time defend itself against the mass under pain of losing all savor and becoming of no use except to be thrown out and trampled under foot . So , too , the priest who_-isaia- the salt of the earth must in his necessary contact_with_the society by which he -isaia- surrounded , preserve modesty , gravity and holiness in manner , action and speech , and not_allow himself to become infected with the levity , dissipation and vanity of the worldly . He must , on the contrary , in the midst of the men , keep his_soul so united with God that he lose nothing of the spirit of his holy state , and be not constrained to make before God and his conscience the sad and humiliating avowal : '' I never go among laymen that I do not return less a priest . Is it not because_they have , with a zeal that_-isaia- presumptive , set_aside those traditional rules of discretion , modesty and prudence that certain priests consider as out of date and incompatible with '' the present needs of the ministry those principles of discipline and conduct which_they received_from their masters in the senior seminary ? '' They are to be seen rushing , as if by instinct , into the most perilous innovations in speech , manners and associations . Several of them , alas ! rashly putting themselves on the slippery incline from which_they_have no native power to escape , and despising the charitable warnings of their superiors and their older and more experienced colleagues , have ended in apostasies which rejoice the hearts of the adversaries of the Church and brought bitterest tears into the eyes of their Bishops , their_brothers in the priesthood and the pious faithful . Augustine tells us : '' When a man_-isaia- out of the right way the more quickly and impetuously he advances , the more he errs . There are , of course , some changes which_are advantageous and calculated to advance the kindgom of God in men s souls and in society . But , as the Holy Gospel tells us , it -isaia- the province of the '' Father of the household '' and not of the children or servants to examine them , and , if he judges well , to give_them currency side by side with the time honored and venerable usages , which_make up the rest of his treasury . Lately when fulfilling the apostolic duty of putting the Catholics of North America on their guard against innovations , tending , among other_things , to substitute for the principles of perfection consecrated by the teaching of doctors and the practice of saints moral maxims and rules of life more_or_less impregnated with_that naturalism which nowadays endeavors to penetrate everywhere , we proclaimed aloud that far from repudiating and rejecting '' en bloc '' the progress accomplished in the present epoch , we were only too anxious to welcome all that goes to augment the patrimony of science or to give greater extension to public prosperity . But we took care to add that_this progress could be of efficacious service to the good cause only_when harmonized with the authority of the Church . As a conclusion to this_letter we are pleased to apply to the clergy of France what we formerly wrote for the priests of our diocese of Perugia . We reproduce here a portion of the pastoral letter we addressed to them on July , : . '' We ask the ecclesiastics of our diocese to reflect seriously on their sublime obligations and on the difficult circumstances through_which we are passing and to act in such wise that_their conduct be in harmony_with their_duties and always conformable to the rules of an enlightened and prudent zeal . For thus even our enemies will seek in vain for motives of reproach and blame : qui ex adverso -ester- vereatur nihil habens malum dicere de nobis . '' Although difficulties and dangers are every_day multiplying , the pious and fervent priest must_not for that be discouraged he must_not abandon his duties or even draw rein in the accomplishment of the spiritual mission he has_received for the welfare and salvation of mankind and for the maintenance of that august religion of which he -isaia- herald and minister . For it -isaia-_especially by difficulties and trials that_his virtue becomes strong and stable ; it -isaia- in the greatest misfortunes , in the midst of political transformations and social upheavals that the salutary and civilizing influence of his_ministry shines_forth with greatest brilliancy . To come down to practice we find a teaching admirably adapted to the circumstances in the four maxims which_the great Apostle St . Paul gave to his disciple Titus . In all things give good example by your works , your doctrine , the integrity of your life , by the gravity of your conduct , using none but holy and blameless language . We would that each_and_every member of our clergy meditate on these maxims and conform his conduct thereto . '' In omnibus teipsum praebe exemplum bonorum operum . In all things give an example of good_works ; that_-isaia- , of active and exemplary life , animated by a true spirit of charity and guided by the maxims of evangelical prudence of a life of sacrifice and toil , consecrated to the welfare of your neighbors , not_with earthly views or for a perishable reward , but_with a supernatural object . Give an example by that language -atti_degli_apostoli- once simple , noble and lofty , by that sound and blameless discourse which confounds all human opposition , calms the long standing hatred the world has sworn against you , and wins for you the respect and even esteem of the enemies of religion . Every one devoted to the service of the sanctuary has_been -atti_degli_apostoli- all times obliged to show himself a living model and perfect exemplar of all the virtues ; but_this obligation becomes all the more instant when , as a consequence of social upheavals , we are treading a difficult and uncertain path where we may -atti_degli_apostoli- every step discover ambushes and pretexts of attack . In the face of the combined efforts of incredulity and heresy to consummate the ruin of Catholic faith , it would be a real crime for the clergy to remain in a state of hesitancy and inactivity . In such an outpouring of error and conflict of opinion he must_not prove faithless to his_mission , which_-isaia- to defend dogma assaulted , morality travestied and justice frequently outraged . It -isaia- for him to oppose himself as a barrier to the attacks of error and the deceits of heresy ; to watch the tactics of the wicked who war on the faith and honor of this Catholic country ; to unmask their plots and reveal their ambuscades ; to warn the confiding , strengthen the timid and open the eyes of the blinded . Superficial erudition or merely common knowledge will_not suffice for all this there_-isaia- need of study , solid , profound and continuous , in a word of a mass of doctrinal knowledge sufficient to cope with the subtlety and remarkable cunning of our modern opponents . No better proof of the importance of this council could be had than the sad evidence of what_-isaia- going on around us . Do we not observe that the lax life of some ecclesiastics brings discredit and contempt on their_ministry and proves the occasion of scandals ? If men , endowed_with minds as brilliant as they_are remarkable , now and then desert the ranks of the sacred soldiery and rise in revolt against the Church that mother who , in her tenderness and affection had advanced them to the direction and for the salvation_of_souls , their defection and wanderings have most frequently had their origin in want of discipline and evilness of life . By gravity -isaia- to be understood that serious , judicious , tactful conduct which_should be characteristic of every faithful and prudent minister chosen by God for the government of His family . While thanking God for having vouchsafed to raise him to this honor , he must show himself faithful to all his obligations , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time balanced and prudent in all his actions ; he must not_allow himself to be dominated by base passions , nor carried away by violent and exaggerated language ; he must lovingly sympathize with the misfortunes and weaknesses of others ; do all the good he can to every_one , disinterestedly , unostentatiously , and maintaining ever intact the honor of his character and sublime dignity . We return now to you , beloved_sons in the French clergy , and we are firmly convinced_that our perceptions and counsels , solely inspired as they_are by our_paternal affection , will be understood and received by you in this_sense and bearing we wished to give_them in addressing you this_letter . We expect much from you , because God has richly endowed you with all the gifts and qualities necessary_for performing great and holy deeds for the advantage of the Church and society . We would that_not one among_you permit himself to be tarnished by those imperfections which dim the splendor of the sacerdotal character and injure its efficacy . The present times are evil ; the future -isaia- still_more gloomy and menacing , and seems to herald the approach of a redoubtable crisis and social upheaval . It behooves us , then , as we have_said on many occasions , to honor the salutary principles of religion , as well as those of justice , charity , respect and duty . It -isaia- for us to imbue men s souls with these_principles and especially_those souls which have_become captive to infidelity or disturbed by destroying passions , to bring_about the reign of the grace and peace of our Divine Redeemer Who -isaia- the Light and the Resurrection and the Life , and in Him to unite all men , notwithstanding the inevitable social distinctions which divide them . Yes , now more_than_ever , -isaia- there need of the help and devotedness ofexemplary the help and devotedness of exemplary priests , full of faith , discretion and zeal , who , taking inspiration from the gentleness and energy of Jesus Christ , Whose true ambassadors they_are , '' proChristo legatione fungimur , '' to announce with acourageous and inexhaustible patience the eternal truths_which are seldom fruitless of Virtuein men s souls . Their ministry will be laborious oftentimes even painful , especially in countries where_the people_are absorbed in worldly interests andlive in forgetfulness of God and His holy religion . But the enlightened , charitable and unwearying influence of the priest fortified by Divine gracewill work , as it has_already worked , prodigies of resurrection almost beyond belief . With all our soul arid with unspeakable joy we hail this consoling vista , and meanwhilewith all the affection of our_heart we grant theApostolic Benediction to you_,_venerable_brothers , and to the clergy_and_people of France . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the th ofSeptember , in the year , the twenty second of our Pontificate .
