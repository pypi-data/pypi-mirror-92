Amid the many grave cares which continually divide and oppress Us , We gladly received_the obedient letter which_you , Venerable Brothers , sent us after your synod in the city of Lima . Reading it with the paternal love We have for you and your_people , We were greatly delighted with the repeated proofs of your love and trust in Us and this See of Blessed Peter . But We were most pleased by the common zeal with_which you met in obedience to Our desires to deal_with the gravest concerns of religion and to improve the moral conduct in that best flock over which_the Holy Spirit has placed you as bishops . We completely approve this determination to ensure_that your faithful stand firm in sincere adherence to the Catholic faith . Nevertheless it -isaia- Our pleasure to add new incentives , just as to runners in a race , so that_you continue strenuously as you_have begun and attend such synods as opportunity or necessity may dictate . For We are convinced by the long standing belief of the Church , as We have declared many times , that the most effective means of opposing widespread creeping error and of safeguarding religion_-isaia- to have_the sacred bishops more_closely united among_themselves , sharing plans and proposals . We know_the religious situation in Peru and desire_that Catholicism flourish there . So in order_that these synods may be more useful to your faithful , We will detail what matters you_should direct your attention to . These are_most apt to fortify the road of faith and unfetter the efficacy of the Church . For this_reason We have_never ceased to inculcate them in frequent general documents and in individual letters to bishops . First , direct your efforts to inculcating the discipline of good morals and a lively zeal for acquiring knowledge in the seminarians . This will ensure_that the studies which now decline and languish among the youths growing up as the hope of the Church will attain that splendor which We justly desire and which_the religious times require . For you know_that the plan of divine_providence was this : -atti_degli_apostoli- first to use the valiant martyrs to break the manifest opposition and ferocity of tyrants , so that_their blood would be the seed of Christianity ; then according to the same plan to destine men of outstanding wisdom in every_age to defend , not_only by sacred authority but by the aid of human_reason , the treasures of truth_which Christ brought to the Church . Now , however , the contagion of perverse opinions contaminates and corrupts all things , and , under the pretext of the development of doctrine , the wisdom given by God -isaia- opposed and rejected . So it -isaia- easy to understand_that there_-isaia-_a_need for defenders who_have put on the armor of knowledge and are always prepared as the Apostle warns , to satisfy everyone seeking a reason_for the hope which_-isaia- in us , and to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those_who contradict . In regulating the course of studies in your seminaries , We desire_that you consider what We have prescribed in encyclical letters concerning this_matter . Certainly in the teaching of philosophy the Angelic Doctor Thomas Aquinas -isaia- to be greatly honored . The wisdom which always flows richly from his writings and which_-isaia- considered worthy of lasting praise by Roman Pontiffs -isaia- to be imparted to the students in great and generous measure . Then the physical sciences are_not to be neglected . For besides the fact_that -atti_degli_apostoli- present they_are so highly esteemed , it -isaia- from them that_those_who hate Catholic dogmas draw their arguments to assail the truths of religion . For this_reason care must_be_taken that enough clergy are knowledgeable in such warfare to answer the detractors and refute their errors with_their own arguments . Finally observe religiously what We have recently decreed concerning the cultivation of Biblical studies . If you will do these_things , the honor of the clergy will flourish and the reputation of the Church will endure . She always was considered to be the advocate and mother of sound learning and truly should be so considered . Besides you will_have -atti_degli_apostoli- hand suitable men , called to share your ministry and most useful in teaching the faithful and promoting piety . Now another thing which We strongly commend -isaia- that_you appoint only the best men you can_find as parish priests . For those_who_are elevated to this post , full of honor and authority but fuller yet of cares and rugged byways , are those_whom the bishops choose as associates in their pastoral cares , and whom_they use especially as helpers as an example to those_who shall believe in Him for the attainment of eternal_life . For Christ Himself guides and protects His pastors ; He keeps the faithful vigilant , lest the holy people of God be endangered by the attacks of enemies and suf fer harm . They are appointed pastors of souls made to the image of their Creator , purchased for God and the Lamb not_with perishable things , with silver or gold , but_with the precious blood of Christ , as of a lamb without blemish . Therefore it -isaia- fitting that_they_are in Labor again until Christ be formed in them . As pastors , unless they prefer to be numbered among the hired servants , they_must know their sheep , nourish them_with_the food of the Word of God , and arm them_with_the armor of the sacraments . Themselves models for the flock , holding the mystery of faith with a pure conscience , let_them guide the people entrusted to them in such_a_way_that they_can say with the Apostle be imitators of me as I -amos- of Christ . With good cause they_are considered angels whom God sends before his_people to guard it on the way and through the midst of enemies to bring it to the place I have prepared , the holy city of Jerusalem to be revealed in the Last time . Since all this_-isaia- so , you see , Venerable Brothers , how_much labor -isaia- needed to select pastors and how_much continuous vigilance to keep them faithful to their office . They must be the men of whom_the words of our Lord were spoken : You are the light_of_the_world . You are the salt of the earth . Therefore choose men on fire with love and zealous concern_for souls , who_do_not seek what_-isaia- theirs but what_-isaia- Christ s , ready to endure labor and even to lay_down their_lives for their sheep . Those who strive to undertake so arduous and venerable a task for the sake of filthy gain or for_human reasons , who lack suitable holiness and learning , are to be rejected . They are mercenaries who_do_not enter by the gate , salt which_has lost its saltiness ; it -isaia- no Longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men . These things will be useful to those_who already have happily joined the flock of the Lord . But in your midst are those_who_have not_yet been_called out of darkness into His marvelous light , who sit in darkness still and in the shadow of death , sheep who now perish , whom_you must lead to Jesus , the first pastor of souls . The city of the living God , the Church -isaia- bound by no limits and stands open for the salvation of all . Her efficacy has_been_given her by her_divine Founder , and she reaches from sea to sea and daily enlarges the place of her tent and the skins of her tabernacle . Hence by right and merit she_-isaia- called Catholic . We experience and correctly know_that this coming of peoples to Sion the holy mountain -isaia- to be attributed to divine_grace and that_it_-isaia- God who_gives the Christian name its increase . No one_can come to me unless the Father draw him . This , however -isaia- the plan of the merciful God , proved by the teaching and deeds of our Redeemer , that mortal man cooperates with the work of God for the salvation_of_souls . For faith , as the Apostle tells us , depends on hearing and hearing on the word of Christ : but how are they to hear if no one preaches ? and how are men to preach unless they be sent ? Therefore We urge that sacred missions to the Indians be multiplied . May more men of mercy be found who freely and gladly may be sent as workers to the harvest of the Lord . These men do not yield to flesh and blood , but leaving their_brothers behind , do everything to win souls for Christ , to bring civilized culture and gentle manners to a barbarous people , and to dispel the darkness of ignorance , so that_they_may receive a place among_those sanctified by faith . Use the Press to Enhance Catholicism . The final matter We want you to diligently concern yourselves with -isaia- this : since in these times daily papers and magazines are abused to spread false opinions and so weaken morals , you_should consider that_it_-isaia- your turn to travel the same road and use the same means , they wickedly for destruction , you piously for edification . It will be a great help if men of virtue and learning give themselves to writing and publishing their_efforts either daily or -atti_degli_apostoli- stated times . By laying bare error gradually and carefully , truth will be disseminated and languor of minds dissipated . Then the faith nurtured in their_hearts will be professed openly and strenuously for the sake of justice . What brilliant rewards there_will be if such writers discharge their_proper duties , since_they fight for the best of causes . Clearly , as We have warned on other occasions , they_must be endowed_with moderation , prudence , and charity ; they_must strenuously defend the principles of truth and right and affirm the holy prerogatives of the Church ; they_must make known the majesty of the Apostolic See ; and they_must respect the authority of those_who govern_the state . In the performance of their_duties , however , they_must remember to love the leadership of the bishops and follow their advice . Thus , Venerable Brothers , an excellent defense may arise by which_you could recall_the people entrusted to you from the fountains of corruption and lead_them to wells of living water . Here , therefore , you have_the material We want you to consider in your synods . We have no doubt_that you will_make every certain and deliberative effort to respond to Our desires . And that_this may come about by common consent , We implore the aid of heaven , using as intercessors , together_with Mary the Immaculate Mother of God , the holy Bishop Turibius and the Virgin Rose , the first of your_country Peru and of the whole of South America to be addressed by the Church a flower of sanctity . Meanwhile , as witness of Our love , Venerable Brothers , and as a promise of divine blessings , We most lovingly impart to all of you , to the clergy , and to your_people the Apostolic Blessing . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , May l , , in the seventeenth year of Our pontificate .
