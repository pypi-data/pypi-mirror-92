We likewise empower your school of higher studies to confer all academic_degrees upon those students whose learning has_been tested and approved , and also graduate degrees in philosophy , theology and canon_law and in those other departments in which_the different degrees and doctorates are usually conferred , whenever those faculties will have_been established . We desire , furthermore , our_beloved son and venerable_brothers , that_you or competent bishops appointed by you vigilantly superintend the preservation of the correct system of studies and the discipline of students in your academic institution .
