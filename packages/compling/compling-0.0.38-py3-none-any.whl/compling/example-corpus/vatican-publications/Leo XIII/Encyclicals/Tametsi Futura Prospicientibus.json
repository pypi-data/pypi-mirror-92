Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . The outlook on the future -isaia- by no means free_from anxiety ; on the contrary , there_are_many serious reasons for alarm , on account of numerous and long standing causes of evil , of both a public and a private nature . Nevertheless , the close of the century really seems in God s mercy to afford us some degree of consolation and hope . For no one will deny that renewed interest in spiritual matters and a revival of Christian faith and piety are influences of great moment for the common_good . And there_are sufficiently clear indications -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day of a very general revival or augmentation of these virtues . For example , in the very midst of worldly allurements and in spite of so many obstacles to piety , what great crowds have flocked to Rome to visit the '' Threshold of the Apostles '' -atti_degli_apostoli- the invitation of the Sovereign Pontiff ! Both Italians and foreigners are openly devoting themselves to religious exercises , and , relying upon the indulgences offered by the Church , are_most earnestly seeking the means to secure their eternal_salvation . Who could fail to be moved by the present evident increase of devotion towards_the person of Our Saviour ? The ardent zeal of so many thousands , united in heart and mind , '' from the rising of the Sun to the going down thereof , '' in venerating the Name of Jesus Christ and proclaiming His praises , -isaia- worthy of the best days of Christianity . Would that the outburst of these flames of antique faith might be followed by a mighty conflagration ! Would that the splendid example of so many might kindle the enthusiasm of all ! For what so necessary_for our_times as a widespread renovation among the nations of Christian principles and old fashioned virtues ? The great misfortune -isaia- that too many turn a deaf ear and will_not listen to the teachings of this revival of piety . Yet , '' did they but know_the gift of God , '' did they but realise that the greatest of all misfortunes -isaia- to fall away from the World s Redeemer and to abandon Christian faith and practice , they_would be only too eager to turn back , and so escape certain destruction . The most important duty of the Church , and the one most peculiarly her_own , -isaia- to defend and to propagate throughout_the_world the Kingdom of the Son of God , and to bring all men to salvation by communicating to them the divine benefits , so much so that her power and authority are chiefly exercised in this one work . Towards this_end We are conscious of having devoted Our energies throughout Our difficult and anxious Pontificate even to the present_day . And you too , Venerable Brethren , are wont constantly , yea daily , to give your chief thoughts and endeavours together_with Ourselves to the self same task . But -atti_degli_apostoli- the present moment all of us ought to make still further efforts , more especially on the occasion of the Holy Year , to disseminate far and wide the better knowledge and love of Jesus Christ by teaching , persuading , exhorting , if perchance our voice can be heard ; and this , not_so_much to those_who_are ever ready to listen willingly to Christian teachings , but to those most unfortunate men_who , whilst professing the Christian name , live strangers to the faith and love of Christ . For these we feel the profoundest pity : these above all would we urge to think seriously of their present life and what its consequences will be if they_do_not repent . The greatest of all misfortunes -isaia- never to have known Jesus Christ : yet such a state -isaia- free_from the sin of obstinacy and ingratitude . But first to have known Him , and afterwards to deny or forget Him , -isaia- a crime so foul and so insane that it seems impossible for_any man to be guilty of it . For Christ -isaia- the fountain head of all good . Mankind can no more be saved without His power , than it could be redeemed without His mercy . '' Neither -isaia- there salvation in any_other . For there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved '' Acts IV , . What kind of life that_-isaia- from which Jesus Christ , '' the power of God and the wisdom of God , '' -isaia- excluded ; what kind of morality and what manner of death are its consequences , can be clearly learnt from the example of nations deprived of the light of Christianity . Paul s description Romans I . , of the mental blindness , the natural depravity , the monstrous superstitions and lusts of such peoples , our minds will be filled_with horror and pity . What we here record -isaia- well enough known , but_not sufficiently realised or thought about . Pride would_not mislead , nor indifference enervate , so many minds , if the Divine mercies were more generally called to mind and if it were remembered from what an abyss Christ delivered mankind and to what a height He raised it . The human_race , exiled and disinherited , had for ages been daily hurrying into ruin , involved in the terrible and numberless ills brought_about by the sin of our_first parents , nor was there any human hope of salvation , when Christ Our Lord came down as the Saviour from Heaven . At the very_beginning of the world , God had promised Him as the conqueror of '' the Serpent , '' hence , succeeding ages had eagerly looked forward to His coming . The Prophets had long and clearly declared that all hope was in Him . The varying fortunes , the achievements , customs , laws , ceremonies and sacrifices of the Chosen People had distinctly and lucidly foreshadowed the truth , that the salvation of mankind was to be accomplished in Him who should be the Priest , Victim , Liberator , Prince of Peace , Teacher of all Nations , Founder of an Eternal Kingdom . By all these titles , images and prophecies , differing in kind though like in meaning , He alone was designated who '' for His exceeding charity wherewith He loved us , '' gave Himself up for our_salvation . And so , when_the fullness_of_time came in God s Divine Providence , the only_begotten Son of God became man , and in behalf of mankind made most abundant satisfaction in His Blood to the outraged majesty of His Father and by this infinite price He redeemed man for His own . '' You were_not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or silver . but_with the precious Blood of Christ , as of a lamb , unspotted and undefiled '' Peter I . Thus all men , though already subject to His Kingly power , inasmuch as He -isaia- the Creator and Preserver of all , were over and above made His property by a true and real purchase . '' You are_not your_own : for you_are bought with a great price '' Corinthians VI , . Hence in Christ all things_are made new . '' The mystery of His will , according to His good pleasure which He hath purposed to Him , in the dispensation of the fullness of times to re establish all things in Christ '' Ephesians I . When Jesus Christ had blotted out the handwriting of the decree that_was against us , fastening it to the cross , -atti_degli_apostoli- once God s wrath was appeased , the primeval fetters of slavery were struck off from unhappy and erring man , God s favour was won back , grace restored , the gates of Heaven opened , the right to enter them revived , and the means afforded of doing so . Then man , as though awakening from a long continued and deadly lethargy , beheld -atti_degli_apostoli- length the light of the truth , for long ages desired , yet sought in vain . First of all , he realised that he was_born to much higher and more glorious things than the frail and inconstant objects of sense which_had hitherto formed the end of his thoughts and cares . He learnt that the meaning of human_life , the supreme law , the end of all things was this : that we come from God and must return to Him . From this first principle the consciousness of human_dignity was revived : men s hearts realised the universal brotherhood : as a consequence , human rights_and_duties were either perfected or even newly created , whilst on all sides were evoked virtues undreamt of in pagan philosophy . Thus men s aims , life , habits and customs received a new direction . As the knowledge of the Redeemer spread far and wide and His power , which destroyeth ignorance and former vices , penetrated into the very life blood of the nations , such a change came about_that the face of the world was entirely altered by the creation of a Christian civilisation . The remembrance of these events , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- full of infinite joy , but it also teaches us the lesson that we must both feel and render with_our whole hearts gratitude to our Divine Saviour . We are indeed now very far removed in time from the first beginnings of Redemption ; but_what difference does this make when_the benefits thereof are perennial and immortal ? He who once bath restored human_nature ruined by sin the same preserveth and will preserve it for ever . '' He gave Himself a redemption for all '' Timothy II . '' In Christ all shall be made alive '' Corinthians XV . '' And of His Kingdom there shall be no end '' Luke I . Hence by God s eternal decree the salvation of all men , both severally and collectively , depends upon Jesus Christ . Those who abandon Him become guilty by the very_fact , in their blindness and folly , of their_own ruin ; whilst -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they do all that in them lies to bring_about a violent reaction of mankind in the direction of that mass of evils and miseries from which_the Redeemer in His mercy had freed them . Those who go astray from the road wander far from the goal they aim -atti_degli_apostoli- . Similarly , if the pure and true light of truth be rejected , men s minds must necessarily be darkened and their_souls deceived by deplorably false ideas . What hope of salvation can they_have who abandon the very principle and fountain of life ? Christ alone_-isaia- the Way , the Truth and the Life John XIV . If He be abandoned the three necessary conditions of salvation are removed . Christ the Way . It -isaia- surely unnecessary to prove , what experience constantly shows and what each_individual feels in himself , even in the very midst of all temporal prosperity that in God alone_can the human will_find absolute and perfect peace . God -isaia-_the_only end of man . All our life on earth -isaia- the truthful and exact image of a pilgrimage . Now Christ -isaia- the '' Way , '' for we can_never reach God , the supreme and ultimate good , by this toilsome and doubtful road of mortal life , except with Christ as our leader and guide . How so ? Firstly and chiefly by His grace ; but this_would remain '' void '' in man if the precepts of His law were neglected . For , as was necessarily the case after Jesus Christ had won our_salvation , He left behind Him His Law for the protection and welfare of the human_race , under_the_guidance of which men , converted from evil life , might safely tend towards God . '' Going , teach ye all nations . teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you '' Matthew XXVIII . '' Keep my commandments '' John XIV . Hence it will be understood that in the Christian religion the first and most necessary condition -isaia- docility to the precepts of Jesus Christ , absolute loyalty of will towards Him as Lord and King . A serious duty , and one_which oftentimes calls for strenuous labour , earnest endeavour , and perseverance ! For although by Our Redeemer s grace human_nature bath been regenerated , still there remains in each_individual a certain debility and tendency to evil . Various natural appetites attract man on one side and the other ; the allurements of the material world impel his_soul to follow after what_-isaia- pleasant rather_than the law of Christ . Still we must strive our best and resist our natural inclinations with_all_our strength '' unto the obedience of Christ . '' For unless they obey reason they become our masters , and carrying the whole man away from Christ , make him their slave . '' Men of corrupt mind , who have_made shipwreck of the faith , cannot help being slaves . They are slaves to a threefold concupiscence : of will , of pride , or of outward show '' St . Augustine , De Vera Religione , . In this contest every man must be prepared to undergo hardships and troubles for Christ s sake . It -isaia- difficult to reject what so powerfully entices and delights . It -isaia- hard and painful to despise the supposed goods of the senses and of fortune for the will and precepts of Christ our Lord . But the Christian -isaia- absolutely obliged to be firm , and patient in suffering , if he wish to lead a Christian life . Have we forgotten of what Body and of what Head we are the members ? '' Having joy set before Him , He endured the Cross , '' and He bade us deny ourselves . The very dignity of human_nature depends upon this disposition of mind . For , as even the ancient Pagan philosophy perceived , to be master of oneself and to make_the lower part of the soul , obey the superior part , -isaia- so far_from_being a weakness of will that_it_-isaia- really a noble power , in consonance with right_reason and most worthy of a man . Moreover , to bear and to suffer -isaia- the ordinary condition of man . Man can no more create for_himself a life free_from suffering and filled_with all happiness that he can abrogate the decrees of his Divine Maker , who_has willed that the consequences of original_sin should be perpetual . It -isaia- reasonable , therefore , not to expect an end to troubles in this_world , but_rather to steel one s soul to bear troubles , by which_we_are taught to look forward with certainty to supreme happiness . Christ has not promised eternal bliss in heaven to riches , nor to a life of ease , to honours or to power , but to long suffering and to tears , to the love of justice and to cleanness of heart . From this it may clearly be seen what consequences are to be expected from that false pride which , rejecting our Saviour s Kingship , places man -atti_degli_apostoli- the summit of all things and declares that human_nature must rule supreme . And yet , this supreme rule can neither be attained nor even defined . The rule of Jesus Christ derives its form and its power from Divine Love : a holy and orderly charity_-isaia- both its foundation and its crown . Its necessary consequences are the strict fulfilment of duty , respect of mutual rights , the estimation of the things of heaven above those of earth , the preference of the love of God to all things . But this supremacy of man , which openly rejects Christ , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least ignores Him , -isaia- entirely founded upon selfishness , knowing neither charity nor self devotion . Man may indeed be king , through Jesus Christ : but_only on condition that he first of all obey God , and diligently seek his rule of life in God s law . By the law of Christ we mean not_only the natural precepts of morality and the Ancient Law , all of which Jesus Christ has perfected and crowned by His declaration , explanation and sanction ; but_also the rest of His doctrine and His own peculiar institutions . Of these the chief -isaia- His Church . Indeed whatsoever things Christ has instituted are_most fully contained in His Church . Moreover , He willed to perpetuate the office assigned to Him by His Father by means of the ministry of the Church so gloriously founded by Himself . On the one_hand He confided to her all the means of men s salvation , on the other He most solemnly commanded men to be subject to her and to obey her diligently , and to follow her even as Himself : '' He that heareth you , heareth Me ; and he that despiseth you , despiseth Me '' Luke X , . Wherefore the law of Christ must be sought in the Church . Christ -isaia-_man s '' Way '' ; the Church also -isaia-_his '' Way '' Christ of Himself and by His very nature , the Church by His commission and the communication of His power . Hence all who_would find salvation apart_from the Church , are led astray and strive in vain . As with individuals , so with nations . These , too , must necessarily tend to ruin if they go astray from '' The Way . '' The Son of God , the Creator and Redeemer of mankind , -isaia- King and Lord of the earth , and holds supreme dominion over men , both individually and collectively . '' And He gave Him power , and glory , and a kingdom : and all peoples , tribes , and tongues shall serve Him '' Daniel VII . '' I -amos- appointed King by Him . I will_give Thee the Gentiles for Thy inheritance , and the uttermost parts of the earth for Thy possession '' Psalm II . Therefore the law of Christ ought to prevail in human_society and be the guide and teacher of public as well as of private life . Since this_-isaia- so by divine decree , and no man may with impunity contravene it , it -isaia- an evil thing for the common weal wherever Christianity does_not hold the place that belongs to it . When Jesus Christ -isaia- absent , human_reason fails , being bereft of its chief protection and light , and the very end -isaia- lost sight of , for_which , under God s providence , human_society has_been built up . This end -isaia- the obtaining by the members of society of natural good through the aid of civil unity , though always in harmony_with_the perfect and eternal good which_-isaia- above nature . But when men s minds are clouded , both rulers and ruled go astray , for they_have no safe line to follow nor end to aim -atti_degli_apostoli- . Christ the Truth . Just as it -isaia- the height of misfortune to go astray from the '' Way , '' so -isaia- it to abandon the '' Truth . '' Christ Himself -isaia-_the_first , absolute and essential '' Truth , '' inasmuch as He -isaia- the Word of God , consubstantial and co eternal with the Father , He and the Father being One . '' I -amos- the Way and the Truth . '' Wherefore if the Truth be sought by the human intellect , it must first of all submit it to Jesus Christ , and securely rest upon His teaching , since therein Truth itself speaketh . There are innumerable and extensive fields of thought , properly belonging to the human mind , in which it may_have free scope for its investigations and speculations , and that not_only agreeably to its_nature , but_even by a necessity of its_nature . But what_-isaia- unlawful and unnatural -isaia- that the human mind should refuse to be restricted within its_proper limits , and , throwing aside its becoming modesty , should refuse to acknowledge Christ s teaching . This teaching , upon which our_salvation depends , -isaia- almost entirely about God and the things of God . No human wisdom has invented it , but the Son of God hath received and drunk it in entirely from His Father : '' The words_which thou gayest me , have_given to them '' John XVII . Hence this_teaching necessarily embraces many subjects which_are not indeed contrary to reason_for that_would be an impossibility but so exalted that_we_can no more attain them by our_own reasoning than we can comprehend God as He -isaia- in Himself . If there be so many things hidden and veiled by nature , which no human ingenuity can explain , and yet which no man in his senses can doubt , it would be an abuse of liberty to refuse to accept those_which are entirely above nature , because their essence cannot be discovered . To reject dogma -isaia- simply to deny Christianity . Our intellect must bow humbly and reverently '' unto the obedience of Christ , '' so that it be held captive by His divinity and authority : '' bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ '' Corinthians X . Such obedience Christ requires , and justly so . For He -isaia- God , and as such holds supreme dominion over man s intellect as well as over his_will . By obeying Christ with_his intellect man by no means acts in a servile manner , but in complete accordance_with his reason and his natural dignity . For by his_will he yields , not to the authority of any man , but to that of God , the author of his being , and the first principle to Whom he -isaia- subject by the very law of his nature . He does_not suffer himself to be forced by the theories of any human teacher , but by the eternal and unchangeable truth . Hence he attains -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time the natural good of the intellect and his_own liberty . For the truth_which proceeds from the teaching of Christ clearly demonstrates the real nature and value of every being ; and man , being endowed_with this knowledge , if he but obey the truth as perceived , will_make all things subject to himself , not himself to them ; his appetites to his reason , not his reason to his appetites . Thus the slavery of sin and falsehood will be shaken off , and the most perfect liberty attained : '' You shall know_the truth , and the truth shall make you free '' John VIII . It -isaia- , then , evident_that those_whose intellect rejects the yoke of Christ are obstinately striving against God . Having shaken off God s authority , they_are by no means freer , for they_will fall beneath some human sway . They are sure to choose someone whom they_will listen to , obey , and follow as their guide . Moreover , they withdraw their intellect from the communication of divine truths , and thus limit it within a narrower circle of knowledge , so that_they_are less fitted to succeed in the pursuit even of natural science . For there_are in nature very many things whose apprehension or explanation -isaia- greatly aided by the light of divine truth . Not unfrequently , too , God , in order to chastise their pride , does_not permit men to see the truth , and thus they_are punished in the things wherein they sin . This -isaia- why we often see men of great intellectual power and erudition making the grossest blunders even in natural science . It must_therefore be clearly admitted that , in the life of a Christian , the intellect must be entirely subject to God s authority . And if , in this submission of reason to authority , our self love , which_-isaia- so strong , -isaia- restrained and made to suf fez , this only proves the necessity to a Christian of long suffering not_only in will but_also in intellect . We would remind those persons of this_truth who desire a kind of Christianity such as they_themselves have devised , whose precepts should be very mild , much_more indulgent towards human_nature , and requiring little if any hardships to be borne . They do not properly understand_the meaning of faith and Christian precepts . They do not see_that the Cross meets us everywhere , the model of our life , the eternal standard of all who wish to follow Christ in reality and not merely in name . Christ the Life . God alone_-isaia- Life . All other beings partake of life , but are_not life . Christ , from all eternity and by His very nature , -isaia- '' the Life , '' just as He -isaia- the Truth , because He -isaia- God of God . From Him , as from its most_sacred source , all life pervades and ever will pervade creation . Whatever -isaia- , -isaia- by Him ; whatever lives , lives by Him . For by the Word '' all things were made ; and without Him was_made nothing that_was made . '' This -isaia- true of the natural life ; but , as We have sufficiently indicated above , we have a much higher and better life , won for us by Christ s mercy , that_-isaia- to say , '' the life of grace , '' whose happy consummation -isaia- '' the life of glory , '' to which all our_thoughts and actions ought to be directed . The whole object of Christian doctrine and morality -isaia- that '' we being dead to sin , should live to justice '' Peter II . , that_-isaia- , to virtue and holiness . In this consists the moral_life , with the certain hope of a happy eternity . This justice , in order to be advantageous to salvation , -isaia- nourished by Christian faith . '' The just man liveth by faith '' Galatians III . '' Without faith it -isaia- impossible to please God '' Hebrews XI . Consequently Jesus Christ , the creator and preserver of faith , also preserves and nourishes our moral_life . This He does chiefly by the ministry of His Church . To Her , in His wise and merciful counsel , He has_entrusted certain agencies which engender the supernatural life , protect it , and revive it if it should fail . This generative and conservative power of the virtues that make for salvation -isaia- therefore lost , whenever morality -isaia- dissociated from divine faith . A system of morality based exclusively on human_reason robs man of his highest dignity and lowers him from the supernatural to the merely natural life . Not but_that man_-isaia- able by the right use of reason to know and to obey certain principles of the natural_law . But though he should know them all and keep them inviolate through life and even this_-isaia- impossible without_the aid of the grace of our Redeemer still it -isaia- vain for anyone without faith to promise himself eternal_salvation . '' If anyone abide not in Me , he shall be cast forth as a branch , and shall wither , and they_shall gather him up and cast him into the fire , and he burneth '' John XV . '' He that believeth not shall be condemned '' Mark XVI . We have but too much evidence of the value and result of a morality divorced from divine faith . How -isaia- it that , in spite of all the zeal for the welfare of the masses , nations are in such straits and even distress , and that the evil -isaia- daily on the increase ? We are told that society_-isaia- quite able to help itself ; that it can flourish without_the assistance of Christianity , and attain its end by its_own unaided efforts . Public administrators prefer a purely secular system of government . All traces of the religion of our forefathers are daily disappearing from political_life and administration . What blindness ! Once the idea of the authority of God as the Judge of right and wrong -isaia- forgotten , law must necessarily lose its primary authority and justice must perish : and these_are the two most powerful and most necessary bonds of society . Similarly , once the hope and expectation of eternal happiness -isaia- taken away , temporal goods will be greedily sought after . Every man will strive to secure the largest share for_himself . Hence arise envy , jealousy , hatred . The consequences are conspiracy , anarchy , nihilism . There -isaia- neither peace abroad nor security -atti_degli_apostoli- home . Public life_-isaia- stained with crime . So great -isaia- this struggle of the passions and so serious the dangers involved , that we must either anticipate ultimate ruin or seek for an efficient remedy . It -isaia- of course both right and necessary to punish malefactors , to educate the masses , and by legislation to prevent crime in every possible way : but all this_-isaia- by no means sufficient . The salvation of the nations must be looked for higher . A power greater_than human must be called in to teach men s hearts , awaken in them the sense of duty , and make_them better . This -isaia- the power which once before saved the world from destruction when groaning under much_more terrible evils . Once remove all impediments and allow the Christian spirit to revive and grow strong in a nation , and that nation will be healed . The strife between_the classes and the masses will die away ; mutual rights will be respected . If Christ be listened to , both rich and poor will do their_duty . The former will realise that_they must observe justice and charity , the latter self restraint and moderation , if both are to be saved . Domestic life will be firmly established by the salutary fear of God as the Lawgiver . In the same_way the precepts of the natural_law , which dictates respect_for lawful authority and obedience to the laws , will exercise their influence over the people . Seditions and conspiracies will cease . Wherever Christianity rules over all without let or hindrance there the order established by Divine Providence -isaia- preserved , and both security and prosperity are the happy result . The common welfare , then , urgently demands a return to Him from whom we should never have gone astray ; to Him who_-isaia- the Way , the Truth , and the Life , and this on the part not_only of individuals but of society as a whole . We must restore Christ to this His own rightful possession . All elements of the national life must be made to drink in the Life which proceedeth from Him legislation , political institutions , education , marriage and family_life , capital and labour . Everyone must see_that the very growth of civilisation which_-isaia- so ardently desired depends greatly upon this , since_it_-isaia- fed and grows not_so_much by material wealth and prosperity , as by the spiritual qualities of morality and virtue . It -isaia- rather ignorance than ill will which keeps multitudes away from Jesus Christ . There are_many who study humanity and the natural world ; few who study the Son of God . The first step , then , -isaia- to substitute knowledge for ignorance , so that He may no longer be despised or rejected because He -isaia- unknown . We conjure all Christians throughout_the_world to strive all they_can to know their Redeemer as He really -isaia- . The more one contemplates Him with sincere and unprejudiced mind , the clearer does it become that_there can be nothing_more salutary than His law , more divine than His teaching . In this_work , your influence , Venerable Brethren , and the zeal and earnestness of the entire Clergy , can do wonders . You must look upon it as a chief part of your duty to engrave upon the minds of your_people the true knowledge , the very likeness of Jesus Christ ; to illustrate His charity , His mercies , His teaching , by your writings and your words , in schools , in Universities , from the pulpit ; wherever opportunity -isaia- offered you . The world has heard enough of the so called '' rights of man . '' Let it hear something of the rights of God . That the time -isaia- suitable -isaia- proved by the very general revival of religious feeling already referred to , and especially that devotion towards Our Saviour of which_there are so many indications , and which , please God , we shall hand on to the New Century as a pledge of happier times to come . But as this consummation cannot be hoped for except by the aid of divine_grace , let us strive in prayer , with united heart and voice , to incline Almighty God unto mercy , that He would_not suffer those to perish whom He had redeemed by His Blood . May He look down in mercy upon this_world , which_has indeed sinned much , but_which has_also suffered much in expiation ! And , embracing in His loving kindness all races and classes of mankind , may He remember His own words : '' I , if I be lifted up from the earth , will draw all things to Myself John XII . As a pledge of the Divine favours , and in token of Our fatherly affection , we lovingly impart to You , Venerable Brethren , and to your Clergy and People , the Apostolic Blessing . Peter s in Rome , the first day of November , in the rd year of Our Pontificate .
