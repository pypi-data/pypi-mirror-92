CYRIL AND METHODIUS To all the Patriarchs , Primates , Archbishops and Bishops of theCatholic world who enjoy Favor and Communion with the Apostolic See . Venerable Brothers , Greetings and Apostolic Blessing . Cyril and Methodius , Missionaries to the Slavs The great duty of spreading the Christian name was entrusted in a special_way to Peter , the head of the apostles , and to his_successors . It urges the popes to send messengers of the Gospel to the various peoples of the earth , as the affairs of the merciful God demand . For this_reason they sent Augustine to the Britons , Patrick to the Irish , Boniface to the Germans , and Willebrord to the Flemish , Dutch , and Belgians . Often they sent other men to other peoples to care_for their_souls . So in the exercise of their apostolic duty , they commissioned the holy men Cyril and Methodius to go to the Slavic people . Through their presence and more especially through_their labors , those people_have seen the light of the Gospel and have_been led from their barbarian ways to a humane and civilized culture . Extension of the Feast of Cyril and Methodius . All Slovenia has continued to celebrate the work of Cyril and Methodius , well_known peers of the apostles , and the Roman Church has honored both of them_with just as much fervor . The Church honored both of them in many_ways while they lived , and in death it did_not want to be without_the remains of one of them . The Bohemians , Moravians , and Croatians were accustomed to celebrating religious feasts annually on March . Since Pius IX granted them permission to hold their feasts on July and to discharge due prayers in memory of Cyril and Methodius . Not long after that , when_the great council was held -atti_degli_apostoli- the Vatican , many bishops humbly requested from this Apostolic See that_their cult and appointed feast be extended to the whole Church . Until now the matter has_been under study . But because of the change in the status of the government in those areas over the years , it seems like an excellent opportunity to help the people of Slovenia , whose well_being and salvation greatly concern Us . Therefore , We shall not_allow Our paternal love to fail . We wish to promote and increase the devotion to these most_holy men_who once spread the Catholic faith and recalled the Slavic people from ruin to salvation . They now serve as our heavenly advocates and will powerfully defend us . Moreover , in order to bring out more_fully what kind of men We propose for the veneration and worship of the Catholic world , We wish to give a brief history of their deeds . Youth and Cyril s First Mission . The brothers Cyril and Methodius , born in Thessalonica , went as boys to Constantinople in order to study the humanities in the chief city of the East . The spark of genius already discerned in these young_men soon became apparent . They both advanced quickly , especially Cyril , who became so distinguished in learning that he won for_himself the title of '' The Philosopher . '' Soon after this , Methodius undertook the monastic life . Under the influence of the Patriarch Ignatius , the Empress Theodora commissioned Cyril to teach the Christian faith to the Khazer tribes who dwelt beyond_the Chersonese . These people had asked that suitable priests might be sent to them_from Constantinople . Cyril accepted the mission willingly and departed for Tauric Chersonese so that , as some relate , he could study the language of the people . It was -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time that he had the good fortune to discover the remains of Pope Clement I . This courageous martyr was thrown into the sea by order of the Emperor Trajan and was afterwards buried with the anchor to which_he_had been fastened . The anchor , together_with_the ancient tradition , made it very easy to identify the remains . With this priceless treasure , Cyril went into the towns and homes of the Khazars . In a short time , after abolishing many superstitions , he won for Jesus Christ these_people , who_were taught by his_word and moved by the spirit of God . To the new Christian community Cyril gave an example of self control and charity by refusing all the gifts offered to him by the inhabitants , except the slaves whose liberty he restored to them when_they embraced Christianity . He soon returned to Constantinople to enter_the monastery of Polychronius , which Methodius had entered . The Mission to Moravia . Meanwhile , reports of the great events happening among the Khazars reached Rastislav , Prince of Moravia . Aroused by their example , he negotiated with the Emperor Michael III for an evangelizing mission to be sent from Constantinople , and his wish was granted . Thus , the great worth of Cyril and Methodius as seen in their previous accomplishments , together_with their zeal for helping their neighbors , caused their selection for the Moravian mission . As they began their journey through Bulgaria , which_had already_been converted to Christianity , they let pass no opportunity_for increasing the faith . Upon reaching Moravia , they_were met by a large crowd who_had come with_great desire and joy to greet them . Without delay the apostles strove to penetrate their_minds with the doctrines of Christianity and to raise their hopes to heavenly things . They did this with so much force and with_such energetic zeal that in a very short rime the Moravian people gave themselves to Jesus Christ . Much of their success was due to Cyril s knowledge of the Slavic language , which_he_had acquired earlier . The influence of the Old and New Testaments as translated by him into the vernacular was_also considerable . The whole Slavic people owe much to the man_who gave them the Christian faith and with it the advantages of civilization . Cyril and Methodius were also the inventors of the alphabet which afforded the Slavic tongue the means_for a written language , and they_are even looked upon as having formed the language . Another report from_these remote provinces announced to Dome the glory of their deeds . And so , when Pope Nicholas I ordered the brothers to Rome , they obeyed without hesitation . They began their Roman journey quickly , bringing with_them the remains of St . At this news Adrian II , who_was elected to replace the late Pope Nicholas , went out with the clergy and the people to greet the illustrious visitors . Clement was brought with_great portents into the basilica constructed -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of Constantine , in the very tracks of the ancestral home of that invincible martyr . Cyril and Methodius then recounted to the Supreme Pontiff and his clergy the apostolic mission they_had fulfilled with so much holiness and labor . They were accused of acting in opposition to ancient customs and contrary to holy rites in making use of the Slavic language for religious matters . However , they pleaded their cause with_such indisputable and noble reasoning that the pope and all the clergy praised them and approved their course of action . Both then took an oath in the Catholic manner and swore that they_would remain in the faith of St . Peter and of the popes . After that_they were created bishops and consecrated by Adrian himself , and many of their disciples were raised to different grades in Holy Orders . However , it was divine foresight that Cyril should die on February , , more mature in virtue than in age . After a splendid public funeral like that given to popes , he was buried with honors in a tomb which Adrian had built for_himself . Because the Roman people could_not bear to send the holy corpse to Constantinople though his grieving parent asked for it , it was brought to the basilica of St . Clement and buried near him whom Cyril had held in reverence for so many years . As he was taken through the city among festal songs and psalms not_so_much in the manner of a funeral as that of a triumph the Roman people made offerings of heavenly honor to the holy man . Methodius Return to Moravia . After these_things had taken_place , Methodius returned under Papal orders to Moravia as bishop . In that province , having become a spiritual model for his flock , he began to serve Catholicism more keenly every_day . He strongly resisted the factions of reform , lest the Catholic name fall through unsound thinking . He educated prince Svatopluk , who succeeded Rastislav in religious matters . He warned him about shirking his duties , rebuked him , and finally excommunicated him . For these reasons he incurred the anger of that revolting and wicked tyrant ; then he was sent into exile . He was recalled a short time later , and his efforts produced a change of heart in the prince and an understanding that he should return to a new purity of life . It -isaia- remarkable that Methodius vigilant love had crossed the borders of Moravia and reached the Liburnians and Serbs , since he was Cyril s successor . Now it reached the Pannonians , whose prince , Kocel , he disposed to the Catholic religion and retained in his duties . It also reached the Bulgarians , whom he confirmed in the faith along_with their leader Boris . Then he dispensed the gifts of heaven to the Dalmatians . Finally , he worked strenuously that the Carinthians might be brought to the knowledge and the worship of the one true God . Methodius Trip to Rome . But this became a source of trial to Methodius . Some members of the new Christian community became jealous of his accomplishments and virtue . They accused him , to Pope John VIII , Adrian s successor , of being unsound in faith , though he was innocent . They also accused him of violating the traditions of the Fathers who used only the Latin or Greek languages in discharging their religious duties . Wanting to preserve the integrity of the faith and to maintain the ancient traditions , the pope then summoned Methodius to Rome to justify himself . Methodius appeared before Pope John , several bishops , and the Roman clergy in , for he was ever ready to obey and confident in the testimony of his conscience . He obtained an easy victory by proving that he had followed Catholic teachings himself . He showed that he had always taught others the faith which_he_had sworn on the tomb of St . Peter , the prince of the Apostles , an oath given in the presence of Adrian and with_his approval . If he had used the Slavic language in the celebration of the sacraments , he had done so for good reasons , since he had the special permission of Pope Adrian himself and the Holy Scriptures did_not forbid it . Methodius freed himself so completely from every suspicion of guilt that the pope embraced him then and there and confirmed his archiepiscopal jurisdiction and his_mission to the Slavs . Methodius returned to Moravia in the company of several bishops_who were to be his coadjutors , with letters of recommendation and freedom of action in his_work . To confirm those_things , the pope sent letters to Methodius so that he would_not again become subject to the envy of his detractors . For this_reason , Methodius performed his assigned duties more vigilantly , confident that he was joined to the pope and to the whole Roman church in a close bond of faith and love . His labor soon produced an exceptional harvest . With the assistance of a priest , he converted prince Boriwoj of Bohemia , then his wife Ludmilla , and before long Christianity spread throughout that land . At the same_time he brought the light of the Gospel to Poland ; he penetrated Galicia , where he established the episcopal see of Lwdw . Then , as some report , he penetrated into Muscovy and established the episcopal See of Kiev . Having crowned himself_with imperishable laurels , he returned to Moravia and his_own people . He felt his_death approaching and named his successor , and his last words exhorted the clergy_and_people to practice virtue . He departed in peace from this_life , which_had_been the path to heaven for him . As Rome mourned Cyril , so Moravia mourned the loss of Methodius , showing its grief by giving his burial every honor . Papal Concern for the Slavs . Venerable brothers , the memory of these events causes Us great joy . We are deeply moved by the magnificent association of the Slavic nation and the Roman church , an association with the noblest beginnings . Though these_two apostles of the Christian faith went from Constantinople to preach to people in foreign lands , it was from this Apostolic See , the center of Catholic unity , that_they received_the investiture of their_mission or , as happened more_than_once , its solemn approbation . Truly it was here in this city of Rome that_they rendered an account of their_mission and answered their accusers . It was here -atti_degli_apostoli- the tombs of Peter and Paul that_they swore to keep the Catholic faith . It was here that_they received episcopal consecration and the power to establish the sacred hierarchy , while observing in it the distinction of each order . Finally , it was here that_they sought and obtained permission to use the Slavic language in holy rites . This year , ten centuries will_have passed since Pope John VIII wrote to prince Svatopluk of Moravia : '' It -isaia- right that we praise the Slavic language , which re echoes with the praises due to God . We ordain that the proclamations and works of our Lord Jesus Christ should be said in that language . Nothing in true faith , or doctrine forbids us to sing the Mass in the Slavic language , or to read the Gospel lessons correctly translated and interpreted in it , or to chant in it the Divine Hours . '' After many changes , Pope Benedict XIV sanctioned this custom in an apostolic_letter dated August , . Whenever the rulers of the peoples evangelized by Cyril and Methodius asked them , the popes gave generously of their humanity in teaching , kindness in giving advice , and singular good_will wherever possible . Above all , Rastislav , Svatopluk , Kocel , Saint Ludmilla , and Boris have experienced the remarkable love of Our predecessors . The paternal concern of the popes for the Slavic people did_not stop with the death of Cyril and Methodius . Rather , it has_always shone forth in preserving among_them the holiness of religion and public prosperity . In fact , Nicholas I sent priests from Rome to the Bulgarians to educate the people , and he also sent the bishops of Populonia and Ostia to govern_the new Christian community . He gave a loving response in the frequent controversies of the Bulgarians concerning holy law . In this_matter , even_those who_do_not favor the Roman Church praise and admire its prudence . After this calamitous disagreement , We must praise Innocent III for reconciling the Bulgarians with the Catholic Church , and We must praise Gregory IX , Innocent IV , Nicholas IV , and Eugene IV for preserving them in reconciled grace . Similarly the love of Our predecessors shines_forth in their contacts with the Bosnians and Erzevovinenses , who_were deceived by evil opinions . We make special note of Innocent III and Innocent IV , who eradicated this spiritual error , and of Gregory IX , Clement VI , and Pius II who_were eager to establish firmly the levels of sacred authority in those areas . Innocent III , Nicholas IV , Benedict XI , and Clement V conferred neither the last nor the least of their cares on the Serbs , who cunningly prepared deceptions to harm religion , deceptions which_the popes prudently contained . The Dalmatians and the Liburnians received singular favor because of the constancy of their_faith and their changing duties . John X , Gregory VII , Gregory IX , and Urban IV held them up as examples for all . Finally , there_are_many evidences of the good_will of Gregory IX and Clement XIV toward_the church of Sirmium , which_was destroyed in the sixth century by barbarians and later rebuilt through the care of St . Stephen I , king of Hungary . For this_reason , We thank God for giving Us this suitable occasion to thank the Slavic people and to effect a common benefit for them . Indeed We do this no less eagerly than Our predecessors . Certainly We foresee and desire_that the Slavic nation should learn from the great abundance of bishops and priests . May they be strengthened in the profession of the true faith , in true obedience to the Church of Jesus Christ . May they understand more each_day how_great a force of good comes_from_the customs of the Catholic Church in family_life and in all the orders of government . Certainly those churches vindicate the many great cares We showed toward them . There -isaia- nothing We desire more_than to take the appropriate measures for their comfort and prosperity and to have all their relations with Us be in perpetual harmony . This -isaia- the greatest and the best bond of safety . It remains that God , who_-isaia- rich in mercy , might look upon Our plans and favor what We have begun . Meanwhile , We have Cyril and Methodius , the teachers of Slovenia , as intercessors with Him . As We wish to promote their veneration , so We trust in their future heavenly patronage . Therefore , We decree that July be set_aside in the calendar of the universal Roman Church , as Pius IX ordained . On this_day the feast of Sts . Cyril and Methodius shall be celebrated annually with the office and mass proper to a double minor rite , as approved by the holy council . And We entrust to all of you_,_venerable_brothers , the publication of this_letter . Order every priest who celebrates the divine office according to the rites of the Roman Church to observe everything_that -isaia- prescribed in this_letter in each church , province , city , diocese , and monastery . We persuade and encourage you to stimulate prayer to Cyril and Methodius , so that they_might intercede with God and watch over Christianity in the East . May there be constancy in all Catholic men and the will to reconcile all dissidents to the true Church . We order this to be established and fixed as written above , notwithstanding the constitutions of Pope St . Pius V and other apostolic documents on the reform of the breviary and the Roman Missal , or other statutes and customs even very old ones or anything else to the contrary . As a pledge of Our good wishes and of divine favor , venerable_brothers , We lovingly impart Our apostolic_blessing to each_one of you , to all the clergy , and to each_and_every person committed to your_care . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on September , , in the third year of Our Pontificate .
