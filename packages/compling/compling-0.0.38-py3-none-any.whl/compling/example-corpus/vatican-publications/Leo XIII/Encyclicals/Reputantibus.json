As We reflect often on the condition of your churches , it seems to Us that -atti_degli_apostoli- this moment nearly everywhere everything -isaia- full of fear , full of concern . However , this situation -isaia- more_serious in your case because , while Catholicism -isaia- exposed to the hatred and cunning of external enemies , domestic issues also divide it . For while heretics both openly and covertly endeavor to spread error among the faithful , seeds of discord grow daily among Catholics themselves the surest means to hinder strength and break down constancy . Surely the strongest grounds for dissension , especially in Bohemia , are to be found in the languages which each_person , according_to_his origin , employs . For it -isaia- implanted by nature that everyone wishes to preserve the language inherited from his ancestors . To be sure , We have decided to refrain from settling this controversy . Indeed one_cannot find fault with the preservation of one s ancestral tongue , if it -isaia- kept within defined limits . However , what_-isaia- valid for other private rights , must be held to apply here also : namely_,_that the common_good of the nation must_not suffer from their preservation . It -isaia- , therefore , the task of those_who_are in charge of the state to preserve intact the rights of individuals , in such_a_way_that the common_good of the nation be secured and allowed to flourish . As far as We are_concerned , Our duty admonishes Us to take constant care that religion , which_-isaia- the chief good of souls and the source of all other goods , not be endangered by controversies of this nature . Therefore we earnestly exhort your faithful , although of various regions and tongues , to preserve that far more excellent kinship which_-isaia- born from the communion of faith and common sacraments . For whoever are baptized in Christ , have one Lord and one faith ; they_are one_body and one spirit , insofar as they_are_called to one hope . It would be truly disgraceful that_those_who are_bound together by so many holy ties and are seeking the same city in heaven should be torn apart by earthly reasons , rivaling with one_another , as the Apostle says , and hating one_another . Therefore , that kinship of souls which_comes_from Christ must constantly be inculcated in the faithful and all partiality must be eradicated . '' For greater indeed -isaia- the paternity of Christ than_that of blood : for the fraternity of blood touches the likeness only of the body ; the fraternity of Christ , however , conveys unanimity of heart and spirit , as -isaia- written : One was_the heart and one the spirit of the multitude of believers . In this_matter the holy clergy should surpass in example all others . Indeed , it -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with_their office to mingle in such dissensions . If they_should reside in places inhabited by people of different races or languages , unless they abstain from any appearance of contention , they_may easily incur hatred and dislike from both sides . Nothing could be more detrimental to the exercise of their sacred function than_this . The faithful , to be sure , should recognize in fact and practice that the ministers of the Church are_concerned only_with the eternal affairs of souls and do not seek what_-isaia- theirs , but_only what_-isaia- Christ s . If , then , it -isaia- well_known to all alike that the disciples of Christ are recognized by the love that_they_have for one_another , the holy clergy must observe this_same love mutually among_themselves far more . For not_only are they thought , and deservedly so , to have drunk much more_deeply from the charity of Christ , but also_because each_one of them , in addressing the faithful , ought to be able to use the words of the Apostle , '' Be imitators of me , as I -amos- of Christ . We can easily admit that_this_-isaia- very difficult in practice , unless the elements of discord are erased from their_souls -atti_degli_apostoli- an early time_when they , who aspire to the clerical state , are formed in our seminaries . Therefore , you_must diligently see_to_it_that the students in seminaries early learn to love one_another in a fraternal love and from a genuine heart , as those born not from a corruptible seed but an incorruptible one through the word of the living God . Should arguments break out , restrain them strongly and do not_allow them to persist in any_way ; thus those_who_are destined for the clergy , if they_cannot be of one language because of different places of origin , still may certainly be of one heart and one spirit . From this union of wills , indeed , which_must be conspicuous in the clerical order , as we have_already intimated , this advantage among others will follow : that the ministers of the sacraments will more efficaciously warn the faithful not to exceed the limits in preserving and vindicating the rights proper to each race , or by excessive partisanship not to do violence to justice and overlook the common advantages of the state . For we think_that this , according to the circumstances of your various regions , should be the principal task of priests , to exhort the faithful , in season and out , to love one_another ; they_should warn them constantly that_he_-isaia- not worthy of the name of Christian who_does_not fulfill in spirit and action the new command given by Christ that we love one_another as He has loved us . Certainly , he does_not fulfill it , who thinks that charity pertains only to those_who_are related in tongue or race . For if , as Christ says , you love those_who love you , do not the publicans do so ? and if you salute your brothers only , do not the pagans do so ? For to be sure a characteristic of Christian charity_-isaia- that it extends equally to all ; for , as the Apostle warns , there_-isaia- no distinction between Jew and Greek , for there -isaia-_the_same Lord of all , rich to all who invoke him . May God , who_-isaia- Love , kindly grant that all be united in their thoughts and in their convictions , thinking the same and having no contention ; grant that in humility they_may think each_other better_than themselves , each not looking to his_own interests , but to those of others . May the Apostolic blessing , which we grant most lovingly in the Lord , to you , Venerable Brothers , and the faithful committed to each of you , be a token of this and also of Our benevolence .
