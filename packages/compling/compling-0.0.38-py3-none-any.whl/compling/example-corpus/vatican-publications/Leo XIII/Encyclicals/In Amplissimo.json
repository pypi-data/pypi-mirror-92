Certainly We have reason to rejoice , and the Catholic world , on account of itsreverence for the Apostolic See , has reason to rejoice -atti_degli_apostoli- the extraordinary factthat We are to be reckoned as the third in the long line of Roman Pontiffs towhom it has_been happily given to enter upon the twenty fifth year of theSupreme Priesthood . But in this circle of congratulations , while the voices ofall are welcome to Us , that of the bishops and faithful of the United States ofNorth America brings Us special joy , both on account of the conditions whichgive your_country prominence over many_other , and of the special love weentertain for you . You have_been pleased , beloved Son and Venerable Brothers , in your joint letter to Us to mention in detail what , prompted by love for you , We have_done for your churches during the course of Our Pontificate . We on the other_hand , are glad to call to mind the many different_ways in which_you have ministered to Our consolation throughout this period . If We found pleasure in the state of things_which prevailed among_you when We first entered upon the charge of the Supreme Apostolate , now that We have advanced beyond twenty four years in the same charge , We are constrained to confess that Our first pleasure has_never been diminished , but , on the contrary , has increased from day to day by reason of the increase of Catholicity among_you . The cause of this increase , although first of all to be attributed to the providence of God , must_also be ascribed to your energy and activity . You have , in your prudent policy , promoted every_kind of Catholic organization with_such wisdom as to provide_for all necessities and all contingencies , in harmony_with_the remarkable character of the people of your_country . Your chief praise -isaia- that_you have promoted and sedulously continue to foster the union of your churches with this chief of churches and with the Vicar of Christ on earth . Herein , as you rightly confess , -isaia- the apex and centre of government , of teaching and of the priesthood ; the source of that unity_which Christ destined for His Church , and which_-isaia- one_of_the_most striking notes distinguishing it from all human sects . As We have_never failed to exercise with advantage this_most salutary office of teaching and government in every nation , so we have_never permitted that_you or your_people should suffer the lack of it . For We have gladly availed Ourselves of every opportunity to testify the constancy of Our solicitude for you and for the interests of religion among_you . And Our daily experience obliges Us to confess that We have found your_people , through your influence , endowed_with perfect docility of mind and alacrity of disposition . Therefore , while the changes and tendencies of nearly all the nations which_were Catholic for_many centuries give cause for sorrow , the state of your churches , in their flourishing youthfulness , cheers Our heart and fills it with delight . True , you_are shown no special favor by the law of the land , but on the other_hand your lawgivers are certainly entitled to praise for the fact_that they do nothing to restrain you in your just liberty . You must , therefore , and with you the Catholic host behind , make strenuous use of the favorable time for action which_-isaia- now -atti_degli_apostoli- your disposal by spreading abroad as far_as_possible the light of truth against the errors and absurd imaginings of the sects that_are springing up . We are_not unaware , Venerable Brothers , of all that_has_been done by every_one of you for the establishment and the success of schools and academies for the proper education of children . By your zeal in this respect you_have clearly acted in conformity_with_the exhortations of the Apostolic See and the prescriptions of the Council of Baltimore . Your magnificent work on behalf of the ecclesiastical seminaries has assuredly been calculated to increase the prospects of good to be done by the clergy and to add to their_dignity . Nor -isaia- this all . You have wisely taken measures to enlighten dissidents and to draw them to the truth by appointing learned and worthy members of the clergy to go about from district to district to address them in public in familiar style in churches and other buildings , and to solve the difficulties that may be advanced . An excellent plan , and one_which We know has_already borne abundant fruit . Nor has your charity been unmindful of the sad lot of the negro and the Indian you_have sent them teachers , helped them liberally , and you are_most zealously providing for their eternal_salvation . We are glad to add a stimulus , if such be necessary , to enable you to continue these undertakings with full confidence that_your work_-isaia- worthy of commendation . Finally , not to omit the expression of Our gratitude , We would_have you_know what satisfaction you_have caused Us by the liberality with_which your_people are endeavoring to contribute by their offerings to relieve the penury of the Holy See . Many indeed and great are the necessities for_which the Vicar of Christ as supreme Pastor and Father of the Church -isaia- bound to provide in order to avert evil and to promote the faith . Hence your generosity becomes an exercise and a testimony of your faith . For all these reasons We wish to declare to you again_and_again Our affectionfor you . Let the Apostolic blessing , which We bestow most lovingly in the Lordupon you all and upon the flocks entrusted to each_one of you , be taken as atoken of this affection and an augury of divine gifts . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , the fifteenth day of April , , in the twenty fifth year of Our Pontificate .
