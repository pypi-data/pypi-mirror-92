Venerable Brothers , Beloved Sons , Health and Apostolic Benediction . At the end of the year in which , by a singular mercy of God , We have celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of Our priesthood , We dwell with pleasure upon the past months , and are delighted to recall them to memory . And not_without reason ; for the occasion , which regarded Us in a personal manner , was of itself neither great nor extraordinary , and yet moved the goodwill of all men to a very great degree , to rejoice with and congratulate Us , so that_there was nothing left to be desired . This general joy was most pleasing and gratifying to Us ; but_what We valued therein most was_the agreement of sentiment and the universal testimony to religion which it displayed . For the unanimous consent of well wishers expressed this_fact clearly , that in all places the minds and hearts of all were devoted to the Vicar of Christ , that_men looked with confidence to the Apostolic See , in the midst of its misfortunes , as to an ever springing and pure fount of salvation ; and that in every land where_the Catholic religion flourishes the Roman Church , mother and mistress of all Churches , -isaia- duly reverenced , as it should be , with one mind_and_heart . For these reasons , through the past months , We have often lifted up our_eyes to God in thanksgiving for His most gracious gift of long life , and for the consolations in Our labours which We have mentioned , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , when needful , We showed our gratitude to those_to_whom it was due . Now , however , the closing days of the year and of the Jubilee , bid Us renew the recollection of benefits received , and it gives us great pleasure that_the_whole Church joins with Us in thanksgiving . At the same_time We wish by this_letter to declare publicly that so many testimonies of devotion and love have gone very far towards lightening Our burden , and the remembrance of them will live always in Our mind . But a holier and higher duty yet remains . For in this_devotion and eagerness to show honour to the Roman Pontiff , We acknowledge_the power of God Who often -isaia- wont to draw and alone_can draw great good from matters even of the smallest moment . For God , in His providence , seems to have wished to arouse faith in the midst of wrong thinking men , and to recall_the Christian people to the desire of a higher life . We must_therefore strive diligently that after beginning well we may also end well , that the counsels of God may be both understood and put in practice . The obedience shown to the Apostolic See will then be full and perfected , if it be joined with Christian virtue , and thus lead to the salvation_of_souls the only end to be sought for , which_will also abide forever . In the exercise of Our high Apostolic office , bestowed upon Us by the goodness of God , We have many times , as in duty bound , undertaken the defence of truth , and have striven to expound particularly those doctrines which seemed to be most useful to all , in order watchfully and carefully to avoid the dangers of error . But now , as a loving parent , We wish to address all Christians , and in homely words to exhort all to lead a holy life . For beyond_the mere name of Christian , beyond_the mere profession_of_faith , Christian virtues are necessary_for the Christian , and upon this depends , not_only the eternal_salvation of their_souls , but_also the peace and prosperity of the human_family and brotherhood . If We look into the kind of life men lead everywhere , it would be impossible to avoid the conclusion that public_and_private morals differ much from the precepts of the Gospel . Too sadly , alas , do the words of the Apostle St . John apply to our_age , '' all that_-isaia- in the world , -isaia- the concupiscence of the flesh , and the concupiscence of the eyes and the pride of life . '' For in truth , most men , with little care whence they come or whither they go , place all their thoughts and care upon the weak and fleeting goods of this_life ; contrary to nature and right_reason they willingly give themselves up to those ways of which their reason tells them they_should be the masters . It -isaia- a short step from the desire of luxury to the striving after_the means to obtain it . Hence arises an unbridled greed for money , which blinds those_whom it has led captive , and in the fulfilment of its passion hurries them madly along , often without regard for_justice or injustice , and not seldom accompanied by a disgraceful contempt for the poverty of their neighbour . Thus many who_live in the lap of luxury call themselves brethren of the multitude whom in their heart of hearts they despise ; and in the same_way with minds puffed up by pride , they take no thought to obey any law , or fear any power . They call self love liberty , and think themselves '' born free like a wild ass s colt . '' Snares and temptation to sin abound ; We know_that impious or immoral dramas are exhibited on the stage ; that books and journals are written to jeer -atti_degli_apostoli- virtue and ennoble crime ; that the very arts , which_were intended to give pleasure and proper recreation , have been_made to minister to impurity . Nor can We look to the future without fear , for new seeds of evil are sown , and as it were poured into the heart of the rising generation . As for the public schools , there_-isaia- no ecclesiastical authority left in them , and in the years when_it_-isaia- most fitting for tender minds to be trained carefully in Christian virtue , the precepts of religion are for the most part unheard . Men more advanced in age encounter a yet graver peril from evil teaching , which_-isaia- of such a kind as to blind the young by misleading words , instead of filling them_with_the knowledge of the truth . Many now a days seek to learn by the aid of reason alone , laying divine faith entirely aside ; and , through the removal of its bright light , they stumble and fail to discern the truth , teaching for instance , that matter alone exists in the world ; that_men and beasts have_the same origin and a like nature ; there_are_some , indeed , who go so far as to doubt the existence of God , the Ruler and Maker of the World , or who err most grievously , like the heathens , as to the nature of God . Hence the very nature and form of virtue , justice , and duty are of necessity destroyed . Thus it -isaia- that while they hold up to admiration the high authority of reason , and unduly elevate the subtlety of the human intellect , they fall_into the just punishment of pride through ignorance of what_-isaia- of more importance . When the mind has thus been poisoned , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the moral character becomes deeply and essentially corrupted ; and such a state can_only be cured with the utmost difficulty in this class of men , because on the one_hand wrong opinions vitiate their judgment of what_-isaia- right , and on the other the light of Christian faith_,_which -isaia- the principle and basis of all justice , -isaia- extinguished . In this_way We daily see the numerous ills which afflict all classes of men . These poisonous doctrines have utterly corrupted both public_and_private life ; rationalism , materialism , atheism , have begotten socialism , communism , nihilism evil principles_which it was not_only fitting should_have sprung from such parentage but were its necessary offspring . In truth , if the Catholic religion_-isaia- wilfully rejected , whose divine origin -isaia- made clear by such unmistakable signs , what reason -isaia- there why every_form of religion should_not be rejected , not upheld , by such criteria of truth ? If the soul -isaia- one_with the body , and if therefore no hope of a happy eternity remains when_the body dies , what reason -isaia- there for men to undertake toil and suffering here in subjecting the appetites to right_reason ? The highest good of man will then lie in enjoying life s pleasures and life s luxuries . And since there_-isaia- no one_who_-isaia- drawn to virtue by the impulse of his_own nature , every man will naturally lay hands on all he can that_he_may live happily on the spoils of others . Nor -isaia- there any power mighty enough to bridle the passions , for it follows_that the power of law_-isaia- broken , and that all authority_-isaia- loosened , if the belief in an ever living God , Who commands what_-isaia- right and forbids what_-isaia- wrong -isaia- rejected . Hence the bonds of civil_society will be utterly shattered when every man_-isaia- driven by an unappeasable covetousness to a perpetual struggle , some striving to keep their possessions , others to obtain what_they desire . This -isaia- well nigh the bent of our_age . There -isaia- , nevertheless , some consolation for Us even in looking on these evils , and We may lift up Our heart in hope . For God '' created all things_that they_might be : and He made the nations of the earth for health . '' But as all this_world cannot be upheld but by His providence and divinity , so also men can_only be healed by His power , of Whose goodness they_were called from death to life . For Jesus Christ redeemed the human_race once by the shedding of His blood , but the power of so great a work and gift -isaia- for all ages ; '' neither -isaia- there salvation in any_other . '' Hence they_who strive by the enforcement of law to extinguish the growing flame of lawless desire , strive indeed for_justice ; but let_them know that_they_will labor with no result , or next to none , as long as they obstinately reject the power of the gospel and refuse the assistance of the Church . Thus will the evil alone be cured , by changing their ways , and returning back in their public_and_private life to Jesus Christ and Christianity . Now the whole essence of a Christian life_-isaia- to reject the corruption of the world and to oppose constantly any indulgence in it ; this_-isaia- taught in the words and deeds , the laws and institutions , the life and death of Jesus Christ , '' the author and finisher of faith . '' Hence , however strongly We are deterred by the evil disposition of nature and character , it -isaia-_our duty to run to the '' fight proposed to us , '' fortified and armed with the same desire and the same arms as He who , '' having joy set before him , endured the cross . '' Wherefore let men understand this specially , that_it_-isaia- most contrary to Christian duty to follow , in worldly fashion , pleasures of every_kind , to be afraid of the hardships attending a virtuous life , and to deny nothing to self that soothes and delights the senses . '' They that_are Christ s , have crucified their flesh , with the vices and concupiscences '' so that it follows_that they who_are_not accustomed to suffering , and who hold not ease and pleasure in contempt belong not to Christ . By the infinite goodness of God man lived again to the hope of an immortal life , from which_he_had been cut off , but he cannot attain to it if he strives not to walk in the very footsteps of Christ and conform his mind to Christ s by the meditation of Christ s example . Therefore this_-isaia-_not a counsel but a duty , and it -isaia-_the_duty , not of those only who desire a more_perfect life , but clearly of every man '' always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus . '' How otherwise could the natural_law , commanding man to live virtuously , be kept ? For by holy baptism the sin which we contracted -atti_degli_apostoli- birth -isaia- destroyed , but the evil and tortuous roots of sin , which sin has engrafted , and by no means removed . This part of man which_-isaia- without reason although it cannot beat those_who fight manfully by Christ s grace nevertheless struggles with reason_for supremacy , clouds the whole soul and tyrannically bends the will from virtue with_such power that we cannot escape vice or do our_duty except by a daily struggle . '' This holy synod teaches_that in the baptised there remains concupiscence or an inclination to evil , which , being left to be fought against , cannot hurt those who_do_not consent to it , and manfully fight against it by the grace of Jesus Christ ; for he -isaia- not crowned who_does_not strive lawfully . '' There -isaia- in this struggle a degree of strength to which only a very perfect virtue , belonging to those_who , by putting to flight evil passions , has gained so high a place as to seem almost to live a heavenly life on earth . Granted ; grant that few attain such excellence ; even the philosophy of the ancients taught that_every man should restrain his evil desires , and still_more and with_greater care those_who from daily contact_with_the world have_the greater temptations unless it be foolishly thought that where_the danger -isaia- greater watchfulness -isaia- less needed , or that_they who are_more grievously ill need fewer medicines . But the toil which_-isaia- borne in this conflict -isaia- compensated by great blessings , beyond and above heavenly and eternal rewards , particularly in this_way , that by calming the passions nature_-isaia- largely restored to its pristine dignity . For man has_been born under this_law , that the mind should rule_the body , that the appetites should be restrained by sound sense and reason ; and hence it follows_that putting a curb upon our masterful passions -isaia- the noblest and greatest freedom . Moreover , in the present state of society it -isaia- difficult to see what man could be expected to do without such a disposition . Will he be inclined to do well who has_been accustomed to guide his actions by self love alone ? No man can be high souled , kind , merciful , or restrained , who_has not learnt self conquest and a contempt for this_world when opposed to virtue . And yet it must be said_that it seems to have_been pre determined by the counsel of God that there_should be no salvation to men without strife and pain . Truly , though God has_given to man pardon for sin , He gave it under the condition that His only_begotten Son should pay the due penalty ; and although Jesus Christ might have satisfied divine justice in other ways , nevertheless He preferred to satisfy by the utmost suffering and the sacrifice of His life . Thus he has imposed upon His followers this_law , signed in His blood , that_their life should be an endless strife with the vices of the age . What made the apostles invincible in their_mission of teaching truth to the world ; what strengthened the martyrs innumerable in their bloody testimony to the Christian faith , but the readiness of their soul to obey fearlessly His laws ? And all who have_taken heed to live a Christian life and seek virtue have trodden the same path ; therefore We must walk in this_way if We desire either Our own salvation or that of others . Thus it becomes necessary_for every_one to guard manfully against the allurements of luxury , and since on every side there_-isaia- so much ostentation in the enjoyment of wealth , the soul must be fortified against the dangerous snares of riches lest straining after what are_called the good things of life_,_which cannot satisfy and soon fade away , the soul should lose '' the treasure in heaven which faileth not . '' Finally , this_-isaia- matter of deep grief , that free thought and evil example have so evil an influence in enervating the soul , that_many are_now almost ashamed of the name of Christian a shame which_-isaia- the sign either of abandoned wickedness or the extreme of cowardice ; each detestable and each of the highest injury to man . For what salvation remains for_such men , or on what hope can they rely , if they cease to glory in the name of Jesus Christ , if they openly and constantly refuse to mould their_lives on the precepts of the gospel ? It -isaia- the common complaint that the age -isaia- barren of brave men . Bring back a Christian code of life , and thereby the minds_of_men will regain their firmness and constancy . But man s power by itself_-isaia- not equal to the responsibility of so many duties . As We must ask God for daily bread for the sustenance of the body , so must We pray to Him for strength of soul for its nourishment in virtue . Hence that universal condition and law of life_,_which We have_said -isaia- a perpetual battle , brings with it the necessity of prayer to God . For , as -isaia- well and wisely said by St . Augustine , pious prayer flies over the world s barriers and calls down the mercy of God from heaven . In order to conquer the emotions of lust , and the snares of the devil , lest we should be led into evil , we are commanded to seek the divine help in the words , '' pray that ye enter not into temptation . '' How much_more -isaia- this necessary , if we wish to labour for the salvation of others ? Christ our Lord , the only_begotten Son of God , the source of all grace and virtue , first showed by example what he taught in word : '' He passed the whole night in the prayer of God , '' and when nigh to the sacrifice of his_life , '' He prayed the longer . The frailty of nature would be much less fearful , and the moral character would grow weak and enervated with much less ease if that divine precept were not_so_much disregarded and treated almost with disdain . For God -isaia- easily appeased , and desires to aid men , having promised openly to give His grace in abundance to those_who ask for it . Nay , He even invites men to ask , and almost insists with most loving words : '' I say unto you , ask and it shall be given you : seek , and you shall find : knock , and it shall be opened to you . '' And that_we_should have no fear in doing this with confidence and familiarity , he softens His words , comparing Himself to a most loving father_who desires nothing so much as the love of his_children . '' If you then being evil , know_how to give good gifts to your children : how much_more wild your Father who_-isaia- in heaven , give good things to them that ask Him ? '' And this_will not seem excessive to one_who considers it , if the efficaciousness of prayer seemed so great to St . John Chrysostom that he thought it might be compared with the power of God ; for as God created all things by His word , so man by prayer obtains what he wills . For nothing has so great a power as prayer , because in it there_are certain qualities with_which it pleases God to be moved . For in prayer we separate ourselves from things of earth , and filled_with_the thought of God alone , we become aware of our human weakness ; for the same reason we rest in the embrace of our Father , we seek a refuge in the power of our Creator . We approach the Author of all good , as though we wish Him to gaze upon our weak souls , our failing strength , our poverty ; and , full of hope , we implore His aid and guardianship , Who alone_can give help to the weak and consolation to the infirm and miserable . With such a condition of mind , thinking but little of ourselves , as -isaia- fitting , God -isaia- greatly inclined to mercy , for God resisteth the proud , but to the humble he giveth grace . Let , then , the habit of prayer be sacred to all ; let soul and voice join together in prayer , and let our whole daily_life agree together , so that , by keeping the laws of God , the course of our days may seem a continual ascent to Him . The virtue of which we speak , like the others , -isaia- produced and nourished by divine faith ; for God -isaia- the Author of all true blessings that_are to be desired for themselves , as we owe to Him our knowledge of His infinite goodness , and our knowledge of the merits of our Redeemer . But , again , nothing_-isaia- more fitted for the nourishment of divine faith than the pious habit of prayer , and the need of it -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time -isaia- seen by its weakness in most , and its absence in many men . For that virtue -isaia-_especially the source whereby not_only private lives may be amended , but_also from which a final judgment may be looked for in those matters which in the daily conflict of men do not permit states to live in peace and security . If the multitude -isaia- frenzied with a thirst_for excessive liberty , if the inhuman lust of the rich never -isaia- satisfied , and if to these be added those evils of the same kind to which We have referred fully above , it will be found that_nothing can heal them more completely or fully than Christian faith . Here it -isaia- fitting We should exhort you whom God has made His helpers by giving the divine power to dispense His Sacraments , to turn to meditation and prayer . If the reformation of private and public morals -isaia- needed , it scarcely requires to be said_that in both respects the clergy ought to set the highest example . Let them therefore remember that_they_have been_called by Jesus Christ , '' the light_of_the_world , that the soul of the priest should shine like a light illuminating the whole_world . '' The light of learning , and that in no small degree -isaia- needed in the priest , because_it_-isaia- his duty , to fill others with wisdom , to destroy errors , to be a guide to the many in the steep and slippery paths of life . Learning ought to be accompanied by innocence of life , because in the reformation of man example -isaia- far better_than precept . '' Let your light shine before men , that_they_may see your good_works . '' The meaning of the divine word_-isaia- that the perfection of virtue in priests should be such that_they_should be like a mirror to the rest of men . '' There -isaia- nothing which induces others more_effectively to piety and the worship of God , than the life and example of those_who_have dedicated themselves to the divine ministry : for , since_they are separated_from the world and placed in a higher sphere , others look on them as though on a mirror , to take examples from them . '' Therefore if all men must watchfully heed against the allurements of sin , and against seeking too eagerly fleeting pleasures , it -isaia- clear how much_more faithful and steadfast ought priests to be . The sacredness of their_dignity , moreover as well as the fact that_it_-isaia- not sufficient to restrain their passions demands in them the habit of stringent self restraint , and also a guard over the powers of the soul , particularly the intellect and will , which hold the supreme place in man . '' Thou who bast the mind to leave all says St . Bernard , remember to reckon thyself among what thou would st abandon nay , deny thyself first and before everything . '' Not before the soul -isaia- unshackled and free_from every desire , will men_have a generous zeal for the salvation of others , without_which they_cannot properly secure their_own everlasting welfare . '' There will be one_thing only sought says St . Bernard by His subjects , one glory , one pleasure to make ready for the Lord a perfect people . For this they_will give everything with much exertion of mind and body , with toil and suffering , with hunger and thirst , with cold and nakedness . '' The frequent meditation upon the things of heaven wonderfully nourishes and strengthens virtue of this_kind , and makes it always fearless of the greatest difficulties for the good of others . The more pains they take to meditate well , the more_clearly will they understand_the greatness and holiness of the priestly office . They will understand how sad it -isaia- that so many men , redeemed by Jesus Christ , are running headlong to eternal ruin ; and by meditation upon God they_will be themselves encouraged , and will more effectually excite others to the love of God . Such , then , -isaia- the surest method for the salvation of all ; and in this men must_take heed not to be terrified by difficulties , and not to despair of cure by reason of the long continuance of the evil . The impartial and unchangeable justice of God metes out reward for good deeds and punishment for sin . But since_the life of peoples and nations , as such , does_not outlast their world , they necessarily receive the rewards due to their deeds on this earth . Indeed it -isaia- no new thing that prosperity should come to a wrong doing state ; and this by the just counsel of God , Who from time to time rewards good actions with prosperity , for no people -isaia- altogether without merit , and this Augustine considered was_the case with the Roman people . The law , nevertheless , -isaia- clear_that for public prosperity it -isaia- to the interest of all that virtue and justice especially , which_-isaia- the mother of all virtues should be practised , '' Justice exalteth a nation ; but sin maketh nations miserable . '' It -isaia- not Our purpose here to consider how far evil deeds may prosper , not whether empires , when flourishing and managing matters to their_own liking , do nevertheless carry about with_them , as it were shut up in their bowels , the seed of ruin and wretchedness . We wish this one_thing to be understood , of which history has innumerable examples , that injustice -isaia- always punished , and with_greater severity the longer it has_been continued . We are greatly consoled by the words of the Apostle Paul , '' For all things_are yours ; and you_are Christ s , and Christ -isaia- God s . '' By the hidden dispensation of divine_providence the course of earthly things -isaia- so guided that all things_that happen to man turn out to the glory of God for the salvation of those_who_are true disciples of Jesus Christ . Of these the mother and guide , the leader and guardian -isaia- the Church ; which being united to Christ her spouse in intimate and unchangeable charity_-isaia- also joined to Him by a common cause of battle and of victory . Hence We are_not , and cannot be anxious on account of the Church , but We greatly fear for the salvation of very many , who proudly despise the Church , and by every_kind of error rush to ruin ; We are_concerned for those States which We cannot_but see are turned from God and sleeping in the midst of danger in dull security and insensibility . '' Nothing -isaia- equal to the Church ; '' says St . John Chrysostom , '' how_many have opposed the Church and have themselves perished ? The Church reaches to the heavens ; such_-isaia- the Church s greatness . She conquers when attacked ; when beset by snares she triumphs ; she struggles and -isaia- not overthrown , she fights and -isaia- not conquered . '' Not only -isaia- she not conquered , but she preserves that corrective power over nature , and that effective strength of life_that springs from God Himself , and -isaia- unchanged by time . And , if by this_power she_has freed the world grown old in vice and lost in superstition , why should she not again recover it when gone astray ? Let strife and suspicion -atti_degli_apostoli- length cease , let all obstacles be removed , give the possession of all her rights to the Church , whose duty it -isaia- to guard and spread abroad the benefits gained by Jesus Christ , then We shall know by experience , where_the light of the Gospel -isaia- , and what_the power of Christ can do . This year , which_-isaia- now coming to an end , has_given , as We have_said , many signs of a reviving faith . Would that like the spark it might grow to an ever_increasing flame , which , by burning up the roots of sin , may open a way_for the restoration of morals and for salutary counsels . We , indeed , who steer the mystical barque of the Church in such a storm , fix Our mind_and_heart upon the Divine Pilot Who holds the helm and sits unseen . Thou seest , Lord , how the winds have borne down on every side , how the sea rages and the waves are lashed to fury . Command , we beseech Thee , Who alone canst , the winds and the sea . Give back to man that tranquillity and order_that true peace which_the world cannot give . By Thy grace let man be restored to proper order with_faith in God , as in duty bound , with justice and love towards our neighbour , with temperance as to ourselves , and with passions controlled by reason . Let Thy kingdom come , let_the duty of submitting to Thee and serving Thee be learnt by those_who , far from Thee , seek truth and salvation to no purpose . In Thy laws there_-isaia- justice and fatherly kindness ; Thou grantest of Thy own good_will the power to keep them . The life of a man on earth -isaia- a warfare , but Thou lookest down upon the struggle and helpest man to conquer , Thou raisest him_that falls , and crownest him_that triumphs . With a mind upheld by these thoughts to cherish a joyful and firm hope , as a pledge of the favours of Heaven and of Our good_will , We most lovingly in the Lord grant to you , Venerable Brethren , and to the clergy_and_people of the whole Catholic world , the Apostolic blessing . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the birthday of Our Lord Jesus Christ ; in the year ; the eleventh of Our Pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .
