When by God s unsearchable design , We , though all unworthy , were raised to the height of apostolic dignity , -atti_degli_apostoli- once We felt Ourselves moved by an urgent desire and , as it were , necessity , to address you by letter , not merely to express to you Our very deep feeling of love , but further , in accordance_with_the task entrusted to Us from heaven , to strengthen you_who are_called to share Our solicitude , that_you_may help Us to carry on the battle now being waged on behalf of the Church of God and the salvation_of_souls . For , from the very_beginning of Our pontificate , the sad sight has presented itself to Us of the evils by which_the human_race -isaia- oppressed on every side : the widespread subversion of the primary truths on which , as on its foundations , human society_-isaia- based ; the obstinacy of mind_that will_not brook any authority however lawful ; the endless sources of disagreement , whence arrive civil strife , and ruthless war and bloodshed ; the contempt of law which molds characters and -isaia- the shield of righteousness ; the insatiable craving for things perishable , with complete forgetfulness of things eternal , leading up to the desperate madness whereby so many wretched beings , in all directions , scruple not to lay violent hands upon themselves ; the reckless mismanagement , waste , and misappropriation of the public funds ; the shamelessness of those_who , full of treachery , make semblance of being champions of country , of freedom , and every_kind of right ; in fine , the deadly kind of plague which infects in its inmost recesses , allowing it no respite and foreboding ever fresh disturbances and final disaster . Now , the source of these evils lies chiefly , We are convinced , in this , that_the_holy and venerable authority of the Church , which in God s name rules mankind , upholding and defending all lawful authority , has_been despised and set_aside . The enemies of public order , being fully aware of this , have thought nothing better suited to destroy the foundations of society than to make an unflagging attack upon the Church of God , to bring her into discredit and odium by spreading infamous calumnies and accusing her of being opposed to genuine progress . They labor to weaken her influence and power by wounds daily inflicted , and to overthrow the authority of the Bishop of Rome , in whom_the abiding and unchangeable principles of right and good find_their earthly guardian and champion . From these causes have originated laws that shake the structure of the Catholic Church , the enacting whereof we have to deplore in so many lands ; hence , too , have floured forth contempt of episcopal authority ; the obstacles thrown in the way of the discharge of ecclesiastical duties ; the dissolution of religious bodies ; and the confiscation of property that_was once the support of the Church s ministers and of the poor . Thereby , public institutions , vowed to charity and benevolence , have_been withdrawn from the wholesome control of the Church ; thence , also , has arisen that unchecked freedom to teach and spread abroad all mischievous principles , while the Church s claim to train and educate youth -isaia- in every way outraged and baffled . Such , too , -isaia- the purpose of the seizing of the temporal power , conferred many centuries ago by Divine Providence on the Bishop of Rome , that_he_might without let or hindrance use the authority conferred by Christ for the eternal welfare of the nations . We have recalled to your minds , venerable_brothers , this deathly mass of ills , not to increase the sorrow naturally caused by this_most sad state of things , but because we believe_that from its consideration you will most plainly see_how serious are the matters claiming our attention as well as devotedness , and with what energy We should work and , more_than_ever , under the present adverse conditions , protect , so far as in Us lies , the Church of Christ and the honor of the apostolic_see the objects of so many slanders and assert their claims . It -isaia- perfectly clear and evident , venerable_brothers , that the very notion of civilization -isaia- a fiction of the brain if it rest not on the abiding principles of truth and the unchanging laws of virtue and justice , and if unfeigned love knit not together the wills of men , and gently control the interchange and the character of their mutual service . Now , who_would make bold to deny that the Church , by spreading the Gospel throughout_the nations , has brought the light of truth amongst people utterly savage and steeped in foul superstition , and has quickened them alike to recognize_the Divine Author of nature and duly to respect themselves ? Further , who_will deny that the Church has done away with the curse of slavery and restored men to the original dignity of their noble nature ; and by uplifting the standard of redemption in all quarters of the globe , by introducing , or shielding under her protection , the sciences and arts , by founding and taking_into her keeping excellent charitable institutions which provide relief for ills of every_kind has throughout_the_world , in private or in public_life , civilized the human_race , freed it from degradation , and with all care trained it to a way of Living such as befits the dignity and the hopes of man ? And if any_one of sound mind compare the age in which We live , so hostile to religion and to the Church of Christ , with_those happy times when_the Church was revered as a mother by the nations , beyond all question he will see_that our epoch -isaia- rushing wildly along the straight road to destruction ; while in those times which most abounded in excellent institutions , peaceful life , wealth , and prosperity the people showed themselves most obedient to the Church s rule and laws . Therefore , if the many blessings We have mentioned , due to the agency and saving help of the Church , are the true and worthy outcome of civilization , the Church of Christ , far_from_being alien to or neglectful of progress , has a just claim to all men s praise as its nurse , its mistress , and its mother . Furthermore , that kind of civilization which conflicts with the doctrines and laws of holy Church -isaia- nothing but a worthless imitation and meaningless name . Of this those peoples on whom_the Gospel light has_never shown afford ample proof , since in their mode of life a shadowy semblance only of civilization -isaia- discoverable , while its true and solid blessings have_never been possessed . Undoubtedly , that cannot by any means be accounted the perfection of civilized life_which sets all legitimate authority boldly -atti_degli_apostoli- defiance ; nor_can that be regarded as liberty which , shamefully and by the vilest means , spreading false principles , and freely indulging the sensual gratification of lustful desires , claims impunity for all crime and misdemeanor , and thwarts the goodly influence of the worthiest citizens of whatsoever class . Delusive , perverse , and misleading as are these_principles , they_cannot possibly have any inherent power to perfect the human_race and fill it with blessing , for '' sin maketh nations miserable . '' Such principles , as a matter of course , must hurry nations , corrupted in mind_and_heart , into every_kind of infamy , weaken all right order , and thus , sooner or later , bring_the standing and peace of the State to the very brink of ruin . Again , if We consider_the achievements of the see of Rome , what can be more wicked than to deny how_much and how well the Roman bishops have served civilized society -atti_degli_apostoli- large ? For Our predecessors , to provide_for the peoples good , encountered struggles of every_kind , endured to the utmost burdensome toils , and never hesitated to expose themselves to most dangerous trials . With eyes fixed on heaven , they neither bowed down their head before the threats of the wicked , nor allowed themselves to be led by flattery or bribes into unworthy compliance . This apostolic chair it was that gathered and held together the crumbling remains of the old order of things ; this_was the kindly light by whose help the culture of Christian times shone far and wide ; this_was an anchor or safety in the fierce storms by which_the human_race has_been convulsed ; this_was the sacred bond of union that linked together nations distant in region and differing in character ; in short , this_was a common center from which_was sought instruction in faith and religion , no less_than guidance and advice for the maintenance of peace and the functions of practical life . In very truth it -isaia- the glory of the supreme Pontiffs that_they steadfastly set themselves up as a wall and a bulwark to save human_society from falling back into its former superstition and barbarism . Would that_this healing authority had never been slighted or set_aside ! Assuredly , neither would the civil_power have lost that venerable and sacred glory , the lustrous gift of religion , which alone renders the state of subjection noble and worthy of man ; nor would so many revolutions and wars have_been fomented to ravage the world with desolation and bloodshed ; nor would kingdoms , once so flourishing , but now fallen from the height of prosperity , lie crushed beneath the weight of every_kind of calamity . Of this_the peoples of the East also furnish an example , who , by breaking the most sweet yoke that bound them to this_apostolic_see , forfeited the splendor of their former greatness , their renown in science and art , and the dignity of their sway . Of these remarkable benefits , however , which illustrious monuments of all ages prove to have flowed upon every quarter of the world from the apostolic_see , this land of Italy has had the most abounding experience . For it has derived advantages from the see of Rome proportionate to the greater nearness of its natural situation . Unquestionably , to the Roman Pontiffs it -isaia- that Italy must own herself indebted for the substantial glory and majesty by which_she has_been preeminent amongst nations . The influence and fatherly care of the Popes have upon many occasions shielded her from hostile attack and brought her relief and aid , the effect of which_-isaia- that the Catholic faith_has been ever maintained inviolate in the hearts of Italians . These services of Our predecessors , to omit mention of many_others , have_been witnessed to in a special manner by the records of the times of St . Leo the Great , Alexander III , Innocent III , St . Pius V , Leo X , and other Pontiffs , by whose exertions or protection Italy has escaped unscathed from the utter destruction threatened by barbarians ; has kept unimpaired her old faith , and , amid the darkness and defilement of the ruder age , has cultivated and preserved in vigor the luster of science and the splendor of art . To this , furthermore , bears_witness Our own fostering city , the home of the Popes , which , under their rule , reaped this special benefit , that it not_only was_the strong citadel of the faith , but_also became the refuge of the liberal arts and the very abode of wisdom winning for itself the admiration and respect of the whole_world . As these facts in all their amplitude have_been handed_down in historical records for the perpetual remembrance of posterity , it -isaia- easy to understand that_it_-isaia- only_with hostile design and shameless calumny meant to mislead men that any_one can venture in speech and in writing to accuse the apostolic_see of being an obstacle to the civil progress of nations and to the prosperity of Italy . Seeing , therefore_,_that all the hopes of Italy and of the whole_world lie in the power , so beneficent to the common_good and profit , wherewith the authority of the apostolic_see -isaia- endowed , and in the close union which binds all the faithful of Christ to the Roman Pontiff , We recognize_that nothing should be nearer Our heart than how to preserve safe and sound the dignity of the Roman see , and to strengthen ever more_and_more the union of members with the head , of the children with_their father . Wherefore , that We may above all things , and in every possible way , maintain the rights and freedom of this_holy see , We shall never cease to strive that Our authority may meet with due deference ; that obstacles may be removed which hamper the free exercise of Our ministry and that We may be restored to that condition of things in which_the design of God s wisdom had long ago placed the Roman Pontiffs . We are moved to demand this restoration , venerable_brethren , not by any feeling of ambition or desire of supremacy , but by the nature of Our office and by Our sacred promise confirmed on oath ; and further , not only_because this sovereignty -isaia- essential to protect and preserve the full liberty of the spiritual power , but_also because_it_-isaia- an ascertained fact_that , when_the temporal sovereignty of the apostolic_see -isaia- in question , the cause of the public good and the well_being of all human_society in general are_also -atti_degli_apostoli- stake . Hence , We cannot omit , in the discharge of Our duty , which obliges Us to guard the rights of holy Church , to renew and confirm in every particular by this Our letter those declarations and protests which Pius IX , of sacred memory , Our predecessor , on many and repeated occasions published against the seizing of the civil sovereignty and the infringement of rights belonging to the Catholic Church . At the same_time We address ourselves to princes and chief rulers of the nations , and earnestly beseech them in the august name of the Most High God , not to refuse the Church s aid , proffered them in a season of such need , but_with united and friendly aims , to join themselves to her as the source of authority and salvation , and to attach themselves to her more_and_more in the bonds of hearty love and devotedness . God grant that seeing the truth of Our words and considering within themselves that the teaching of Christ -isaia- , as Augustine used to say , '' a great blessing to the State , if obeyed , '' and that_their own peace and safety , as well as that of their_people , -isaia- bound up with the safety of the Church and the reverence due to her they_may give their whole thought and care to mitigating the evils by which_the Church and its visible head are harassed , and so it may -atti_degli_apostoli- last come to pass that the peoples whom_they govern may enter on the way of justice_and_peace , and rejoice in a happy era of prosperity and glory . In the next place , in order_that the union of hearts between their chief Pastor and the whole Catholic flock may daily be strengthened , We here call_upon you_,_venerable_brothers , with particular earnestness , and strongly urge you to kindle , with priestly zeal and pastoral_care , the fire of the love of religion among the faithful entrusted to you , that_their attachment to this chair of truth and justice may_become closer and firmer , that_they_may welcome all its teachings with thorough assent of mind and will , wholly rejecting such opinion , even_when most widely received , as they know to be contrary to the Church s doctrine . In this_matter , the Roman Pontiffs , Our predecessors , and the last of all , Pius IX , of sacred memory , especially in the General Council of the Vatican , have_not neglected , so often as there_was need , to condemn widespreading errors and to smite them_with_the apostolic condemnation . This they did , keeping before their_eyes the words of St . Paul : '' Beware lest any man cheat you by philosophy and vain deceit , according to the tradition of men , according to the elements of the world and not according to Christ . '' All such censures , We , following in the steps of Our predecessors , do confirm and renew from this_apostolic seat of truth , whilst We earnestly ask of the Father of lights that all the faithful , brought to thorough agreement in the like feeling and the same belief , may think and speak even as Ourselves . It -isaia- your duty , venerable_brothers , sedulously to strive that the seed of heavenly doctrine be sown broadcast in the field of God , and that the teachings of the Catholic faith may be implanted early in the souls of the faithful , may strike deep root in them , and be kept free_from the ruinous blight of error . The more the enemies of religion exert themselves to offer the uninformed , especially_the young , such instruction as darkens the mind and corrupts morals , the more actively should we endeavor that not_only a suitable and solid method of education may flourish but_above all that_this education be wholly in harmony_with_the Catholic faith in its literature and system of training , and chiefly in philosophy , upon which_the direction of other sciences in great measure depends . Philosophy seeks not the overthrow of divine_revelation , but delights rather to prepare its way , and defend it against assailants , both by example and in written works , as the great Augustine and the Angelic Doctor , with all other teachers of Christian wisdom , have proved to Us . Now , the training of youth most conducive to the defense of true faith and religion and to the preservation of morality must find its beginning from an early stage within_the circle of home life ; and this family Christian training sadly undermined in these our_times , cannot possibly be restored to its due dignity , save by those laws under which it was established in the Church by her Divine Founder Himself . Our Lord Jesus Christ , by raising to the dignity of a sacrament the contract of matrimony , in which He would_have His own union with the Church typified , not_only made the marriage tie more holy , but , in addition , provided efficacious sources of aid for parents and children alike , so that , by the discharge of their_duties one to another , they_might with_greater ease attain to happiness both in time and in eternity . But when impious laws , setting -atti_degli_apostoli- naught the sanctity of this_great sacrament , put it on the same footing of mere civil contracts , the lamentable result followed , that , outraging the dignity of Christian matrimony , citizens made use of legalized concubinage in place of marriage ; husband_and_wife neglected their bounden duty to each_other ; children refused obedience and reverence to their_parents ; the bonds of domestic love were loosened ; and alas ! the worst scandal and of all the most ruinous to public morality , very frequently an unholy passion opened the door to disastrous and fatal separations . These most unhappy and painful consequences , venerable_brothers , cannot_fail to arouse your zeal and move you constantly and earnestly to warn the faithful committed to your charge to listen with docility to your teaching regarding the holiness of Christian marriage , and to obey laws by which_the Church controls the duties of married people and of their offspring . Then , indeed , will that_most desirable result come about , that the character and conduct of individuals also will be reformed ; for , just as from a rotten stock are produced healthless branches or worthless fruits , so do the ravages of a pestilence which ruins the household spread wide their cruel infection to the hurt and injury of individual citizens . On the other_hand , when domestic society_-isaia- fashioned in the mould of Christian life , each member will gradually grow accustomed to the love of religion and piety , to the abhorrence of false and harmful teaching , to the persuit of virtue , to obedience to elders , and to the restraint of the insatiable seeking after self interest alone , which so spoils and weakens the character of men . To this_end it will certainly help not a little to encourage and promote those pious associations which_have_been established , in our_own times especially , with so great profit to the cause of the Catholic religion . Great indeed and beyond_the strength of man are these objects of our hopes and prayers , venerable_brothers ; but , since God has '' made the nations of the earth for health , '' when He founded the Church for the welfare of the peoples , and promised that He will abide with_her by His assistance to the end of the world , We firmly trust that , through your endeavors , the human_race , taking warning from so many evils and visitations , will submit themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- length to the Church , and turn for health and prosperity to the infallible guidance of this_apostolic_see . Meanwhile , venerable_brothers , before bringing this_letter to a close , We must express Our congratulations on the striking harmony and concord which unites your minds among yourselves and with this_apostolic_see . This perfect union We regard as not merely an impregnable bulwark against hostile attacks , but_also as an auspicious and happy omen , presaging better times for the Church ; and , while it yields great relief to Our weakness , it seasonably encourages Us to endure with readiness all labors and all struggles on behalf of God s Church in the arduous task which We have undertaken . Moreover , from the causes of hope and rejoicing which We have made_known to you We cannot separate those tokens of love and obedience which you_,_venerable_brethren , in these first days of Our pontificate , have shown Our lowliness , and with you so many of the clergy and the faithful , who by letters sent , by offerings given , by pilgrimages undertaken , and by other works of love , have_made it clear_that the devotion and charity_which they manifested to Our most worthy predecessor still lasts , so strong and steadfast and unchanged as not to slacken toward_the person of a successor so much inferior . For these splendid tokens of Catholic piety We humbly confess to the Lord that He -isaia- good and gracious , while to you_,_venerable_brothers , and to all Our beloved_children from whom We have_received them , We publicly , from the bottom of Our heart , avow the grateful feelings of Our soul , cherishing the fullest confidence that , in the present critical state of things and in the difficulties of the times , this your devotion and love and the devotion and love of the faithful will_never fail Us . Nor have We any doubt_that these conspicuous examples of filial piety and Christian virtue will be of such avail as to make Our most merciful God , moved by these dutiful deeds , look with favor on His flock and grant the Church peace and victory . But as We are sure_that this peace and victory will more quickly and more readily be given Us , if the faithful_are unremitting in their prayers and supplications to obtain it , We earnestly exhort you_,_venerable_brothers , to stir up for_this end the zeal and ardor of the faithful , taking the Immaculate Queen of Heaven as their intercessor with God , and having recourse as their advocates to St . Joseph , the heavenly patron of the Church , and to Sts . Peter and Paul , the Princes of the Apostles . To the powerful patronage of all these We humbly commit Our lowliness , all ranks of the ecclesiastical hierarchy , and all the flock of Christ our Lord . For the rest , We trust that_these days , on which We renew the memory of Jesus Christ , risen from the dead , may be to you_,_venerable_brothers , and to all the fold of God , a source of blessing and salvation and fullness of holy joy , praying our most gracious God that by the blood of the Lamb without spot , which blotted out the handwriting that_was against Us , the sins We have committed may be washed away , and the judgment We are suffering for them may mercifully be mitigated . '' The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , and the Charity of God , and the communication of the Holy Spirit be with you all , '' venerable_brothers ; to each and all of whom , as well as to Our beloved_children , the clergy and faithful of your churches , as a pledge of Our special good_will and as an earnest of the protection of heaven , We lovingly impart the apostolic_benediction . Peter s , in Rome , on the solemnity of Easter , the twenty first day of April , , in the first year_of_our_pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .
