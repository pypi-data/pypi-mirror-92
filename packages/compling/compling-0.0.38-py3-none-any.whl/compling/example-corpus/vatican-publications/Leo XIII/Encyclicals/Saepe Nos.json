From this supreme dignity of the Apostolic office , We have frequently directed Our solicitude and Our thoughts to your Catholic people ; and Our feelings have_been more_than_once recorded in published documents , from which all may clearly learn what_are Our dispositions towards Ireland . They are sufficiently attested by the provisions which , under Our direction , the Sacred Congregation of Propaganda made in former years respecting Ireland , and also by the letters which on more_than one occasion We addressed to Our Venerable Brother , Cardinal M Cabe , Archbishop of Dublin . Once again , they_have_been attested by the address which We recently delivered to a not inconsiderable number of Catholics belonging to your nation , from whom we received , not_only congratulations and heartfelt wishes for Our preservation , but_also expressions of gratitude on account of Our benevolent dispositions , clearly discerned by them , towards_the Irish people . Furthermore , within these past few months , when it was resolved to build a church in this city in honour of St . Patrick , the great Apostle of the Irish , We most warmly encouraged the undertaking , and We shall substantially aid it within_the limits of Our resources . Now this , Our paternal affection , remaining , as it does , unaltered , We cannot disguise that tidings which_have recently come to Us from Ireland have deeply pained and grieved Us . We have learned that an untoward excitement has suddenly arisen because the Sacred Congregation , whose office it -isaia- to vindicate the authority of the Church against those_who resist it , has decreed that_those methods of warfare known as Boycotting and the Plan of Campaign , which_had begun to be employed by many , may_not lawfully be used . And what_-isaia- more to be deplored , there_are not_a_few who_have come forward and summoned the people to excited meetings , where inconsiderate and dangerous opinions are set in circulation , the authority of the Decree not being spared . For not_only -isaia- the real scope of this Decree grievously perverted by means of forced interpretations , but , furthermore , it -isaia- even denied that obedience -isaia- due to the Decree , as if it were_not the true and proper office of the Church to decide what_-isaia- right and what_-isaia- wrong in human actions . Such a manner of acting -isaia- but little in harmony_with_the profession of the Christian religion , which assuredly brings in its train the virtues of moderation , respect , and obedience to legitimate authority . Besides , in a good cause , it -isaia- not fitting to seem in some sense to imitate those_who in the pursuit of an unlawful end seek to attain it by disorderly effort . Such line of action , too , -isaia- the more painful to Us inasmuch as We had carefully inquired into the case , so that We might obtain full and reliable knowledge of the state of your affairs , and of the causes of popular discontent . Our sources of information are trustworthy ; we investigated the matter in personal interview with yourselves ; further , last year we sent to you as legate a man of tried prudence and discretion , with the commission to use the greatest diligence in ascertaining the truth , and to make a faithful report to Us . For this_very act of watchful care the thanks of the Irish people_have been publicly given to Us . Can it therefore be asserted without rashness that We have_given judgment in a case with_which We were_not sufficiently acquainted the more so as We have condemned things_which fair minded men , not mixed up in your struggle , and thus bringing a calmer judgment to the consideration of the case , unite in condemning ? . There -isaia-_also a suspicion not less unjust to Us , namely_,_that the cause of Ireland appeals but feebly to Us , and that the present condition of her people gives Us little care . Now , on the contrary , We yield to no one in the intensity of Our feeling for the condition of the Irish people , and We have no more earnest desire than to see them -atti_degli_apostoli- length in the enjoyment of that peace and prosperity which_they_have so well deserved . We have_never opposed their struggling for a better state of things , but can it be regarded as admissible that in the carrying on of that struggle a way should be thrown open which might lead to evil deeds ? Rather , indeed , for the very reason_that , under the influence of passion and political partisanship , things lawful and unlawful are to be found mingled in the same cause , it has_been Our constant effort to mark off what_was right from what_was wrong , and to withhold Catholics from everything not sanctioned by the Christian rules of morals . On this account We gave to the Irish people timely counsels , to be mindful of their obligations as Catholics , and to take_part in nothing -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with natural right or forbidden by the Divine law . Hence the recent Decree ought not to have come upon them unexpectedly ; all the more as you yourselves , Venerable Brethren , assembled in Dublin in the year bade the clergy_and_people to beware of everything contrary to public order or to charity such as refusing to discharge just obligations ; preventing others from discharging theirs ; inflicting injury on anyone either in person or property ; violently resisting the law or those engaged in the discharge of public duties ; joining in secret societies and the like . These injunctions , most just in themselves and given most seasonably , were praised and approved by Us . Nevertheless , as the people were being carried away by ever_increasing vehemence in the pursuit of the object of their desires , and as there_were not wanting those_who daily fanned the flame , We perceived that something more definite was needed than the general precepts of justice and charity_which We had previously given . Our duty forbade us to suffer that so many Catholics , whose salvation must be Our first care , should pursue a hazardous and unsafe course leading rather to disorder than to the relief of distress . Let matters , then , be viewed in their true light , and let Ireland read in this Decree Our love for herself and Our desire to promote the prosperity she hopes for ; since nothing_-isaia- so harmful to a cause , however just , as recourse to violence and injustice in its defence . These instructions which We address to you , Venerable Brethren , you will convey to the Irish people . We feel confident that , united in due conformity of views and of purpose , and sustained not_only by your_own , but_also by Our authority , you will accomplish much and chiefly this , that the true estimate of things shall_not continue to be obscured by passion , and most especially that_those_who have urged on the people to excitement may come to regret the rashness with which_they_have acted . Since there_are_many who seem to seek out means of escaping from even the plainest obligations , take all necessary steps that no room be left for doubt as to the force of this Decree . Let it be understood by all that the entire method of action , whose employment We have forbidden , -isaia- forbidden as altogether unlawful . Let your_people seek to advance their lawful interests by lawful means , and most especially , as -isaia- becoming in Christians , without prejudice to justice or to obedience to the Apostolic See , virtues in which Ireland has in all times found comfort and strength . In the meantime , Venerable Brethren , as a pledge of heavenly favours , and in testimony of Our affection , We most lovingly in the Lord bestow on you , and on the clergy_and_people of Ireland , the Apostolic Benediction . Peter s , Rome , the th day of June , in the year , the eleventh year of Our Pontificate .
