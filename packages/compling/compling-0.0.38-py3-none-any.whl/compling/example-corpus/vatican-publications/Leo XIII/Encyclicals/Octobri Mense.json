Venerable Brethren , Greeting and Apostolic Benediction . At the coming of the month of October , dedicated and consecrated as it -isaia- to the Blessed Virgin of the Rosary , we recall with satisfaction the instant exhortations which in preceding years We addressed to you_,_venerable_brethren , desiring , as We did , that_the_faithful , urged by your authority and by your zeal , should redouble their piety towards_the august Mother of God , the mighty helper of Christians , and should pray to her throughout_the month , invoking her by that most_holy rite of the Rosary which_the Church , especially in the passage of difficult times , has_ever used for the accomplishment of all desires . This year once_again do We publish Our wishes , once_again do We encourage you by the same exhortations . We are persuaded to this in love for the Church , whose sufferings , far from mitigating , increase daily in number and in gravity . Universal and well_known are the evils we deplore : war made upon the sacred dogmas which_the Church holds and transmits ; derision cast upon the integrity of that Christian morality which_she has in keeping ; enmity declared , with the impudence of audacity and with criminal malice , against the very Christ , as though the Divine work of Redemption itself were to be destroyed from its foundation that work_which , indeed , no adverse power shall ever utterly abolish or destroy . No new events are these in the career of the Church militant . Jesus foretold them to His disciples . That she may teach men the truth and may guide them to eternal_salvation , she must enter upon a daily war ; and throughout_the course of ages she_has fought , even to martyrdom , rejoicing and glorifying herself in nothing_more than in the occasion of signing her cause with_her Founder s blood , the sure and certain pledge of the victory whereof she holds the promise . Nevertheless we must_not conceal the profound sadness with which_this necessity of constant war afflicts the righteous . It -isaia- indeed a cause of great sorrow that so many should be deterred and led astray by error and enmity to God ; that so many should be indifferent to all forms of religion , and should finally become estranged from faith ; that so many Catholics should be such in name only , and should pay to religion no honour or worship . And still sadder and more beset with anxieties grows the soul -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought of the fruitful source of most manifold evils existing in the organisation of States that allow no place to the Church , and that oppose her championship of holy virtue . This -isaia- truly a terrible manifestation of the just vengeance of God , Who allows blindness of soul to darken upon the nations that forsake Him . These are evils that cry aloud , that cry of themselves_with a daily increasing voice . It -isaia- absolutely necessary_that the Catholic voice should_also call to God with unwearied instance , '' without ceasing ; '' that the Faithful should pray not_only in their_own homes , but in public , gathered together under the sacred roof ; that_they_should beseech urgently the all foreseeing God to deliver the Church from evil men and to bring back the troubled nations to good sense and reason , by the light and love of Christ . Wonderful and beyond hope or belief -isaia- this . The world goes on its laborious way , proud of its riches , of its power , of its arms , of its genius ; the Church goes onward along the course of ages with an even step , trusting in God only , to Whom , day and night , she lifts her eyes and her suppliant hands . Even though in her prudence she neglects not the human aid which Providence and the times afford her , not in these does she put her trust , which rests in prayer , in supplication , in the invocation of God . Thus it -isaia- that_she renews her vital breath ; the diligence of her prayer has caused her , in her aloofness from worldly things and in her continual union with the Divine will , to live the tranquil and peaceful life of Our very Lord Jesus Christ ; being herself the image of Christ , Whose happy and perpetual joy was hardly marred by the horror of the torments He endured for us . This important doctrine of Christian wisdom has_been ever believed and practised by Christians worthy of the name . Their prayers rise to God eagerly and more frequently when_the cunning and the violence of the perverse afflict the Church and her supreme Pastor . Of this_the faithful of the Church in the East gave an example that should be offered to the imitation of posterity . Peter , Vicar of Jesus Christ , and first Pontiff of the Church , had_been cast into prison , loaded with chains by the guilty Herod , and left for certain death . None could carry him help or snatch him from the peril . But there_was the certain help that fervent prayer wins from God . The Church , as the sacred story tells us , made prayer without ceasing to God for him ; and the greater was_the fear of a misfortune , the greater was_the fervour of all who prayed to God . After the granting of their desires the miracle stood revealed ; and Christians still celebrate with a joyous gratitude the marvel of the deliverance of Peter . Christ has_given us a still_more memorable instance , a Divine instance , so that the Church might be formed not upon his precepts only , but upon His example also . During His whole_life He had given Himself to frequent and fervent prayer , and in the supreme hours in the Garden of Gethsemane , when His soul was filled_with bitterness and sorrow unto death , He prayed to His Father and prayed repeatedly . It was not_for Himself that He prayed thus , for He feared nothing and needed nothing , being God ; He prayed for us , for His Church , whose prayers and future tears He already then accepted with_joy , to give_them back in mercies . But since_the salvation of our race was accomplished by the mystery of the Cross , and since_the Church , dispenser of that salvation after_the triumph of Christ , was founded upon earth and instituted , Providence established a new order for a new people . The consideration of the Divine counsels -isaia- united to the great sentiment of religion . The Eternal Son of God , about to take upon Him our nature for the saving and ennobling of man , and about to consummate thus a mystical union between Himself and all mankind , did_not accomplish His design without adding there the free consent of the elect Mother , who represented in some sort all human kind , according to the illustrious and just opinion of St . Thomas , who says_that the Annunciation was effected with the consent of the Virgin standing in the place of humanity . With equal truth may it be also affirmed that , by the will of God , Mary -isaia- the intermediary through whom -isaia- distributed unto us this immense treasure of mercies gathered by God , for mercy and truth were created by Jesus Christ . Thus as no man goeth to the Father but by the Son , so no man goeth to Christ but by His Mother . How great are the goodness and mercy revealed in this design of God ! What a correspondence with the frailty of man ! We believe in the infinite goodness of the Most High , and we rejoice in it ; we believe also in His justice and we fear it . We adore the beloved Saviour , lavish of His blood and of His life ; we dread the inexorable Judge . Thus do those_whose actions have disturbed their consciences need an intercessor mighty in favour with God , merciful enough not to reject the cause of the desperate , merciful enough to lift up again towards hope in the divine mercy the afflicted and the broken down . Mary -isaia- this glorious intermediary ; she_-isaia- the mighty Mother of the Almighty ; but what_-isaia- still sweeter she_-isaia- gentle , extreme in tenderness , of a limitless loving kindness . As such God gave her to us . Having chosen her for the Mother of His only_begotten Son , He taught her all a mother s feeling that breathes nothing but pardon and love . Such Christ desired she should be , for He consented to be subject to Mary and to obey her as a son a mother . Such He proclaimed her from the cross when he entrusted to her care and love the whole of the race of man in the person of His disciple John . Such , finally , she proves herself by her courage in gathering in the heritage of the enormous labours of her Son , and in accepting the charge of her_maternal duties towards us all . The design of this_most dear mercy , realised by God in Mary and confirmed by the testament of Christ , was comprehended -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning , and accepted with the utmost joy by the Holy Apostles and the earliest believers . It was_the counsel and teaching of the venerable Fathers of the Church . All the nations of the Christian age received it with one mind ; and even_when literature and tradition are silent there_-isaia- a voice that breaks from every Christian breast and speaks with all eloquence . No other reason -isaia- needed that that of a Divine faith_which , by a powerful and most pleasant impulse , persuades us towards Mary . Nothing -isaia- more natural , nothing_more desirable than to seek a refuge in the protection and in the loyalty of her to whom we may confess our designs and our actions , our innocence and our repentance , our torments and our joys , our prayers and our desires all our of fairs . All men , moreover , are filled_with_the hope and confidence that petitions which might be received with less favour from the lips of unworthy men , God will accept when_they_are recommended by the most Holy Mother , and will grant with all favours . The truth and the sweetness of these thoughts bring to the soul an unspeakable comfort ; but_they inspire all the more compassion for those_who , being without Divine faith , honour not Mary and have her not_for their mother ; for those also who , holding Christian faith , dare to accuse of excess the devotion to Mary , thereby sorely wounding filial piety . This storm of evils , in the midst of which_the Church struggles so strenuously , reveals to all her pious children the holy duty whereto they are_bound to pray to God with instance , and the manner in which_they may give to their prayers the greater power . Faithful to the religious example of our fathers , let us have_recourse to Mary , our holy Sovereign . Let us entreat , let us beseech , with one heart , Mary , the Mother of Jesus Christ , our Mother . '' Show thyself to be a mother ; cause our prayers to be accepted by Him Who , born for us , consented to be thy Son . Now , among the several rites and manners of paying honour to the Blessed Mary , some are to be preferred , inasmuch as we know them to be most powerful and most pleasing to our Mother ; and for this_reason we specially mention by name and recommend the Rosary . The common language has_given the name of corona to this manner of prayer , which recalls to our minds the great mysteries of Jesus and Mary united in joys , sorrows , and triumphs . The contemplation of these august mysteries , contemplated in their order , of fords to faithful souls a wonderful confirmation of faith , protection against the disease of error , and increase of the strength of the soul . The soul and memory of him_who thus prays , enlightened by faith , are drawn towards these mysteries by the sweetest devotion , are absorbed therein and are surprised before the work of the Redemption of mankind , achieved -atti_degli_apostoli- such a price and by events so great . The soul -isaia- filled_with gratitude and love before these proofs of Divine love ; its hope becomes enlarged and its desire -isaia- increased for those things_which Christ has prepared_for such as have united themselves to Him in imitation of His example and in participation in His sufferings . The prayer_-isaia- composed of words proceeding from God Himself , from the Archangel Gabriel , and from the Church ; full of praise and of high desires ; and it -isaia- renewed and continued in an order -atti_degli_apostoli- once fixed and various ; its fruits are ever_new and sweet . Moreover , we may well believe_that the Queen of Heaven herself has granted an especial efficacy to this mode of supplication , for it was by her command and counsel that the devotion was begun and spread abroad by the holy Patriarch Dominic as a most potent weapon against the enemies of the faith -atti_degli_apostoli- an epoch not , indeed , unlike our_own , of great danger to our holy religion . The heresy of the Albigenses had in effect , one while covertly , another while openly , overrun many countries , and this_most vile off spring of the Manicheans , whose deadly errors it reproduced , were_the cause in stirring up against the Church the most bitter animosity and a virulent persecution . There seemed to be no human hope of opposing this fanatical and most pernicious sect when timely succour came from on high through the instrument of Mary s Rosary . Thus under the favour of the powerful Virgin , the glorious vanquisher of all heresies , the forces of the wicked were destroyed and dispersed , and faith issued forth unharmed and more shining than before . All manner of similar instances are widely recorded , and both ancient and modern history furnish remarkable proofs of nations saved from perils and winning benedictions therefrom . There -isaia- another signal argument in favour of this_devotion , inasmuch as from the very moment of its institution it was immediately encouraged and put into most frequent practice by all classes of society . In truth , the piety of the Christian people honours , by many titles and in multiform ways , the Divine Mother , who , alone most admirable among all creatures , shines resplendent in unspeakable glory . But this title of the Rosary , this mode of prayer which seems to contain , as it were , a final pledge of affection , and to sum up in itself the honour due to Our Lady , has_always_been highly cherished and widely used in private and in public , in homes and in families , in the meetings of confraternities , -atti_degli_apostoli- the dedication of shrines , and in solemn processions ; for there_has seemed to be no better means of conducting sacred solemnities , or of obtaining protection and favours . Nor may we permit to pass unnoticed the especial Providence of God displayed in this_devotion ; for through the lapse of time religious fervour has sometimes seemed to diminish in certain nations , and even this pious method of prayer has fallen into disuse ; but piety and devotion have again flourished and become vigorous in a most marvellous manner , when , either through the grave situation of the commonwealth or through some pressing public necessity , general recourse has_been had more to this than to even other means of obtaining help to the Rosary , whereby it has_been restored to its place of honour on the altars . But there_-isaia- no need to seek for examples of this_power in a past age , since we have in the present a signal instance of it . In these times so troublous as we have_said before for the Church , and so heartrending for ourselves set as We are by the Divine will -atti_degli_apostoli- the helm , it -isaia- still given Us to note with admiration the great zeal and fervour with_which Mary s Rosary -isaia- honoured and recited in every place and nation of the Catholic world . And this circumstance , which assuredly -isaia- to be attributed to the Divine action and direction upon men , rather_than to the wisdom and efforts of individuals , strengthens and consoles Our heart , filling Us with_great hope_for the ultimate and most glorious triumph of the Church under the auspices of Mary . But there_are_some who , whilst they honestly agree with what We have_said , yet because their hopes especially as regard the peace and tranquillity of the Church have_not yet been fulfilled , nay , rather because troubles seem to augment , have ceased to pray with diligence and fervour , in a fit of discouragement . Let these look into themselves and labour that the prayers they address to God may be made in a proper spirit , according to the precept of our Lord Jesus Christ . And if there be such , let_them reflect how unworthy and how wrong it -isaia- to wish to assign to Almighty God the time and the manner of giving His assistance , since He owes nothing to us , and when He hearkens to our supplications and crowns our merits , He only crowns His own innumerable benefits ; and when He complies least with_our wishes it -isaia- as a good father towards his_children , having pity on their childishness and consulting their advantage . But as regards the prayers which we join to the suffrages of the heavenly citizens , and offer humbly to God to obtain His mercy for the Church , they_are always favourably received and heard , and either obtain for the Church great and imperishable benefits , or their influence -isaia- temporarily withheld for a time of greater need . In truth , to these supplications -isaia- added an immense weight and grace the prayers and merits of Christ Our Lord , Who has loved the Church and has delivered Himself up for_her to sanctify her . so that He should be glorified in her . He -isaia- her Sovereign Head , holy , innocent , always living to make intercession for us , on whose prayers and supplication we can always by divine authority rely . As for_what concerns the exterior and temporal prosperity of the Church , it -isaia- evident_that she_has to cope with most malicious and powerful adversaries . Too often has she suffered -atti_degli_apostoli- their hands the abolition of her rights , the diminution and oppression of her liberties , scorn and affronts to her authority , and every conceivable outrage . And if in their wickedness her enemies have_not accomplished all the injury they_had resolved upon and striven to do , they nevertheless seem to go on unchecked . But , despite them the Church , amidst all these conflicts , will_always stand out and increase in greatness and glory . Nor can human_reason rightly understand why evil , apparently so dominant , should yet be so restricted as regards its results ; whilst the Church , driven into straits , comes forth glorious and triumphant . And she ever remains more steadfast in virtue because_she draws men to the acquisition of the ultimate good . And since this_-isaia- her_mission , her prayers must_have much power to effect the end and purpose of God s providential and merciful designs towards men . Thus , when men pray with and through the Church , they -atti_degli_apostoli- length obtain what Almighty God has designed from all eternity to bestow upon mankind . The subtlety of the human intelligence fails now to grasp the high designs of Providence ; but the time will come when , through the goodness of God , causes and effects will be made clear , and the marvellous power and utility of prayer will be shown forth . Then it will be seen how_many in the midst of a corrupt age have kept themselves pure and inviolate from all concupiscence of the flesh and the spirit , working out_their sanctification in the fear of God ; how others , when exposed to the danger of temptation , have without delay restrained themselves gaining new strength for virtue from the peril itself ; how others , having fallen , have_been seized with the ardent desire to be restored to the embraces of a compassionate God . Therefore , with_these reflections before them , We beseech all again_and_again not to yield to the deceits of the old enemy , nor for_any cause whatsoever to cease from the duty of prayer . Let their prayers be persevering , let_them pray without intermission ; let their first care be to supplicate for the sovereign good the eternal_salvation of the whole_world , and the safety of the Church . Then they_may ask from God other benefits for the use and comfort of life , returning thanks always , whether their desires are granted or refused , as to a most indulgent father . Finally , may_they converse with God with the greatest piety and devotion according to the example of the Saints , and that of our Most Holy Master and Redeemer , with_great cries and tears . Our fatherly solicitude urges Us to implore of God , the Giver of all good gifts , not merely the spirit of prayer , but also_that of holy penance for all the sons of the Church . And whilst We make_this most earnest supplication , We exhort all and each_one to the practice with equal fervour of both these virtues combined . Thus prayer fortifies the soul , makes it strong for noble endeavours , leads it up to divine things : penance enables us to overcome ourselves , especially our bodies most inveterate enemies of reason and the evangelical law . And it -isaia-_very clear_that these virtues unite well with each_other , assist each_other mutually , and have_the same object , namely , to detach man born for heaven from perishable objects , and to raise him up to heavenly commerce with God . On the other_hand , the mind that_-isaia- excited by passions and enervated by pleasure -isaia- insensible to the delights of heavenly things , and makes cold and neglectful prayers quite unworthy of being accepted by God . We have before Our eyes examples of the penance of holy men whose prayers and supplications were consequently most pleasing to God , and even obtained miracles . They governed and kept assiduously in subjection their_minds and hearts and wills . They accepted with the greatest joy and humility the doctrines of Christ and the teachings of His Church . Their unique desire was to advance in the science of God ; nor had their actions any_other object than the increase of His glory . They restrained most severely their passions , treated their bodies rudely and harshly , abstaining from even permitted pleasures through love of virtue . And therefore most deservedly could they have_said with the Apostle Paul , our conversation -isaia- in Heaven : hence_the potent efficacy of their prayers in appeasing and in supplicating the Divine Majesty . It -isaia- clear_that not every one_-isaia- obliged or able to attain to these heights ; nevertheless , each one_should correct his_life and morals in his_own measure in satisfaction to the Divine justice : for it -isaia- to those_who_have endured voluntary sufferings in this life_that the reward of virtue -isaia- vouchsafed . Moreover , when in the mystical_body of Christ , which_-isaia- the Church , all the members are_united and flourish , it results , according to St . Paul , that the joy or pain of one member -isaia- shared by all the rest , so that if one of the brethren in Christ -isaia- suffering in mind or body the others come to his help and succour him as far as in them lies . The members are solicitous in regard of each_other , and if one member suffer all the members suffer in sympathy , and if one member rejoice all the others rejoice also . But you_are the body of Christ , members of one_body . But in this illustration of charity , following_the_example of Christ , Who in the immensity of His love gave up His life to redeem us from sin , paying Himself the penalties incurred by others , in this_-isaia- the great bond of perfection by which_the faithful_are closely united with the heavenly citizens and with God . Above all , acts of holy penance are so numerous and varied and extend over such a wide range , that_each one may exercise them frequently with a cheerful and ready will without serious or painful effort . And now , venerable_brethren , your remarkable and exalted piety towards theMost Holy Mother of God , and your charity and solicitude for the Christianflock , are full of abundant promise : Our heart_-isaia- full of desire_for thosewondrous fruits which , on many occasions , the devotion of Catholic people toMary has brought forth ; already We enjoy them deeply and abundantly inanticipation . At your exhortation and under your direction , therefore , thefaithful , especially during_this ensuing month , will assemble around_the solemnaltars of this august Queen and most benign Mother , and weave and offer to her , like devoted children , the mystic garland so pleasing to her of the Rosary . Allthe privileges and indulgences We have herein before conceded are confirmed andratified . How grateful and magnificent a spectacle to see in the cities , and towns , and villages , on land and sea wherever the Catholic faith_has penetrated manyhundreds of thousands of pious people uniting their praises and prayers with onevoice and heart -atti_degli_apostoli- every moment of the day , saluting Mary , invoking Mary , hopingeverything through Mary . Through her may all the faithful strive to obtain fromher Divine Son that the nations plunged in error may return to the Christianteaching and precepts , in which_-isaia- the foundation of the public safety and thesource Of peace and true happiness . Through her maythey steadfastly endeavour for that_most desirable of all blessings , therestoration of the liberty of our Mother , the Church , and the tranquilpossession of her rights rights which_have no other object than the carefuldirection of men s dearest interests , from the exercise of which individuals andnations have_never suffered injury , but have derived , in all time , numerous andmost precious benefits . And for you_,_venerable_brethren , through the intercession of the Queen ofthe Most Holy Rosary , We pray Almighty God to grant you heavenly_gifts , andgreater and more abundant strength , and aid to accomplish the charge of yourpastoral office . As a pledge of which We most lovingly bestow upon you and uponthe clergy_and_people committed to your_care , the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , St .
