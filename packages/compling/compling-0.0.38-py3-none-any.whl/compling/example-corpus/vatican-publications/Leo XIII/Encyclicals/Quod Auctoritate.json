Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . That which We , by the Apostolic authority , have more_than_once decreed , that an extraordinary year of Jubilee should be kept throughout_the whole Christian world , and the treasures of heavenly_gifts , the dispensation of which_-isaia- in Our power , should be thrown open to the faithful that_with the favour of God We have determined to decree for the ensuing year . The advantages of this step will_not escape you , Venerable Brethren , who_are so familiar with the spirit of the age and the temper of the time , but there_-isaia- a special reason now which_makes Our decision seem more_than usually opportune . In view of the fact_that in Our recent Encyclical Letter We pointed_out how important it -isaia- that the States should conform as closely as possible to truth and the Christian ideal , it will easily be understood how fitting it -isaia- that We should now use every_effort to excite men , or to lead_them back to the practice of Christian virtues . For a State -isaia- what_the lives of the people make it : and just as the excellence of a ship or a house -isaia- dependent upon the good quality and the right adjustment of its component parts , so , unless the individual citizens lead good lives , the State cannot keep in the path of virtue , and without offending . Civil government and those things_which constitute the public_life of a country come into existence and perish by the act of men ; and men almost always succeed in stamping the image of their opinions and their_lives upon their public institutions . In order therefore that Our teaching may sink into men s minds , and what_-isaia- the great thing , actually govern their_daily lives , an attempt must be made to bring them to think and act like Christians , not less in public than in private . And in this_matter effort -isaia- the more needful because perils everywhere abound . The great virtues of our forefathers have in large measure disappeared ; the most violent passions have claimed a freer indulgence ; the madness of opinion which knows no restraint , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least no effective restraint , every_day extends further ; of those_whose principles are sound there_are_many who , through a misplaced timidity , are frightened , and have_not the courage even to speak out_their opinions boldly , far less to translate them_into deeds ; everywhere the worst examples are affecting public morals ; wicked societies which We ourselves have denounced before now , skilled in all evil arts , are doing their best to lead the people astray , and as far as they are_able , to withdraw them_from God , their_duty , and Christianity . Amid these many and pressing evils , which_are the more_serious because_they_are already of long duration , nothing must be left undone by Us which_can afford any hope of relief . With this_purpose , and in this hope , We proclaim a sacred Jubilee to all those_who_have their salvation -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , and need to be reminded and exhorted to raise their thoughts , now busied with worldly matters , to the contemplation of heavenly things . And this with a gain not merely to the individuals themselves , but to the whole future well_being of the commonwealth , because in proportion as individual citizens advance along the path of perfection , there_-isaia- a corresponding increase in the general rectitude and probity , in the public_life and morals of the nation . But you will observe , Venerable Brethren , that success will largely depend upon your industry and zeal , as it will be needful to prepare the people properly and carefully if they_are to reap the fruits which_are to be placed before them . We commit it to your judgment and prudence to place this_matter in the hands of priests whom_you may select , that by discourses fitted to the capacity of the crowd they_may instruct them , and above all exhort them to that penance which , according to St . Augustine , consists in '' the daily chastisement of the good and the faithful followers of Christ in which we strike our breasts , saying forgive us our sins . '' With good_reason We mention here in the first_place that part of penance which consists of the voluntary punishment of the body . You know_the temper of the times how_many there_are who love to live delicately and shrink from whatever requires manhood and generosity ; who , when aliments come , discover in them sufficient reasons for no to beying the salutary laws of the Church , thinking the burden laid upon them more_than they_can bear , when_they_are told to abstain from certain kinds of food orto fast during a few days in the year . It -isaia- not to be wondered -atti_degli_apostoli- if , weakened by these habits of indulgence , they gradually give themselves up body_and_soul to the more imperious passions . It -isaia- therefore necessary to recall to the paths of moderation those_who_have fallen or who_are likely to fall through_this sort of effeminacy . Therefore those_who speak to the people should lay it down persistently and clearly that according not_only to the law of the Gospel , but_even to the dictates of natural reason , a man_-isaia- bound to govern himself and keep his passions under strict control , and moreover , that sin cannot be expiated except by penance . That the virtue of which We have spoken may be durable , it will be prudent to put it in some sort under the safe guardand protection of a stable institution ; you_know well , venerable_brothers , towhat We allude ; We mean_that you_should continue each_one in his_own diocese to protect and propagate the Third Order , called the Secular Order , of the Franciscan Friars . To keep up the spirit of penance in the Christian multitude nothing_-isaia- more effectual than the example and the grace of the Patriarch Francis of Assisi , who combined with the greatest innocence of life so much zeal for mortification that the image of Jesus Christ crucified was_not less visible in his_life and conduct than in the signs which_were supernaturally impressed upon him . The laws of his Order , which We have modified for the times , are as light to bear as they_are effectual for the practice of Christian virtue . In the second place , as every hope of safety lies in the protection and succour of our Heavenly Father in the midst of so great private and public necessities , We would earnestly desire to see confidence united with the revival of an assiduous zeal in prayer . In every great crisis of Christendom , and every time the Church was afflicted by evils within or dangers without , our fore fathers , with their_eyes lifted to Heaven in supplication , taught us how and when we should seek for the light of our souls , for the strength of virtue , andfor help suited to the need . For deeply engraved upon men s minds were these precepts of Jesus Christ : '' Ask and it shall be given you ; '' '' We ought always to pray and not to faint . '' And with this_teaching the word of the Apostle corresponds : '' Pray without ceasing ; '' '' I desire , therefore , first of all that supplications , prayers , intercessions , and thanksgivings be made for all men . '' Upon which subject St . John Chrysostom has left us this saying , not less true than ingenious , in the form of a comparison : '' Even as man_,_who comes into the light of day naked and wanting all things , has_been end owed by nature with hands to procure for_himself all the necessaries of life ; so in supernatural things , seeing that of himself he can do nothing , he has received_from God the faculty of prayer , that_he_may use it wisely for the obtaining of all that_-isaia- needful to his salvation . From all this , Venerable Brethren , each_one of you_may gather how agreeable to Us and how commendable -isaia- the zeal with_which -atti_degli_apostoli- Our suggestion you_have spread the devotion to the Most Holy Rosary , especially in these last years . Nor can We pass over the popular_piety which_has almost everywhere been excited by this method of prayer . Now you_must watch with the greatest care that this_devotion be practiced with even greater and greater fervour , and that it be persevered in without failing . And if We insist upon this_exhortation , as We have_already done several times , not one of you will be surprised , for you understand how important it -isaia- that_this habit of the Rosary of Mary should flourish among Christians . And you_are perfectly aware that_this_-isaia- a part and a beautiful form of that spirit of prayer of which we speak , and that_it_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once admirably suited to our_times , easy to practice , and fruitful in results . But as the first and the chief fruit of the Jubilee must be , as We have_already pointed_out , amendment of life and progress in virtue , We deem especially necessary the avoidance of that evil which We have_not neglected to point_out in Our past Encyclicals . We allude to those internal , and , as it were , domestic dissensions among some of ourselves ; dissensions of which_it_-isaia- hardly possible to say how_much they break or relax the bonds of charity , to the great detriment of souls . If We recall this to you once_more , Venerable Brethren , who_are the guardians of ecclesiastical discipline and of mutual charity , it -isaia- that We desire to see your watchfulness and your authority always directed to the prevention of so great an evil . By your warnings , your exhortations , your reproaches , urge all '' to keep the unity of spirit in the bond of peace , '' induce the authors of the dissensions , if such there be , to return to their_duty by the consideration which they_should ever keep in mind_that the only_begotten Son of God , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the approach of His last torments , asked nothing_more urgently of His Father than the mutual love of those_who believed , or should believe , in Him , '' that_they_may all be one , even as Thou , Father , art in Me , and I in Thee , that_they also may be one in Us . Relying , therefore , on the mercy of the omnipotent God , and the authority of the Blessed Apostles St . Paul , and making use of that power of binding and loosing which_our Lord has_given to Us , though unworthy of it , We grant under the form of a General Jubilee a plenary indulgence to all the faithful of both sexes upon this condition and subject to this obligation , that during the coming year of they perform the things mentioned below . The citizens and inhabitants of Rome must pay two visits to the Lateran , the Vatican , and the Liberian Basilicas , and pray there for some time to God according to Our intentions for the well_being and the exaltation of the Church , for the rooting out of all heresy , and for the conversion of all who_are in error , and in accordance_with Our intentions pour out prayers to God that concord may reign among Christian princes , and that peace and unity may be the lot of all the faithful . They must_also fast for two days , only using the food usually allowed in times of penance , in addition to the forty days of Lent and other days set_aside by the Church as fast days . They must_also , after_having properly confessed their sins , receive Holy Communion , and , in accordance_with_the advice of their confessor , give an alms , each according_to_his means , to the furthering of some work likely to promote the propagation and increase of the Catholic Church . Each may choose the object he prefers ; but We think it well especially to name two , towards which assistance may be given with the greatest advantage ; and of these each -isaia- an object which in many places -isaia- in need of help and aid , and fruitful in advantage , not less for the State than for the Church , We mean the Primary schools for boys and the Seminaries for the Clergy . Those who reside outside Rome , in whatever part_of_the_world they_may live , must pay two visits -atti_degli_apostoli- prescribed intervals to three churches to be appointed by you , Venerable Brethren , your Vicars or Officials , on your or their command , by those_who_have the charge of souls ; or three visits if there_are only two churches , or six visits if there_-isaia- only_one ; and also must comply with all the conditions already laid_down above . This indulgence may be applied by way of suffrage to the souls who_have departed this_life joined in charity with God . We give_you power to reduce the number of the visits according to your judgment to certain churches in the case of chapters , congregations , as well secular as regular , communities , confraternities , universities , and colleges where_the visits are made in procession . Sailors and travellers may obtain the indulgence upon their return home , ortheir arrival -atti_degli_apostoli- some fixed station , by visiting six times the principal church , or the parish church of the district , and complying with the other conditions which We have_already laid_down . In the case of regulars of either sex , and evenin the case of persons belonging to enclosed orders , and also in the case of all others , whether ecclesiastical or lay , who_are prevented either because_they arein prison , or through infirmity , or any_other good_reason , from fulfilling the above conditions , or some of them , the confessor has power to commute for other pious works , and also_has power to dispense from Communion children who have_not yet made their First Communion . Moreover , We grant to all and each of the faithful , both lay and ecclesiastic , secular and regular , of whatever order and institute , and even of those_which ought to be specially named , that_they_should choose for the purpose of the Jubilee any approved confessor they like ; nuns , novices , and other women living in the cloister may avail themselves of this_power provided the confessor chosen -isaia- approved for nuns . To confessors up on this occasion , and while the time of this Jubilee lasts , We grant all the faculties which_were granted by Our Letters Apostolic of February th , , beginning with the words Pontifices maximi ; always excepting the things_which were excepted in those Letters . Finally let all do their best to gain the graces of heaven during_this time by a special devotion to the great Mother of God . For We wish this Jubilee to be placed under the patronage of the Most Holy Rosary of the Virgin ; and with_her assistance We are confident that_there will be many whose souls , set free by the cleansing away of the stains of sin , will be renewed by faith and piety and justice , not_only to the hope of eternal_salvation , but_also as an earnest of amore peaceful time . As a pledge of heavenly graces and a witness to Our fatherly good_will towards you , We give from the bottom of Our heart_the Apostolic Benediction to you and your Clergy , and the whole_people committed to your_care and watchfulness . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the twenty second day of December , in the year , the eighth of Our Pontificate .
