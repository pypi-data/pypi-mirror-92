Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . We return thanks as -isaia- meet , to the sovereign goodness of God , Whose will and providential wish governs the whole of men s lives , that the fiftieth anniversary of Our priesthood has shown upon the Church . Moreover , the wonderful unanimity of hearts displayed in the tokens of respect , the liberal gifts , the public manifestations of readiness , -isaia- such as He alone could have inspired , on Whom entirely depends the spirits , the wills , and the hearts of men , and who rules and directs events for the glory of the Christian religion . It -isaia- indeed a wonderful and memorable event , whereby_the enemies of the Church , in spite of themselves , whether_they desire it or not , see with_their own eyes that the Church maintains her divine_life , and the virtue with_which she_-isaia- endowed from heaven ; this indeed makes them feel_that the impious strive in vain when_they rage and plan foolish attacks against the Lord and against His Christ . In order_that the memory of this heavenly benefit may be continued , and that_its utility may be spread as far and wide as possible , We have laid open the treasures of heavenly graces to all the flock committed to Our care . We have_not been wanting in imploring the succours of divine mercy in favour of those_who_are outside the ark of salvation whereby We hope to obtain that all nations and all peoples , united in the faith by the bond of charity may soon form one flock under one shepherd . This -isaia- what We have asked of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Our supplications on the occasion of the late solemn canonisations . For lifting up Our eyes towards_the Church triumphant We have solemnly decreed and accorded on the one_hand the supreme honour of the Saints ; on the other the title of Blessed , to those Christian heroes , the examination of whose sublime virtues and miracles have_been happily concluded according to due rights of law , so that the heavenly Jerusalem may be joined in a communion of the same joy with_those_who still pursue on earth the pilgrimage which_-isaia- to lead_them to God . But by the help of God , in order_that We may crown this joy , We desire to fulfil , as far as lays in Our power , Our apostolic duty of charity by extending the plenitude of Our infinite spiritual treasures to those beloved_children of the Church who , having died the death of the just , have quitted this_world of strife with the sign of faith , and are branches of the mystical vine , though they_cannot enter_into everlasting rest until they_have paid the uttermost farthing which_they owe to the avenging justice of God . We are moved to this both by the pious desires of Catholics to whom We knowthat Our resolution will be especially grateful , and by the fearful tortureswhich the souls of the departed suffer , but We are_also animated by the customof the Church , which , amidst the most joyous solemnities of the year , fails notto make a holy and salutary commemoration of the dead that_they_may be deliveredfrom their sins . Therefore , since_it_-isaia- certain by the doctrine of the Catholic Church , that the souls detained in purgatory are benefited by the prayers of the faithful , and especially by the august Sacrifice of the Altar , We think we can give_them no more useful and desirable pledge of Our love than by everywhere increasing the offering of the pure oblation of the Most Holy Sacrifice of Our Divine Mediator , for the extinction of their pain . We therefore decree , with all the necessary dispensations and indulgences , the last Sunday of next September as a day of ample expiation on which_will be celebrated by Ourselves , and equally by each of Our brethren the Patriarchs , Archbishops , and Bishops , and also by other prelates exercising jurisdiction in a diocese , each in his_own church , whether patriarchal , metropolitan , or cathedral , a special Mass for the Dead with the greatest solemnity possible , and according to the rite ordered in the Missal for the Commemoration of all Souls . We desire also_that this should_take placein the same manner in all parish and collegiate churches , both of the secular and regular clergy , and by all priests generally , provided_that they_do_not omit the proper office of the Mass for the day where it -isaia- obligatory . As to the faithful , We strenuously exhort them after Sacramental confessiondevoutly to partake of the Bread of Angels for the benefit of the souls inpurgatory . We grant by Our Apostolic authority a plenary indulgence to be gainedby such of the faithful , applicable to the dead , and the favour of a privilegedaltar to all those_who , as has been_said before , say Mass . Thus those pious souls who expiate the remainder of their sins amidst such tortures will receive a special and opportune consolation , thanks to the life_giving Victim which_the Universal Church united to her visible head , and animated with a like spirit of charity , will offer to God that He may admit them to the dwelling of His consolation , to light and eternal peace . In the meanwhile , Venerable Brethren , We affectionately grant you in theLord as a pledge of celestial gifts , the Apostolic Benediction , to you and toall the clergy_and_people committed to your charge .
