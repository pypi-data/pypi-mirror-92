FRANCIS OF ASSISI To all the Patriarchs , Primates , Archbishops , and Bishops of the Catholic World in the Grace and Communion of the Apostolic See . Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . A happy circumstance enables the Christian world to celebrate , -atti_degli_apostoli- a not far distant interval , the memory of two men_who , having been_called to receive in heaven the eternal reward of their holiness , have left on earth a crowd of disciples , the ever_increasing off spring from their virtues . For , after_the centenary solemnities in honour of St . Benedict , the father and law giver of the monks of the West , the opportunity of paying public honours to St . Francis of Assisi will likewise be furnished by the seventh centenary of his birth . It -isaia- not_without reason_that We see therein a merciful intention of Divine Providence . For , by calling on men to celebrate the birthdays of these illustrious Fathers , God would seem to wish that_they_should be induced to keep in mind their signal merits , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time to understand_that the Religious Orders they founded ought on no account to have_been the objects of such unbefitting acts of violence , least of all in those States where_the seeds of civilization and of fame were cast by their labour , their genius and their zeal . We are confident that_these solemn feasts will_not prove fruitless to the Christian world , which has_always , and rightly , deemed the Religious Orders its friends ; and thus , having honoured as it has with love and gratitude the name of St . Benedict , it will strive with equal ardour , by public festivities and by numerous acts of piety , to revive the memory of St . Nor -isaia- the field whereon this noble rivalry in devotion will be displayed bounded by the limits of the region where this_great saint first saw the light , nor by those of the neighbouring territories enlightened by his presence , but it extends to every_part of the earth , wherever the name of Francis has become known and his institutions flourish . Certainly We , of all others , approve of this zeal for so excellent an object , especially because We have_been accustomed from Our youth to admire Francis of Assisi and to pay him a particular veneration ; because We glory in being on the roll of the Franciscan family ; and because , more_than_once , We have , out of devotion , climbed with eagerness and joy the sacred heights of Alvernia ; there the image of that great man presented itself to Us wherever We trod , and that solitude teeming with memories held Our spirit rapt in silent contemplation . But , however praiseworthy this zeal may be , it -isaia-_not_enough ; it must be understood that the honours in preparation_for St . Francis will be especially pleasing to him_who_-isaia- honoured , if they_who pay them derive profit therefrom . Now their solid and lasting fruit -isaia- in the attaining some likeness to him whose eminent virtue -isaia- an object of admiration , and in endeavouring to improve by imitating him . If , with the help of God , this practice -isaia- zealously followed , an opportune and extremely efficacious remedy will have_been found for the evils of the present_time . And therefore it -isaia- that We wish , venerable_brethren , not_only that_these Letters should convey to you the public testimony of Our devotion to St . Francis , but that_they_should , moreover , excite your charity to labour with Us for the salvation of men by means of the remedy We have just pointed_out . Jesus Christ , the Liberator of mankind , -isaia- the everlasting and ever flowing source of all the good things_that come to us from the infinite bounty of God ; so that He who_has once saved the world_-isaia- he who_will save it throughout all ages ; '' for there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given to men whereby We must be saved . '' If then the human_race fall_into sin , either through its natural propensities or through the faults of men , it -isaia- absolutely indispensable to have_recourse to Jesus Christ and to recognize in Him the most powerful and the most sure means of salvation . For so great and so efficacious -isaia- its divine virtue that_it_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- once a refuge from all dangers and a remedy for all evils . And the cure -isaia- certain , if mankind returns to the profession of Christian doctrine and to the rules of life laid_down by the Gospel . When the evils We have spoken of arise , as soon as the providentially appointed hour of help has struck , God raises up a man , not one of the common herd , but eminent and unique , to whom he assigns the salvation of all . Such -isaia- what came to pass -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the twelfth century and in the few subsequent years ; St . Francis was_the agent in this_great work . That period -isaia- sufficiently well_known , and its character of mingled virtues and vices . The Catholic faith was deeply rooted in men s souls , and it was a glorious sight to see multitudes in flamed by piety set_forth for Palestine , resolved to conquer or to die . But licentiousness had greatly impaired popular morality , and nothing was more needed by men than a return to Christian sentiments . Now the perfection of Christian virtue lies in that disposition of soul which dares all that_-isaia- arduous or difficult ; its symbol -isaia- the Cross , which those_who would follow Jesus Christ must carry on their shoulder . The effects of this disposition are a heart detached from mortal things , complete self control , and a gentle and resigned endurance of adversity . In fine , the love of God and of one s neighbour -isaia- the mistress and sovereign of all other virtues : such_-isaia- its power that it wipes away all the hardships that accompany the fulfilment of duty , and renders the hardest labours not_only bearable , but agreeable . There was a dearth of such virtue in the twelfth century ; for too many among_men , enslaved by the things of this_world , either coveted madly honours and wealth , or lived a life of luxury and self gratification . All power was centred in a few , and had almost become an instrument of oppression to the wretched and despised masses ; and those even who ought by their profession to have_been an example to others , had not avoided defiling themselves_with the prevalent vices . The extinction of charity in divers places was followed by scourges manifold and daily ; envy , jealousy , hatred , were rife ; and minds were so divided and hostile that on the slightest pretext neighbouring cities waged war amongst themselves , and individuals armed themselves against one_another . In this century appeared St . Yet with wondrous resolution and simplicity he undertook to place before the eyes of the aging world , in his_words and deeds , the complete model of Christian perfection . And even as -atti_degli_apostoli- that period the blessed Father Dominic Guzman was occupied in defending the integrity of heavensent doctrine and in dissipating the perverse errors of heretics by the light of Christian wisdom , so was_the grace granted to St . Francis , whom God was guiding to the execution of great works , of inciting Christians to virtue , and of bringing back to the imitation of Christ those men_who had strayed both long and far . It was certainly no mere chance that brought to the ears of the youth these counsels of the gospel : '' Do not possess gold , nor silver , nor money in your purses ; nor scrip for your journey , nor two coats , nor shoes , nor a staff . '' And again , '' If thou wilt be perfect , go sell what thou hast , and give to the poor . and come , follow Me . '' Considering these_words as directed personally to himself , he -atti_degli_apostoli- once deprives himself of all , changes his clothing , adopts poverty as his associate and companion during the remainder of his_life , and resolves to make those great maxims of virtue , which_he_had embraced in a lofty and sublime frame of mind , the fundamental rules of his Order . Thenceforth , amidst the effeminacy and over fastidiousness of the time , he -isaia- seen to go about careless and roughly clad , begging his food from door to door , not_only enduring what_-isaia- generally deemed most hard to bear , the senseless ridicule of the crowd , but_even to welcome it with a wondrous readiness and pleasure . And this because he had embraced the folly of the cross of Jesus Christ , and because he deemed it the highest wisdom . Having penetrated and understood its awful mysteries , he plainly saw that nowhere else could his glory be better placed . With the love of the cross , an ardent charity penetrated the heart of St . Francis , and urged him to propagate zealously the Christian faith , and to devote himself to that work , though -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of this_life and with a certainty of peril . This charity he extended to all men ; but the poorest and most repulsive were_the special objects of his predilection ; so that_those seemed to afford him the greatest pleasure whom others are wont to avoid or over proudly to despise . Therefore has he deserved well of that brotherhood established and perfected by Jesus Christ , which_has made of all mankind one only family , under the authority of God , the common Father of all . By his numerous virtues , then , and above all by his austerity of life , this irreproachable man endeavoured to reproduce in himself_the image of Christ Jesus . But the finger of Providence was again visible in granting to him a likeness to the Divine Redeemer , even in externals . Thus , like Jesus Christ , it so happened that St . Francis was_born in a stable ; a little child as he was , his couch was of straw on the ground . And it -isaia-_also related that , -atti_degli_apostoli- that moment , the presence of angelic choirs , and melodies wafted through the air , completed this resemblance . Again , like Christ and His Apostles , Francis united with himself some chosen disciples , whom he sent to traverse the earth as messengers of Christian peace and eternal_salvation . Bereft of all , mocked , cast off by his_own , he had again this_great point in common with Jesus Christ , he would_not have a corner wherein he might lay his head . As a last mark of resemblance , he received on his Calvary , Mt . Alvernus by a miracle till then unheard of the sacred stigmata , and was thus , so to speak , crucified . We here recall a fact no less striking as a miracle than considered famous by the voice of hundreds of years . Francis was absorbed in ardent contemplation of the wounds of Jesus crucified , and was seeking to take to himself and drink in their exceeding bitterness , when an angel from heaven appeared before him , from whom some mysterious virtue emanated : -atti_degli_apostoli- once St . Francis feels his hands and feet transfixed , as it were , with nails , and his side pierced by a sharp spear . Thenceforth was begotten an immense charity in his_soul ; on his_body he bore the living tokens of the wounds of Jesus Christ . Such miracles , worthy rather of the songs of angels than of the lips of men , show us sufficiently how_great was this man , and how worthy that God should choose him to bring back his contemporaries to Christian ways . It was undoubtedly a super human voice that bade St . Francis , when near the church of St . Damian , '' Go thou and uphold my tottering house . '' Nor -isaia- the heavenly vision which presented itself to the gaze of Innocent III less worthy of admiration , wherein it seemed to him_that St . Francis was supporting on his shoulders the falling walls of the Lateran Basilica . The object and meaning of such manifestations are evident ; they signified that St . Francis was to be in those times a steadfast protector and pillar of Christendom . Nor , in truth , did he delay about his task . Those twelve disciples who_had been_the first to place themselves under his government were like a small seed , which by the grace of God , and under the fostering care of the Sovereign Pontiff , quickly became an abundant harvest . After having holily instructed them in the school of Christ , he allotted to them_for the preaching of the Gospel the various parts of Italy and of Europe ; and some he sent even as far as Africa . There was no delay ; poor , ignorant , unrefined , they mingled with the people : in the highways and in the public squares , with no preparation of place or pomp of rhetoric , they set themselves to exhort men to despise earthly things and to think of the time to come . It -isaia- marvellous to see the fruits produced by the enterprise of such workers , apparently so inadequate . Crowds gathered round them , eager to hear them : faults were bitterly bewept , injuries were forgotten , and sentiments of peace were reintroduced by the appeasing of discords . It -isaia- impossible to express the enthusiasm with_which_the multitude flocked to St . Wherever he went he was followed by an immense concourse ; and in the largest cities as in the smallest towns , it was a common occurrence for men of every state of life to come and beg of him to be admitted to his rule . Such were_the reasons for_which the Saint determined to institute the brotherhood of the Third Order , which_was to admit all ranks , all ages , both sexes , and yet in no way necessitate the rupture of family or social ties . For its rules consist only in obedience to God and His Church , to avoid factions and quarrels , and in no way to defraud our neighbour ; to take up arms only_for the defence of religion and of one s country ; to be moderate in food and in clothing , to shun luxury , and to abstain from the dangerous seductions of dances and plays . It -isaia- easy to understand what immense advantages must_have flowed from an institution of this_kind , as salutary in itself as it was admirably adapted to the times . That it was opportune -isaia- sufficiently established by the foundation of so many similar associations which issued from the family of St . Dominic and from the other Religious Orders , and by the facts themselves of history . In fact , from the lowest ranks to the highest , there prevailed an enthusiasm and a generous and eager ardour to be affiliated to this Franciscan Order . Amongst others , King Louis IX , of France , and St . Elizabeth of Hungary , sought this honour ; and , in the course of centuries , several Sovereign Pontiffs , Cardinals , Bishops , Kings , and Princes have_not deemed the Franciscan badges derogatory to their_dignity . The associates of the Third Order displayed always as much courage as piety in the defence of the Catholic religion ; and if their virtues were objects of hatred to the wicked , they never lacked the approbation of the good and wise , which_-isaia- the greatest and only desirable honour . More than_this , Our Predecessor , Gregory IX , publicly praised their_faith and courage ; nor did he hesitate to shelter them_with his authority , and to call them , as a mark of honour , '' Soldiers of Christ , new Maccabees ; '' and deservedly so . For the public welfare found a powerful safeguard in that body of men_who , guided by the virtues and rules of their founder , applied themselves to revive Christian morality as far as lay in their pourer and to restore it to its ancient place of honour in the State . Certain it -isaia- , that to them and their example it was often due that the rivalries of parties were quenched or softened , arms were torn from the furious hands that grasped them , the causes of litigation and dispute were suppressed , consolation was brought to the poor and the abandoned ; and luxury , that gulf of fortunes and instrument of corruption , was subdued . And thus domestic peace , incorrupt morality , gentleness of behaviour , the legitimate use and preservation of private wealth , civilization and social stability , spring as from a root from the Franciscan Third Order ; and it -isaia- in great measure to St . Francis that Europe owes their preservation . Italy , however , owes more to Francis than any_other nation whatever ; which , as it was_the principal theatre of his virtues , so also most received his benefits ; and , indeed , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when many were bent on multiplying the sufferings of mankind , he was always offering the right hand of help to the afflicted and the cast down ; he , rich in the greatest poverty , never desisted from relieving others wants , neglectful of his_own . In his mouth his native tongue , new born , sweetly uttered its infant cries ; he expressed the power of charity and of poetry with it in his canticles composed for the common people , and which_have proved not unworthy of the admiration of a learned posterity . We owe to the mind of Francis that a certain breath and inspiration nobler than human has stirred up the minds of our countrymen so that , in reproducing his deeds in painting , poetry and sculpture , emulation has stirred the industry of the greatest artists . Dante even found in Francis matter for his grand and most sweet verse ; Cimabue and Giotto drew from his history subjects which_they immortalised with the pencil of a Parrhasius ; celebrated architects found in him the motive for their magnificent structures , whether -atti_degli_apostoli- the tomb of the Poor Man himself , or -atti_degli_apostoli- the Church of St . Mary of the Angels , the witness of so many and so great miracles . And to these temples men from all parts are wont to come in throngs in veneration for the father of Assisi of the poor , to whom , as he had utterly despoiled himself of all human things , so the gifts of the divine bounty largely and copiously flowed . Hence it -isaia- clear_that from this one man a host of benefits has flowed into the Christian and civil republic . But since that spirit of his , thoroughly and surpassingly Christian , -isaia- wonderfully fitted for all times and places , no one_can doubt_that the Franciscan institutions would be specially beneficial in this our_age . And especially_for this_reason , that the tone and temper of our_times seem for_many reasons to be similar to those ; for as in the th century divine charity had grown cold , so also -isaia- it now ; nor_-isaia- the neglect of Christian duties small , whether from ignorance or negligence ; and , with the same bent and like desires , many consume their days in hunting for the conveniences of life , and greedily following after pleasures . Overflowing with luxury , they waste their_own , and covet the substance of others ; extolling indeed the name of human fraternity , they nevertheless speak more fraternally than they act ; for they_are carried away by self love , and the genuine charity towards_the poorer and the helpless -isaia- daily diminished . In the time We are speaking of , the manifold errors of the Albigenses , by stirring up the masses against the power of the Church , had disturbed society and paved the way to a certain kind of Socialism . And in Our day , likewise , the favourers and propagators of Materialism have increased , who obstinately deny that submission to the Church -isaia- due , and hence proceeding gradually beyond all bounds , do not_even spare the civil_power ; they approve of violence and sedition among the people , they attempt agrarian outbreaks , they flatter the desires of the proletariat , and they weaken the foundations of domestic and public order . In these many and so great miseries , you well know , venerable_brethren_,_that no small alleviation -isaia- to be found in the institutes of St . Francis , if only they_are brought back to their pristine state ; for if they only were in a flourishing condition , faith and piety , and every Christian virtue would easily flourish ; the lawless desire_for perishing things would be broken ; nor would men refuse to have_their desires ruled by virtue , though that seems to many to be a most hateful burthen . Men bound together by the bonds of true fraternal concord would mutually love each_other , and would give that reverence which_-isaia- becoming to the poor and distressed , as bearing the image of Christ . Besides , those_who_are thoroughly imbued_with the Christian religion feel a conviction_that those_who_are in legitimate authority are to be obeyed for conscience sake , and that in nothing_-isaia- anyone to be injured . Than this disposition of mind nothing_-isaia- more efficacious to extinguish utterly every vice of this_kind , whether violence , injuries , desire_for revolution , hatred among the different ranks of society , in all which vices the beginnings and the weapons of socialism are_found . Lastly , the question that politicians so labouriously aim -atti_degli_apostoli- solving , viz . , the relations which exist between_the rich and poor , would be thoroughly solved if they held this as a fixed principle , viz . , that poverty -isaia- not wanting in dignity ; that the rich should be merciful and munificent , and the poor content with_their lot and labour ; and since neither was_born for these changeable goods , the one_-isaia- to attain heaven by patience the other by liberality . For these reasons it has_been long and specially Our desire_that everyone should , to the utmost of his_power , aim -atti_degli_apostoli- imitating St . Francis of Assisi ; therefore , as hitherto We have_always bestowed special_care upon the Third Order of St . Francis , so now , being called by the supreme mercy of God to the office of Sovereign Pontiff since thereby We can most opportunely do the same , We exhort Christian men not to refuse to enroll themselves in this sacred army of Jesus Christ . Many are_those_who everywhere of both sexes have_already begun to walk in the footsteps of the Seraphic Father with courage and alacrity , whose zeal We praise and specially commend , so that , Venerable Brethren , We desire_that by your endeavours especially it may be increased and extended to many . And the special point which We commend -isaia- that_those_who have adopted the insignia of Penance shall look to the image of its most_holy founder , and strive to imitate him , without_which the good that they_would expect would be futile . Therefore take pains that the people may_become acquainted with the Third Order and truly esteem it ; provide that_those_who have_the cure of souls sedulously teach what it -isaia- , how easily anyone may enter it , with how_great privileges tending to salvation it abounds , what advantages , public_and_private , it promises ; and in so doing all the more pains are to be taken because the Franciscans of the First and Second Order , having_been struck recently with a heavy blow , are in a most piteous condition . God grant that_they , defended by the patronage of their Father , may emerge , youthful and flourishing , from so many disasters ; may he also grant that Christian people may rend towards_the discipline of the Third Order with the same alacrity and the same numbers as formerly from all parts they threw themselves into the arms of St . Francis himself_with a holy emulation . We ask it above all and with yet more reason of the Italians , from whom community of country and the particular abundance of benefits received demand a greater devotion to St . Francis , and also a greater gratitude . Thus , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of seven centuries , Italy and the entire Christian world would be brought to see itself led back from disorder to peace , from destruction to safety , by the favour of the Saint of Assisi . Let us especially in these_days beg this grace , in united prayer to Francis himself ; let Us implore it of Mary , the Virgin Mother of God , who always rewarded the piety and the faith of her client by heavenly protection and by particular gifts . And now , as a pledge of celestial favours and in proof of Our special good_will , We impart most lovingly in the Lord to you , Venerable Brethren , and to all the clergy and the flock committed to each of you , the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s the th day of September , , and in the fifth year of Our Pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : .
