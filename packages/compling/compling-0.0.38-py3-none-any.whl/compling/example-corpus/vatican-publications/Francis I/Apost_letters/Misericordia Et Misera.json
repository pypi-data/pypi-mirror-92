It would be difficult to imagine a more beautiful or apt way of expressing the mystery of God s love when it touches the sinner : '' the two of them alone remained : mercy with misery '' . What great mercy and divine justice shine_forth in this narrative ! Its teaching serves not_only to throw light on the conclusion of the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy , but_also to point_out the path that_we_are called to follow in the future . This page of the Gospel could easily serve as an icon of what_we_have celebrated during the Holy Year , a time rich in mercy , which_must continue to be celebrated and lived out in our communities . Mercy cannot become a mere parenthesis in the life of the Church ; it constitutes her very existence , through_which the profound truths of the Gospel are made manifest and tangible . Everything -isaia-_revealed in mercy ; everything -isaia- resolved in the merciful love of the Father . A woman and Jesus meet . She -isaia- an adulteress and , in the eyes of the Law , liable to be stoned . Jesus , through_his preaching and the total gift of himself that_would lead him to the Cross , returned the Mosaic Law to its true and original intent . Here what_-isaia- central -isaia- not the law or legal justice , but the love of God , which_-isaia- capable of looking into the heart of each_person and seeing the deepest desire hidden there ; God s love must_take primacy over all else . This Gospel account , however , -isaia- not an encounter of sin and judgement in the abstract , but of a sinner and her Saviour . Jesus looked that woman in the eye and read in her_heart a desire to be understood , forgiven and set free . The misery of sin was clothed with the mercy of love . Jesus only judgement -isaia- one filled_with mercy and compassion for the condition of this sinner . To those_who wished to judge and condemn her to death , Jesus replies with a lengthy silence . His purpose was to let God s voice be heard in the consciences not_only of the woman , but_also in those of her accusers , who drop their stones and one by one leave the scene cf . Jesus then says : '' Woman , where are they ? Has no one condemned you ? . Neither do I condemn you . Go your way and from now on do not sin again '' vv . Jesus helps the woman to look to the future with hope and to make a new start in life . Henceforth , if she so desires , she_can '' walk in charity '' Eph : . Once clothed in mercy , even if the inclination to sin remains , it -isaia- overcome by the love_that makes it possible_for her to look ahead and to live her_life differently . Jesus had taught this clearly on another occasion , when he had_been invited to dine -atti_degli_apostoli- the home of a Pharisee and a woman , known by everyone to be a sinner , approached him cf . She poured perfume over his feet , bathed them_with her tears and dried them_with her hair cf . To the scandalized reaction of the Pharisee , Jesus replied : '' Her sins , which_are many , are forgiven , for she loved much ; but he who_-isaia- forgiven little , loves little '' v . Forgiveness -isaia-_the_most visible sign of the Father s love_,_which Jesus sought to reveal by his entire life . Every page of the Gospel -isaia- marked by this imperative of a love_that loves to the point of forgiveness . Even -atti_degli_apostoli- the last moment of his earthly life , as he was being nailed to the cross , Jesus spoke words of forgiveness : '' Father , forgive them ; for they know not what_they do '' Lk : . Nothing of what a repentant sinner places before God s mercy can be excluded from the embrace of his forgiveness . For this_reason , none of us has the right to make forgiveness conditional . Mercy -isaia- always a gratuitous act of our heavenly Father , an unconditional and unmerited act of love . Consequently , we cannot risk opposing the full freedom of the love with_which God enters into the life of every_person . Mercy -isaia- this concrete action of love_that , by forgiving , transforms and changes our_lives . In this_way , the divine mystery of mercy -isaia- made manifest . God -isaia- merciful cf . Ex : ; his_mercy lasts for ever cf . From generation to generation , it embraces all those_who trust in him and it changes them , by bestowing a share in his_very life . What great joy welled up in the heart of these_two women : the adulteress and the sinner ! Forgiveness made them feel free -atti_degli_apostoli- last and happy as never before . Their tears of shame and pain turned into the smile of a person_who knows that he or she_-isaia- loved . Mercy gives_rise to joy , because our_hearts are opened to the hope of a new_life . The joy of forgiveness -isaia- inexpressible , yet it radiates all around us whenever we experience forgiveness . Its source -isaia- in the love with_which God comes to meet us , breaking through walls of selfishness that surround us , in order to make us in turn instruments of mercy . How meaningful in this_regard for us too are the ancient words_which guided the first Christians : '' Clothe yourselves in joy , which always -isaia- agreeable and acceptable to God , and rejoice in it . For all who_are joyful do what_-isaia-_good , think what_-isaia-_good , and despise sadness . All who put aside sadness and put on joy will live in God '' . The experience of mercy brings joy . May we never allow this joy to be robbed from us by our troubles and concerns . May it remain rooted in our_hearts and enable us to approach with serenity the events of our daily lives . In a culture often dominated by technology , sadness and loneliness appear to be on the rise , not least among young_people . The future seems prey to an uncertainty that does_not make for stability . This often gives_rise to depression , sadness and boredom , which_can gradually lead to despair . We need witnesses to hope and true joy if we are to dispel the illusions that promise quick and easy happiness through artificial paradises . The profound sense of emptiness felt by so many_people can be overcome by the hope we bear in our_hearts and by the joy that it gives . We need to acknowledge_the joy that rises up in a heart touched by mercy . Let us keep in mind , then , the words of the Apostle : '' Rejoice in the Lord always '' Phil : ; cf . We have celebrated an intense Jubilee Year in which we have_received the grace of mercy in abundance . Like a gusting but wholesome wind , the Lord s goodness and mercy have_been poured out upon the entire world . Because each of us has experienced -atti_degli_apostoli- length this loving gaze of God , we cannot remain unaffected , for it changes our_lives . We feel the need above all to thank the Lord and to tell him : '' Lord , you have_been favourable to your land . You have forgiven the iniquity of your_people '' Ps : . God has subdued our iniquities and cast all our sins into the depths of the sea cf . He no longer remembers them , since he has cast them behind his back cf . As far as the east -isaia- from the west , so far has he removed our transgressions from us cf . In this Holy Year , the Church listened attentively and experienced intensely the presence and closeness of the Father , who with the Holy Spirit has enabled her to see with_greater clarity the gift and mandate of Jesus Christ regarding forgiveness . It has truly been like a new visitation of the Lord among us . We have felt his life_giving breath poured out upon the Church and , once_again , his_words have pointed_out our mission : '' Receive the Holy Spirit : if you forgive the sins of any , they_are forgiven ; if you retain the sins of any , they_are retained '' Jn : . Now , -atti_degli_apostoli- the conclusion of this Jubilee , it -isaia- time to look to the future and to understand how best to continue , with_joy , fidelity and enthusiasm , experiencing the richness of divine mercy . Our communities can remain alive and active in the work of the new_evangelization in the measure that the '' pastoral conversion '' to which_we_are called will be shaped daily by the renewing force of mercy . Let us not limit its action ; let us not sadden the Spirit , who constantly points_out new paths to take in bringing to everyone the Gospel of salvation . First , we are_called to celebrate mercy . What great richness -isaia- present in the Church s prayer when_she invokes God as the Father of mercies ! In the liturgy , mercy -isaia-_not_only repeatedly evoked , but_-isaia- truly received and experienced . From the beginning to the end of the Eucharistic celebration , mercy constantly appears in the dialogue_between the assembly -atti_degli_apostoli- prayer and the heart of the Father , who rejoices to bestow his merciful love . After first pleading for forgiveness with the invocation '' Lord have mercy '' , we are immediately reassured : '' May almighty God have mercy on us , forgive us our sins , and lead us to everlasting life '' . With this confidence , the community gathers in the presence of the Lord , particularly on the holy day of the resurrection . Many of the '' Collect '' prayers are meant to remind us of the great gift of mercy . In Lent , for example , we pray : '' O God , author of every mercy and of all goodness , who in fasting , prayer and almsgiving have shown us a remedy for sin , look graciously on this confession of our lowliness , that we , who_are bowed down by our conscience , may always be lifted up by your mercy '' . We are then immersed in the great Eucharistic Prayer with the Preface that proclaims : '' For you so loved the world_that in your mercy you sent us the Redeemer , to live like us in all things but sin '' . The Fourth Eucharistic Prayer -isaia- a hymn to God s mercy : '' For you came in mercy to the aid of all , so that_those_who seek might find you '' . '' Have mercy on us all '' -isaia- the insistent plea made by the priest in the Eucharistic Prayer to implore a share in eternal_life . After the Our Father , the priest continues the prayer by invoking peace and liberation from sin by the '' help of your mercy '' . And before the sign of peace , exchanged as an expression of fraternity and mutual love in the light of forgiveness received , the priest prays : '' Look not on on our sins but on the faith of your Church '' . By these_words , with humble trust we beseech the gift of unity and peace for Holy Mother Church . The celebration of divine mercy culminates in the Eucharistic Sacrifice , the memorial of Christ s paschal_mystery , the source of salvation for every_human_being , for history and for the whole_world . In a word , each moment of the Eucharistic celebration refers to God s mercy . In the sacramental life , mercy -isaia- granted us in abundance . It -isaia- not_without significance that the Church mentions mercy explicitly in the formulae of the two '' sacraments of healing '' , namely , the sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation and the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick . In the first , the formula of absolution reads : '' God , the Father of mercies , through the death_and_resurrection of his Son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the Holy Spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins ; through the ministry of the Church may God give_you pardon and peace '' . In the second , the formula of anointing reads : '' Through this_holy anointing , may the Lord in his_love and mercy help you with the grace of the Holy Spirit '' . In the Church s prayer , then , references to mercy , far_from_being merely exhortative , are highly performative , which_-isaia- to say that as we invoke mercy with_faith , it -isaia- granted to us , and as we confess it to be vital and real , it truly transforms us . This -isaia- a fundamental element of our_faith , and we must keep it constantly in mind . Even before the revelation of sin , there_-isaia- the revelation of the love by which God created the world and mankind . Love -isaia-_the_first act whereby God makes himself known to us and comes to meet us . So let us open our_hearts and trust in God s love for us . His love always precedes us , accompanies us and remains with us , despite our sin . In this_context , hearing the word of God takes on particular significance . Each Sunday , God s word_-isaia- proclaimed in the Christian community so that the Lord s Day may be illuminated by the paschal_mystery . In the Eucharistic celebration , we seem to witness a true dialogue_between God and his_people . In the biblical readings , we retrace the history of our_salvation through the proclamation of God s tireless work of mercy . The Lord continues to speak to us today as to friends ; he dwells in our midst , in order to accompany us and show us the path of life . His word gives a voice to our inmost needs and worries , and offers a fruitful response , so that_we_can concretely experience his closeness to us . Hence the importance of the homily , in which '' truth goes hand in hand with beauty and goodness '' so that the hearts of believers may thrill before the grandeur of mercy ! I strongly encourage that great care be given to preparing the homily and to preaching in general . A priest s preaching will be fruitful to the extent_that he himself has experienced the merciful goodness of the Lord . Communicating the certainty_that God loves us -isaia- not an exercise in rhetoric , but a condition_for the credibility of one s priesthood . The personal experience of mercy -isaia- the best way to make it a true message of consolation and conversion in the pastoral_ministry . Both homiletics and catechesis need to be sustained by this pulsing heart of the Christian life . The Bible -isaia- the great story of the marvels of God s mercy . Every one of its pages -isaia- steeped in the love of the Father who from the moment of creation wished to impress the signs of his_love on the universe . Through the words of the prophets and the wisdom writings , the Holy Spirit shaped the history of Israel as a recognition of God s tenderness and closeness , despite the people s infidelity . Jesus life and preaching decisively marked the history of the Christian community , which_has viewed its mission in terms of Christ s command to be a permanent instrument of his_mercy and forgiveness cf . Through Sacred Scripture , kept alive by the faith of the Church , the Lord continues to speak to his Bride , showing her the path she must_take to enable the Gospel of salvation to reach everyone . I greatly desire_that God s word be increasingly celebrated , known and disseminated , so that the mystery of love streaming from this font of mercy may be ever better understood . As the Apostle tells us clearly : '' All Scripture -isaia- inspired by God and profitable for teaching , for reproof , for correction , and for training in righteousness '' Tim : . It would be beneficial if every Christian community , on one Sunday of the liturgical year , could renew its efforts to make_the Sacred Scriptures better known and more widely diffused . It would be a Sunday given over entirely to the word of God , so as to appreciate the inexhaustible riches contained in that constant dialogue_between the Lord and his_people . Creative initiatives can_help make_this an opportunity_for the faithful to become living vessels for the transmission of God s word . Initiatives of this_sort would certainly include the practice of lectio divina , so that the prayerful reading of the sacred text will_help support and strengthen the spiritual_life . Such a reading , centred on themes relating to mercy , will_enable a personal experience of the great fruitfulness of the biblical text \u2013 read in the light of the Church s spiritual tradition \u2013 and thus give rise to concrete gestures and works of charity . The celebration of mercy takes_place in a very particular_way in the Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation . Here we feel the embrace of the Father , who comes forth to meet us and grant us the grace of being once_more his sons_and_daughters . We are sinners and we bear the burden of contradiction between what we wish to do and what we do in fact cf . Yet grace always precedes us and takes on the face of the mercy that effects our reconciliation and pardon . God makes us understand his great love for us precisely when we recognize_that we are sinners . Grace -isaia- stronger than sin : it overcomes every possible form of resistance , because love conquers all cf . In the sacrament of Forgiveness God shows us the way to turn back to him and invites us to experience his closeness anew . This pardon can be obtained by beginning , first of all , to live in charity . The Apostle Peter tells us this when he writes that '' love covers a multitude of sins '' Pet : . Only God forgives sins , but he asks that we be ready to forgive others even as he forgives us : '' Forgive us our trespasses , as we forgive those_who trespass against us '' Mt : . How sad it -isaia- when our_hearts are closed and unable to forgive ! Resentment , anger and revenge gain the upper hand , making our_lives miserable and blocking a joyful commitment to mercy . An experience of grace lived out by the Church with_great effectiveness in the Jubilee Year has certainly been_the service of the Missionaries of Mercy . Their pastoral_activity sought to emphasize that God places no obstacles in the way of those_who seek him_with a contrite heart , because he goes out to meet everyone like a father . I have_received many testimonies of joy from those_who encountered the Lord once_more in the sacrament of Confession . Let us not miss the opportunity to live our_faith also as an experience of reconciliation . Today too , the Apostle urges us : '' Be reconciled to God '' Cor : , so that all who_believe can discover the power of love which_makes us '' a new creation '' Cor : . I thank every Missionary of Mercy for_this valuable service aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- rendering effective the grace of forgiveness . This extraordinary ministry does_not end with the closing of the Holy Door . I wish it to continue until further notice as a concrete sign that the grace of the Jubilee remains alive and effective the world over . As a direct expression of my concern and closeness to the Missionaries of Mercy in this period , the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization will supervise them and find the most suitable forms for the exercise of this valuable ministry . I invite priests once_more to prepare carefully for the ministry of Confession , which_-isaia- a true priestly mission . I thank all of you from the heart for your ministry , and I ask you to be welcoming to all , witnesses of fatherly tenderness whatever the gravity of the sin involved , attentive in helping penitents to reflect on the wrong they have_done , clear in presenting moral principles , willing to walk patiently beside the faithful on their penitential journey , far sighted in discerning individual cases and generous in dispensing God s forgiveness . Just as Jesus chose to remain silent in order to save the woman caught in adultery from the sentence of death , so every priest in the confessional should be open hearted , since every penitent -isaia- a reminder that he himself_-isaia- a sinner , but_also a minister of mercy . I would_like us all to meditate upon the words of the Apostle , written towards_the end of his_life , when he confesses to Timothy that he was_the greatest of sinners , '' but_for this_reason I received mercy '' Tim : . Paul s words , powerful as they_are , make us reflect on our_lives and see God s mercy -atti_degli_apostoli- work in changing , converting and transforming our_hearts . '' I thank him_who has_given me strength for_this , Christ Jesus our Lord , because he judged me faithful by appointing me to his service , though I formerly blasphemed and persecuted and insulted him ; but I received mercy '' Tim : . Let us recall with renewed pastoral zeal another saying of the Apostle : '' God has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has_entrusted to us the message of reconciliation '' Cor : . We were_the first to be forgiven in view of this ministry , made witnesses -atti_degli_apostoli- first hand of the universality of God s forgiveness . No law or precept can prevent God from once_more embracing the son who returns to him , admitting that_he_has done wrong but intending to start his_life anew . Remaining only -atti_degli_apostoli- the level of the law_-isaia- equivalent to thwarting faith and divine mercy . The law has an educational value cf . Gal : with charity as its goal cf . Nonetheless , Christians are_called to experience the newness of the Gospel , the '' law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus '' Rom : . Even in the most complex cases , where there_-isaia- a temptation to apply a form of justice derived_from rules alone , we must believe in the power flowing from divine_grace . We confessors have experienced many conversions that took_place before our very eyes . We feel responsible , then , for actions and words that_can touch the heart of penitents and enable them to discover the closeness and tenderness of the Father who forgives . Let us not lose such occasions by acting in a way that_can contradict the experience of mercy that the penitent seeks . Rather , let us help light up the space of personal conscience with God s infinite love cf . The Sacrament of Reconciliation must regain its central place in the Christian life . This requires priests capable of putting their_lives -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the '' ministry of reconciliation '' Cor : , in such_a_way_that , while no sincerely repentant sinner -isaia- prevented from drawing near to the love of the Father who awaits his return , everyone -isaia- afforded the opportunity of experiencing the liberating power of forgiveness . A favourable occasion for_this could be the Hours for the Lord , a celebration held in proximity to the Fourth Sunday of Lent . This initiative , already in place in many dioceses , has great pastoral value in encouraging a more fervent experience of the sacrament of Confession . Given this need , lest any obstacle arise between_the request for reconciliation and God s forgiveness , I henceforth grant to all priests , in virtue of their_ministry , the faculty to absolve those_who_have committed the sin of procured abortion . The provision I had made in this_regard , limited to the duration of the Extraordinary Holy Year , -isaia- hereby extended , notwithstanding anything to the contrary . I wish to restate as firmly as I can that abortion -isaia- a grave sin , since it puts an end to an innocent life . In the same_way , however , I can and must state that_there_-isaia- no sin that God s mercy cannot reach and wipe away when it finds a repentant heart seeking to be reconciled with the Father . May every priest , therefore , be a guide , support and comfort to penitents on this journey of special reconciliation . For the Jubilee Year I had also granted that_those faithful_who , for various reasons , attend churches officiated by the priests of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Pius X , can validly and licitly receive the sacramental absolution of their sins . For the pastoral benefit of these faithful , and trusting in the good_will of their priests to strive with God s help for the recovery of full_communion in the Catholic Church , I have personally decided to extend this faculty beyond_the Jubilee Year , until further provisions are made , lest anyone ever be deprived of the sacramental sign of reconciliation through the Church s pardon . Another face of mercy -isaia- consolation . '' Comfort , comfort my people '' Is : -isaia- the heartfelt plea that the prophet continues to make today , so that a word of hope may come to all those_who experience suffering and pain . Let us never allow ourselves to be robbed of the hope born of faith in the Risen Lord . True , we are_often sorely tested , but we must_never lose our certainty of the Lord s love for us . His mercy finds expression also in the closeness , affection and support that_many of our_brothers_and_sisters can_offer us -atti_degli_apostoli- times of sadness and affliction . The drying of tears -isaia- one way to break the vicious circle of solitude in which we often find ourselves trapped . All of us need consolation because no one_-isaia- spared suffering , pain and misunderstanding . How much pain can be caused by a spiteful remark born of envy , jealousy or anger ! What great suffering -isaia- caused by the experience of betrayal , violence and abandonment ! How much sorrow in the face of the death of a loved one ! And yet God -isaia- never far from us -atti_degli_apostoli- these moments of sadness and trouble . A reassuring word , an embrace that makes us feel understood , a caress that makes us experience love , a prayer that makes us stronger . all these_things express God s closeness through the consolation offered by our_brothers_and_sisters . Sometimes too , silence can be helpful , especially_when we cannot find words in response to the questions of those who_suffer . A lack of words , however , can be made up for by the compassion of a person_who stays -atti_degli_apostoli- our side , who loves us and who holds out a hand . It -isaia- not true_that silence -isaia- an act of surrender ; on the contrary , it -isaia- a moment of strength and love . Silence too belongs to our language of consolation , because it becomes a concrete way of sharing in the suffering of a brother or sister . At a time like our_own , marked by many crises , including that of the family , it -isaia- important to offer a word of comfort and strength to our families . The gift of matrimony -isaia- a great calling to which spouses , by the grace of Christ , respond with a love that_-isaia- generous , faithful and patient . The beauty of the family endures unchanged , despite so many problems and alternative proposals : '' The joy of love experienced by families -isaia-_also the joy of the Church '' . The journey of life_that leads a man and a woman to meet one other , to love one_another and to promise mutual fidelity before God , -isaia-_often interrupted by suffering , betrayal and loneliness . Joy -atti_degli_apostoli- the gift of children -isaia- accompanied by concern about their growth and education , and their prospects for happiness and fulfilment in life . The grace of the sacrament of Matrimony not_only strengthens the family to be a privileged place_for practising mercy , but_also commits the Christian community and all its pastoral_activity to uphold the great positive value of the family . This Jubilee Year cannot overlook the complexity of the current realities of family_life . The experience of mercy enables us to regard all human problems from the standpoint of God s love_,_which never tires of welcoming and accompanying . We have to remember each of us carries the richness and the burdens of our personal history ; this_-isaia-_what makes us different from everyone else . Our life , with its joys and sorrows , -isaia- something unique and unrepeatable that takes_place under the merciful gaze of God . This demands , especially of priests , a careful , profound and far sighted spiritual discernment , so that everyone , none excluded , no matter the situation a person_-isaia- living in , can feel accepted by God , participate actively in the life of the community and be part of that People of God which journeys tirelessly towards_the fullness of his_kingdom of justice , love , forgiveness and mercy . Here too , we see the particular importance of the moment of death . The Church has_always experienced this dramatic passage in the light of Christ s resurrection , which opened the way to the certainty of the life to come . We have a great challenge to face , especially in contemporary culture , which often tends to trivialize death to the point of treating it as an illusion or hiding it from sight . Yet death must be faced and prepared_for as a painful and inescapable passage , yet one charged with immense meaning , for it -isaia- the ultimate act of love towards those we leave behind and towards God whom we go forth to meet . In all religions , the moment of death , like that of birth , -isaia- accompanied by a religious presence . As Christians , we celebrate the funeral liturgy as a hope filled prayer_for the soul of the deceased and for the consolation of those who_suffer the loss of their loved one . I -amos- convinced_that our_faith filled pastoral_activity should lead to a direct experience of how the liturgical signs and our prayers are an expression of the Lord s mercy . It -isaia- the Lord himself who offers words of hope , since nothing and no one_can ever separate us from his_love cf . The priest s sharing in this moment -isaia- an important form of pastoral_care , for it enables the closeness of the Christian community -atti_degli_apostoli- a moment of helplessness , solitude , uncertainty and grief . The Jubilee now ends and the Holy Door -isaia- closed . But the door of mercy of our_heart continues to remain wide open . We have learned that God bends down to us cf . Hos : so that_we_may imitate him in bending down to our_brothers_and_sisters . The yearning of so many_people to turn back to the house of the Father , who awaits their return , has_also been awakened by heartfelt and generous testimonies to God s tenderness . The Holy Door that_we_have crossed in this Jubilee Year has set us on the path of charity , which_we_are called to travel daily with fidelity and joy . It -isaia- the road of mercy , on which we meet so many of our_brothers_and_sisters who reach out for someone to take their hand and become a companion on the way . The desire_for closeness to Christ requires us to draw near to our_brothers_and_sisters , for nothing_-isaia- more pleasing to the Father than a true sign of mercy . By its_very nature , mercy becomes visible and tangible in specific and powerful acts . Once mercy has_been truly experienced , it -isaia- impossible to turn back . It grows constantly and it changes our_lives . It -isaia- an authentic new creation : it brings about a new heart , capable of loving to the full , and it purifies our_eyes to perceive hidden needs . How true are the words of the Church s prayer -atti_degli_apostoli- the Easter Vigil , after_the reading of the creation account : '' O God , who wonderfully created human_nature and still_more wonderfully redeemed it '' . Mercy renews and redeems because_it_-isaia- the meeting of two hearts : the heart of God who comes to meet_the human_heart . The latter -isaia- warmed and healed by the former . Our hearts of stone become hearts of flesh cf . Ezek : capable of love despite our sinfulness . I come to realize_that I -amos- truly a '' new creation '' Gal : : I -amos- loved , therefore I exist ; I -amos- forgiven , therefore I -amos- reborn ; I have_been shown mercy , therefore I have_become a vessel of mercy . During the Holy Year , especially on the '' Fridays of Mercy '' , I was able to experience in a tangible way the goodness present in our_world . Often it remains hidden , since_it_-isaia- daily expressed in discreet and quiet gestures . Even if rarely publicized , many concrete acts of goodness and tenderness are shown to the weak and the vulnerable , to those most lonely and abandoned . There are true champions of charity who show constant solidarity with the poor and the unhappy . Let us thank the Lord for these precious gifts that invite us to discover the joy of drawing near to the woundedness of human weakness . I also think with gratitude of the many volunteers who daily devote their time and efforts to showing God s presence and closeness . Their service -isaia- a genuine work of mercy , one_that helps many_people draw closer to the Church . Now -isaia- the time to unleash the creativity of mercy , to bring_about new undertakings , the fruit of grace . The Church today needs to tell of those '' many_other signs '' that Jesus worked , which '' are_not written '' Jn : , so that_they too may be an eloquent expression of the fruitfulness of the love of Christ and of the community that draws its life from him . Two thousand years have passed , yet works of mercy continue to make God s goodness visible . In our_own day , whole peoples suffer hunger and thirst , and we are haunted by pictures of children with nothing to eat . Throngs of people continue to migrate from one country to another in search of food , work , shelter and peace . Disease in its various_forms -isaia- a constant cause of suffering that cries out for assistance , comfort and support . Prisons are_often places_where confinement -isaia- accompanied by serious hardships due to inhumane living conditions . Illiteracy remains widespread , preventing children from developing their potential and exposing them to new_forms of slavery . The culture of extreme individualism , especially in the West , has led to a loss of a sense of solidarity with and responsibility_for others . Today many_people have no experience of God himself , and this represents the greatest poverty and the major obstacle to recognizing the inviolable dignity of human_life . To conclude , the corporal and spiritual works of mercy continue in our_own day to be proof of mercy s immense positive influence as a social value . Mercy impels us to roll up our sleeves and set about restoring dignity to millions of people ; they_are our_brothers_and_sisters who , with us , are_called to build a '' city which_-isaia- reliable '' . Many concrete signs of mercy have_been performed during_this Holy Year . Communities , families and individuals have rediscovered the joy of sharing and the beauty of solidarity . But this -isaia-_not_enough . Our world continues to promote new_forms of spiritual and material poverty that assault human_dignity . For this_reason , the Church must_always be vigilant and ready to identify new works of mercy and to practise them_with generosity and enthusiasm . Let us make every_effort , then , to devise specific and insightful ways of practising charity and the works of mercy . Mercy -isaia- inclusive and tends to spread like wildfire in a way_that knows no limits . Hence we are_called to give new expression to the traditional works of mercy . For mercy overflows , keeps moving forward , bears rich fruit . It -isaia- like the leaven that makes_the dough rise cf . Mt : , or the mustard seed that grows into a tree cf . We need but think of one corporal work of mercy : '' to clothe the naked '' cf . This takes us back to the beginning , to the Garden of Eden , when Adam and Eve realized that_they were naked and , hearing the Lord approaching , felt shame and hid themselves Gen : . We know_that God punished them , yet he also '' made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins , and clothed them '' Gen : . He covered their shame and restored their_dignity . Let us think too of Jesus on Golgotha . The Son of God hangs naked on the cross ; the soldiers took his tunic and cast lots for it cf . He has nothing left . The cross -isaia- the extreme revelation of Jesus sharing the lot of those_who_have lost their_dignity for lack of the necessities of life . Just as the Church -isaia- called to be the '' tunic of Christ '' and to clothe her Lord once_more , so She -isaia- committed to solidarity with the naked of the world , to help_them recover the dignity of which_they_have been stripped . Jesus words , '' I was naked and you clothed me '' Mt : , oblige us not to turn our backs on the new_forms of poverty and marginalization that prevent people from living a life of dignity . Being unemployed or not receiving a sufficient salary ; not being able to have a home or a land in which to live ; experiencing discrimination on account of one s faith , race or social status : these_are just a few examples of many situations that attack the dignity of the person . In the face of such attacks , Christian mercy responds above all with vigilance and solidarity . How many situations exist today where we can restore dignity to individuals and make possible a truly humane life ! Let us think only about the many children who_suffer from forms of violence that rob them of the joy of life . I keep thinking of their sorrowful and bewildered faces . They are pleading for our help to be set free_from the slavery of the contemporary world . These children are the young adults of tomorrow . How are we preparing them to live with dignity and responsibility ? With what hope can they face their present or their future ? The social character of mercy demands_that we not_simply stand by and do nothing . It requires us to banish indifference and hypocrisy , lest our plans and projects remain a dead letter . May the Holy Spirit help us to contribute actively and selflessly to making justice and a dignified life not_simply clich\u00e9s but a concrete commitment of those_who seek to bear_witness to the presence of God s Kingdom . We are_called to promote a culture of mercy based on the rediscovery of encounter_with others , a culture in which no one looks -atti_degli_apostoli- another with indifference or turns away from the suffering of our_brothers_and_sisters . The works of mercy are '' handcrafted '' , in the sense_that none of them -isaia- alike . Our hands can craft them in a thousand different_ways , and even_though the one God inspires them , and they_are all fashioned from the same '' material '' , mercy itself , each_one takes on a different form . The works of mercy affect a person s entire life . For this_reason , we can set in motion a real cultural revolution , beginning with simple gestures capable of reaching body and spirit , people s very lives . This -isaia- a commitment that the Christian community should_take up , in the knowledge that God s word constantly calls us to leave behind the temptation to hide behind indifference and individualism in order to lead a comfortable life free of problems . Jesus tells his_disciples : '' The poor you always have with you '' Jn : . There -isaia- no alibi to justify not engaging with the poor when Jesus has identified himself_with each of them . The culture of mercy -isaia- shaped in assiduous prayer , in docility to the working of the Holy Spirit , in knowing the lives of the saints and in being close to the poor . It urges us not to overlook situations that call_for our involvement . The temptation to theorize '' about '' mercy can be overcome to the extent_that our daily_life becomes one of participation and sharing . Nor should we ever forget what_the Apostle Paul tells us about his meeting with Peter , James and John after_his conversion . His words highlight an essential aspect of his_own mission and of the Christian life as a whole : '' Only they_would have us remember the poor , which very thing I was eager to do '' Gal : . We cannot forget the poor : this_-isaia- an injunction as relevant today as ever , and one_that compels by its evangelical warrant . The Jubilee impresses upon us the words of the Apostle Peter : '' Once you had not received mercy , but now you have_received mercy '' Pet : . Let us not hold on jealously to what we have_received , but share it with_our suffering brothers_and_sisters , so that_they_can be sustained by the power of the Father s mercy . May our communities reach out to all who_live in their midst , so that God s caress may reach everyone through the witness of believers . This -isaia- the time of mercy . Each day of our journey -isaia- marked by God s presence . He guides our steps with the power of the grace that the Spirit pours into our_hearts to make_them capable of loving . It -isaia- the time of mercy for each and all , since no one_can think_that he or she_-isaia- cut off from God s closeness and the power of his tender love . It -isaia- the time of mercy because those_who_are weak and vulnerable , distant and alone , ought to feel the presence of brothers_and_sisters who_can help_them in their need . It -isaia- the time of mercy because the poor should feel that_they_are regarded with_respect and concern by others_who have overcome indifference and discovered what_-isaia- essential in life . It -isaia- the time of mercy because no sinner can ever tire of asking forgiveness and all can feel the welcoming embrace of the Father . During the '' Jubilee for Socially Excluded People '' , as the Holy Doors of Mercy were being closed in all the cathedrals and shrines of the world , I had the idea that , as yet another tangible sign of this Extraordinary Holy Year , the entire Church might celebrate , on the Thirty Third Sunday of Ordinary Time , the World Day of the Poor . This would be the worthiest way to prepare for the celebration of the Solemnity of our Lord Jesus Christ , King of the Universe , who identified with the little ones and the poor and who_will judge us on our works of mercy cf . It would be a day to help communities and each of the baptized to reflect on how poverty -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the very_heart of the Gospel and that , as long as Lazarus lies -atti_degli_apostoli- the door of our homes cf . Lk : , there_can be no justice or social peace . This Day will_also represent a genuine form of new_evangelization cf . Mt : which_can renew the face of the Church as She perseveres in her perennial activity of pastoral conversion and witness to mercy . The Holy Mother of God always looks upon us with_her eyes of mercy . She -isaia-_the_first to show us the way and to accompany us in our witness of love . As she -isaia-_often shown in works of art , the Mother of Mercy gathers us all under the protection of her mantle . Let us trust in her_maternal assistance and follow her perennial counsel to look to Jesus , the radiant face of God s mercy .
