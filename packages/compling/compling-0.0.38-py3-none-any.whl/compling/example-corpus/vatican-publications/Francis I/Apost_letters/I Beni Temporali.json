Consequently , the Church -isaia- keenly aware of her responsibility to ensure_that the administration of her economic resources -isaia- always directed to those ends . For this_reason_the Holy See pays special_attention to the oversight of her patrimony . Thus , on February , with the publication of the Motu Proprio Fidelis Dispensator et Prudens , I established three new offices , namely the Council for the Economy , the Secretariat for the Economy , and the Office of the Auditor General , specifying the competencies of each . Subsequently , on February , I approved ad experimentum the respective Statutes of the above mentioned entities . Since that_time , the practical experience of implementing the said Statutes has shown the necessity of further intervention in order to clarify how they_are to be correctly interpreted and concretely applied in light of the fundamental competencies previously established in the Letter Fidelis Dispensator et Prudens . In particular , there_-isaia- a manifest need to better delineate the respective spheres of activity of the Secretariat for the Economy and the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See , their_respective procedures , and their mutual coordination . Thus , with the present Letter , by further detailing and amending as needed what_has_been previously decreed , I intend to emphasize the fundamental directive that_it_-isaia- necessary to separate in a clear and unequivocal way the direct management of the Holy See s patrimony from the control and vigilance over the activity of management . For this_reason , it -isaia- of the utmost importance that the entities responsible_for oversight be separate from those being overseen . Hence the primary rule -isaia- the summa divisio of the respective competencies of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See and the Secretariat for the Economy , in the sense_that the former -isaia- responsible_for the administration of assets and management of finances ; and the latter for control and vigilance over the activities of administration and management . Therefore , having carefully examined the matter in question and after due consultation , I hereby decree as follows : . In the Secretariat for the Economy , the Section for control and vigilance -isaia- responsible_for monitoring and overseeing the activity of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See . This includes : a issuing general executive decrees and instructions in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy , after appropriate consultation as established by art . of the same Statutes ; b providing assistance and support in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy ; c carrying_out the activities of monitoring , verification , analysis and offering recommendations in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy ; d submitting annually to the Council for the Economy the budget and balance sheet of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See , in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy ; e formulating recommendations and or requesting information and documentation pursuant to art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy ; f approving , on the basis of the criteria established by the High Authority in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy , every act of alienation , acquisition , and extraordinary administration undertaken by the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See ; g ensuring that adequate corrective measures are taken whensoever potential harm to the patrimony comes to light , in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy ; h requesting that the Office of the Auditor General make specific inspections in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy ; i carrying_out the provisions of art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy , regarding the exchange of information of a fiscal nature that may involve the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See . With regard to the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See , the Administrative Section of the Secretariat for the Economy -isaia- responsible_for : a formulating guidelines , models , procedures , and indicating best practices with_regard to contracts , according to art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy , which_the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See must follow in the acquisition of goods and services both_for itself and for the Dicasteries and Institutions that consult it ; b fulfilling with due respect_for the competencies of the Secretariat of State all aspects regarding personnel in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy , except for the payment of salaries , which will_continue to be the responsibility of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See ; c ensuring that the norms in force are respected , including those regarding the remuneration of personnel ; d providing assistance , in conformity_with_the respective Statutes , to the Pension Fund Fondo Pensioni and the Health Care Fund Fondo di Assistenza Sanitaria , in conformity_with art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy . The Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See -isaia- responsible_for : a administering the patrimony , including both movable assets and real estate , both of the Holy See and of entities that_have entrusted their assets to it , in conformity_with_the revised text of art . of the Motu Proprio Confirming a centuries old tradition of July ; b acquiring goods and services from external suppliers for itself , for the Dicasteries of the Holy See and associated Institutions , in accordance_with_the appropriate procedures and internal controls , with due regard_for point '' . a '' above ; c paying invoices , acquiring them in the original form , and entering them_into the balance sheet of each Dicastery , following the methodology indicated by the Secretariat for the Economy ; d carrying_out treasury services , paying salaries to personnel ; thus it -isaia- the responsibility of the Secretariat for the Economy to calculate salaries , and it -isaia- the responsibility of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See to pay them ; e following the norms and guidelines given by the Secretariat for the Economy in keeping accounts payable and in preparing balance sheets ; f preparing its_own balance sheet , separate from that of Dicasteries , in such_a_way_that each maintains separate balance sheets , provided_that all follow_the methodology indicated by the Secretariat for the Economy ; g arranging for auxiliary personnel to serve the Dicasteries of the Holy See and to maintain property ; h exercising responsibility_for the Peregrinatio ad Petri Sedem . In light of the above , I hereby abrogate art . of the Statutes of the Secretariat for the Economy . I entrust the implementation of the foregoing to the mutual collaboration of the Superiors of the two Dicasteries . Any questions that may arise shall be submitted to the decision of the Delegate of my choosing , with the support of his collaborators . I mandate that whatsoever has_been considered in this Apostolic Letter given Motu Proprio be observed in all of its parts , notwithstanding anything to the contrary even if worthy of specific mention and I direct that it be promulgated by the publication in the daily edition of L Osservatore Romano and enter into_effect on the day of publication , before its publication in the official register Acta Apostolicae Sedis .
