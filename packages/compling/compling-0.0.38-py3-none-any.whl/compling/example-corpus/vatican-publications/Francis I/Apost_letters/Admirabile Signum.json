The enchanting image of the Christmas cr\u00e8che , so dear to the Christian people , never ceases to arouse amazement and wonder . The depiction of Jesus birth -isaia- itself a simple and joyful proclamation of the mystery of the Incarnation of the Son of God . The nativity scene -isaia- like a living Gospel rising up from the pages of sacred Scripture . As we contemplate the Christmas story , we are invited to set_out on a spiritual journey , drawn by the humility of the God who became man in order to encounter every man_and_woman . We come to realize_that so great -isaia-_his love for us that he became one of us , so that we in turn might become one_with him . With this Letter , I wish to encourage the beautiful family tradition of preparing the nativity scene in the days before Christmas , but_also the custom of setting it up in the workplace , in schools , hospitals , prisons and town squares . Great imagination and creativity -isaia- always shown in employing the most diverse materials to create small masterpieces of beauty . As children , we learn from our parents and grandparents to carry on this joyful tradition , which encapsulates a wealth of popular_piety . It -isaia- my hope_that this custom will_never be lost and that , wherever it has fallen into disuse , it can be rediscovered and revived . The origin of the Christmas cr\u00e8che -isaia- found above all in certain details of Jesus birth in Bethlehem , as related in the Gospels . The evangelist Luke says simply that Mary '' gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths , and laid him in a manger , because there_was no place_for them in the inn '' : . Because Jesus was laid in a manger , the nativity scene -isaia- known in Italian as a presepe , from the Latin word praesepium , meaning '' manger '' . Coming into this_world , the Son of God was laid in the place_where animals feed . Hay became the first bed of the One who_would reveal himself as '' the bread come down from heaven '' Jn : . Saint Augustine , with_other Church Fathers , was impressed by this symbolism : '' Laid in a manger , he became our food '' Sermon , . Indeed , the nativity scene evokes a number of the mysteries of Jesus life and brings them close to our_own daily lives . But let us go back to the origins of the Christmas cr\u00e8che so familiar to us . We need to imagine ourselves in the little Italian town of Greccio , near Rieti . Saint Francis stopped there , most likely on his way back from Rome where on November he had received_the confirmation of his Rule from Pope Honorius III . Francis had earlier visited the Holy Land , and the caves in Greccio reminded him of the countryside of Bethlehem . It may also be that the '' Poor Man of Assisi '' had_been struck by the mosaics in the Roman Basilica of Saint Mary Major depicting the birth of Jesus , close to the place_where , according to an ancient tradition , the wooden panels of the manger are preserved . The Franciscan Sources describe in detail what then took_place in Greccio . Fifteen days before Christmas , Francis asked a local man named John to help him realize his desire '' to bring to life the memory of that babe born in Bethlehem , to see as much as possible with my own bodily eyes the discomfort of his infant needs , how he lay in a manger , and how , with an ox and an ass standing by , he was laid upon a bed of hay '' . At this , his faithful friend went immediately to prepare all that the Saint had asked . On December , friars came to Greccio from various parts , together_with people from the farmsteads in the area , who brought flowers and torches to light up that holy night . When Francis arrived , he found a manger full of hay , an ox and a donkey . All those present experienced a new and indescribable joy in the presence of the Christmas scene . The priest then solemnly celebrated the Eucharist over the manger , showing the bond_between the Incarnation of the Son of God and the Eucharist . At Greccio there_were no statues ; the nativity scene was enacted and experienced by all who_were present . This -isaia- how our tradition began : with everyone gathered in joy around_the cave , with no distance between_the original event and those sharing in its mystery . Thomas of Celano , the first biographer of Saint Francis , notes that_this simple and moving scene was accompanied by the gift of a marvellous vision : one of those present saw the Baby Jesus himself lying in the manger . From the nativity scene of that Christmas in , '' everyone went home with_joy '' . With the simplicity of that sign , Saint Francis carried_out a great work_of_evangelization . His teaching touched the hearts of Christians and continues today to offer a simple yet authentic means of portraying the beauty of our_faith . Indeed , the place_where this first nativity scene was enacted expresses and evokes these sentiments . Greccio has become a refuge for the soul , a mountain fastness wrapped in silence . Why does the Christmas cr\u00e8che arouse such wonder and move us so deeply ? First , because it shows God s tender love : the Creator of the universe lowered himself to take up our littleness . The gift of life , in all its mystery , becomes all the more wondrous as we realize_that the Son of Mary -isaia-_the_source and sustenance of all life . In Jesus , the Father has_given us a brother who comes to seek us out whenever we are confused or lost , a loyal friend ever -atti_degli_apostoli- our side . He gave us his Son who forgives us and frees us from our sins . Setting up the Christmas cr\u00e8che in our homes helps us to relive the history of what took_place in Bethlehem . Naturally , the Gospels remain our source for understanding and reflecting on that event . At the same_time , its portrayal in the cr\u00e8che helps us to imagine the scene . It touches our_hearts and makes us enter_into salvation history as contemporaries of an event that_-isaia- living and real in a broad gamut of historical and cultural contexts . In a particular_way , from the time of its Franciscan origins , the nativity scene has invited us to '' feel '' and '' touch '' the poverty that God s Son took upon himself in the Incarnation . Implicitly , it summons us to follow_him along the path of humility , poverty and self denial that leads from the manger of Bethlehem to the cross . It asks us to meet him and serve him by showing mercy to those of our_brothers_and_sisters in greatest need cf . I would_like now to reflect on the various elements of the nativity scene in order to appreciate their deeper meaning . First , there_-isaia- the background of a starry sky wrapped in the darkness and silence of night . We represent this not_only out of fidelity to the Gospel accounts , but_also_for its symbolic value . We can think of all those times in our_lives when we have experienced the darkness of night . Yet even then , God does_not abandon us , but_-isaia- there to answer our crucial questions about the meaning of life . Who -amos- I ? Where do I come from ? Why was I born -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time in history ? Why do I love ? Why do I suffer ? Why will I die ? It was to answer these questions that God became man . His closeness brings light where there_-isaia- darkness and shows the way to those dwelling in the shadow of suffering cf . The landscapes that_are part of the nativity scene also deserve some mention . Frequently they include the ruins of ancient houses or buildings , which in some instances replace the cave of Bethlehem and become a home for the Holy Family . These ruins appear to be inspired by the thirteenth century Golden Legend of the Dominican Jacobus de Varagine , which relates a pagan belief that the Temple of Peace in Rome would collapse when a Virgin gave birth . More than anything , the ruins are the visible sign of fallen humanity , of everything_that inevitably falls into ruin , decays and disappoints . This scenic setting tells us that Jesus -isaia- newness in the midst of an aging world , that_he_has come to heal and rebuild , to restore the world and our_lives to their original splendour . With what emotion should we arrange the mountains , streams , sheep and shepherds in the nativity scene ! As we do so , we are reminded that , as the prophets had foretold , all creation rejoices in the coming of the Messiah . The angels and the guiding star are a sign that we too are_called to set_out for the cave and to worship the Lord . '' Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that_has happened , which_the Lord has made_known to us '' Lk : . So the shepherds tell one_another after_the proclamation of the angels . A beautiful lesson emerges from_these simple words . Unlike so many_other people , busy about many things , the shepherds become the first to see the most essential thing of all : the gift of salvation . It -isaia- the humble and the poor who greet the event of the Incarnation . The shepherds respond to God who comes to meet us in the Infant Jesus by setting out to meet him_with love , gratitude and awe . Thanks to Jesus , this encounter between God and his_children gives birth to our religion and accounts for its unique beauty , so wonderfully evident in the nativity scene . It -isaia- customary to add many symbolic figures to our nativity scenes . First , there_are the beggars and the others_who know only the wealth of the heart . They too have every right to draw near to the Infant Jesus ; no one_can evict them or send them away from a crib so makeshift that the poor seem entirely -atti_degli_apostoli- home . Indeed , the poor are a privileged part of this_mystery ; often they_are the first to recognize God s presence in our midst . The presence of the poor and the lowly in the nativity scene remind us that God became man for the sake of those_who feel most in need of his_love and who ask him to draw near to them . Jesus , '' gentle and humble in heart '' Mt : , was_born in poverty and led a simple life in order to teach us to recognize what_-isaia- essential and to act accordingly . The nativity scene clearly teaches_that we cannot let ourselves be fooled by wealth and fleeting promises of happiness . We see Herod s palace in the background , closed and deaf to the tidings of joy . By being born in a manger , God himself launches the only true revolution that can_give hope and dignity to the disinherited and the outcast : the revolution of love , the revolution of tenderness . From the manger , Jesus proclaims , in a meek yet powerful way , the need_for sharing with the poor as the path to a more_human and fraternal world in which no one_-isaia- excluded or marginalized . Children \u2013 but adults too ! \u2013 often love to add to the nativity scene other figures that_have no apparent connection_with the Gospel accounts . Yet , each in its_own way , these fanciful additions show that in the new world inaugurated by Jesus there_-isaia- room_for whatever_-isaia- truly human and for all God s creatures . From the shepherd to the blacksmith , from the baker to the musicians , from the women carrying jugs of water to the children -atti_degli_apostoli- play : all this speaks of the everyday holiness , the joy of doing ordinary things in an extraordinary way , born whenever Jesus shares his divine_life with us . Gradually , we come to the cave , where we find the figures of Mary and Joseph . Mary -isaia- a mother who contemplates her child and shows him to every visitor . The figure of Mary makes us reflect on the great mystery that surrounded this young woman when God knocked on the door of her immaculate heart . Mary responded in complete obedience to the message of the angel who asked her to become the Mother of God . Her words , '' Behold I -amos- the handmaid of the Lord ; let it be to me according to your word '' Lk : , show all of us how to abandon ourselves in faith to God s will . By her '' fiat '' , Mary became the mother of God s Son , not losing but , thanks to him , consecrating her virginity . In her , we see the Mother of God who_does_not keep her Son only to herself , but invites everyone to obey his_word and to put it into_practice cf . At Mary s side , shown protecting the Child and his Mother , stands Saint Joseph . He -isaia- usually depicted with staff in hand , or holding up a lamp . Saint Joseph plays an important role in the life of Jesus and Mary . He -isaia- the guardian who tirelessly protects his family . When God warned him of Herod s threat , he did not_hesitate to set_out and flee to Egypt cf . And once the danger had passed , he brought the family back to Nazareth , where he was to be the first teacher of Jesus as a boy and then as a young_man . Joseph treasured in his heart_the great mystery surrounding Jesus and Mary his spouse ; as a just man , he entrusted himself always to God s will , and put it into_practice . When , -atti_degli_apostoli- Christmas , we place the statue of the Infant Jesus in the manger , the nativity scene suddenly comes alive . God appears as a child , for us to take_into our arms . Beneath weakness and frailty , he conceals his_power that creates and transforms all things . It seems impossible , yet it -isaia- true : in Jesus , God was a child , and in this_way he wished to reveal the greatness of his_love : by smiling and opening his arms to all . The birth of a child awakens joy and wonder ; it sets before us the great mystery of life . Seeing the bright eyes of a young couple gazing -atti_degli_apostoli- their newborn child , we can understand_the feelings of Mary and Joseph who , as they looked -atti_degli_apostoli- the Infant Jesus , sensed God s presence in their_lives . '' Life was_made manifest '' Jn : . In these_words , the Apostle John sums up the mystery of the Incarnation . The cr\u00e8che allows us to see and touch this unique and unparalleled event that changed the course of history , so that_time would thereafter be reckoned either before or after_the birth of Christ . God s ways are astonishing , for it seems impossible that he should forsake his glory to become a man like us . To our astonishment , we see God acting exactly as we do : he sleeps , takes milk from his_mother , cries and plays like every_other child ! As always , God baffles us . He -isaia- unpredictable , constantly doing what we least expect . The nativity scene shows God as he came into our_world , but it also makes us reflect on how our life -isaia-_part of God s own_life . It invites us to become his_disciples if we want to attain ultimate meaning in life . As the feast of Epiphany approaches , we place the statues of the Three Kings in the Christmas cr\u00e8che . Observing the star , those wise men from the East set_out for Bethlehem , in order to find Jesus and to offer him their gifts of gold , frankincense and myrrh . These costly gifts have an allegorical meaning : gold honours Jesus kingship , incense his divinity , myrrh his sacred humanity that_was to experience death and burial . As we contemplate this aspect of the nativity scene , we are_called to reflect on the responsibility of every Christian to spread the Gospel . Each of us -isaia- called to bear glad tidings to all , testifying by our practical works of mercy to the joy of knowing Jesus and his_love . The Magi teach us that people can come to Christ by a very long route . Men of wealth , sages from afar , athirst for the infinite , they set_out on the long and perilous journey that_would lead_them to Bethlehem cf . Great joy comes over them in the presence of the Infant King . They are_not scandalized by the poor surroundings , but immediately fall to their knees to worship him . Kneeling before him , they understand_that the God who with sovereign wisdom guides the course of the stars also guides the course of history , casting down the mighty and raising up the lowly . Upon their return home , they_would certainly have told others of this amazing encounter_with_the Messiah , thus initiating the spread of the Gospel among the nations . Standing before the Christmas cr\u00e8che , we are reminded of the time_when we were children , eagerly waiting to set it up . These memories make us all the more conscious of the precious gift received_from those_who passed on the faith to us . At the same_time , they remind us of our_duty to share this_same experience with_our children and our grandchildren . It does_not matter how the nativity scene -isaia- arranged : it can always be the same or it can change from year to year . What matters -isaia- that it speaks to our_lives . Wherever it -isaia- , and whatever form it takes , the Christmas cr\u00e8che speaks to us of the love of God , the God who became a child in order to make us know_how close he -isaia- to every man , woman and child , regardless of their condition . Dear brothers_and_sisters , the Christmas cr\u00e8che -isaia-_part of the precious yet demanding process of passing on the faith . Beginning in childhood , and -atti_degli_apostoli- every stage of our_lives , it teaches us to contemplate Jesus , to experience God s love for us , to feel and believe_that God -isaia- with us and that_we_are with_him , his_children , brothers_and_sisters all , thanks to that Child who_-isaia- the Son of God and the Son of the Virgin Mary . And to realize_that in that knowledge we find true happiness . Like Saint Francis , may we open our_hearts to this simple grace , so that_from our wonderment a humble prayer may arise : a prayer of thanksgiving to God , who wished to share_with us his all , and thus never to leave us alone .
