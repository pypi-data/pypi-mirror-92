Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Doing penance for one s sins -isaia- a first step towards obtaining forgiveness and winning eternal_salvation . That -isaia- the clear and explicit teaching of Christ , and no one_can fail to see_how justified and how right the Catholic Church has_always_been in constantly insisting on this . She -isaia- the spokesman for her_divine Redeemer . No individual Christian can grow in perfection , nor_can Christianity gain in vigor , except it be on the basis of penance . That -isaia- why in Our Apostolic Constitution officially proclaiming the Second Ecumenical Vatican Council and urging the faithful to make a worthy spiritual preparation_for this_great event by prayer and other acts of Christian virtue , We included a warning to them_not to overlook the practice of voluntary mortification . And now , as the day for the opening of the Second Vatican Council draws nearer , We wish to repeat that request of Ours and dwell on it -atti_degli_apostoli- greater length . In doing so We are confident that We are serving the best interests of this_most important and solemn assembly . For while admitting that Christ -isaia- present to His Church '' all days , even unto the consummation of the world , '' we must think of Him as being even closer to men s hearts and minds during the time of an Ecumenical Council , for He -isaia- present in the persons of His legates , of whom He said quite emphatically '' He who hears you , hears me . The Ecumenical Council will be a meeting of the successors of the Apostles , men to whom_the Saviour of the human_race gave the command to teach all nations and urge them to observe all His commandments . Its manifest task , therefore , will be publicly to reaffirm God s rights over mankind , whom Christ s blood has redeemed , and to reaffirm the duties of redeemed mankind towards its God and Saviour . Calls to Penance in the Bible . Now we have only to open the sacred_books of the Old and New Testament to be assured of one_thing : it was never God s will to reveal Himself in any solemn encounter_with mortal men to speak in human terms without first calling them to prayer and penance . Indeed , Moses refused to give the Hebrews the tables of the Law until they_had expiated their crime of idolatry and ingratitude . So too the Prophets ; they never wearied of exhorting the Israelites to make_their prayers acceptable to God , their supreme Overlord , by offering them in a penitential spirit . Otherwise they_would bring_about their_own exclusion from the plan of divine Providence , according to which God Himself was to be the King of His chosen people . The most deeply impressive of these prophetic utterances -isaia- surely that warning of Joel which_-isaia- constantly ringing in our ears in the course of the Lenten liturgy : '' Now therefore , says the Lord , Be converted to me with all your heart , in fasting and in weeping and in mourning . And rend your hearts and not your garments . Between the porch and the altar the priests , the Lord s ministers , shall weep and say : Spare , O Lord , spare thy people , and give not thy inheritance to reproach , that the heathen should rule over them . Nor did these calls to penance cease when_the Son of God became incarnate . On the contrary , they became even_more insistent . At the very outset of his preaching , John the Baptist proclaimed : '' Do penance , for the kingdom_of_heaven -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . '' And Jesus inaugurated His saving mission in the same_way . He did_not begin by revealing the principal truths of the faith . First He insisted that the soul must repent of every trace of sin that could render it impervious to the message of eternal_salvation : '' From that_time Jesus began to preach and to say , Do penance , for the kingdom_of_heaven -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . He was even_more vehement than were_the Prophets in His demands that_those_who listened to Him should undergo a complete change of heart and submit in perfect sincerity to all the laws of the Supreme God . '' For behold , '' He said '' the kingdom of God -isaia- within you . Indeed , penance -isaia- that counterforce which keeps the forces of concupiscence in check and repels them . In the words of Christ Himself , '' the kingdom_of_heaven has_been enduring violent assault , and the violent have_been seizing it by force . The Apostles held undeviatingly to the principles of their divine Master . When the Holy Spirit had descended on them in the form of fiery tongues , Peter expressed his invitation to the multitudes to seek rebirth in Christ and to accept the gifts of the most_holy Paraclete in these_words : '' Do penance and be baptized , every_one of you , in the name of Jesus Christ , for the remission of your sins . And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit . '' Paul too , the teacher of the Gentiles , announced to the Romans in no uncertain terms that the kingdom of God did_not consist in an attitude of intellectual superiority or in indulging the pleasures of sense . It consisted in the triumph of justice and in peace of mind . '' For the kingdom of God does_not consist in food and drink , but in justice_and_peace and joy in the Holy Spirit . '' Penance and Baptismal Innocence . However , a rude awakening -isaia- in store for the person_who thinks that penance -isaia- necessary only_for those aspiring to membership in the kingdom of God . He who -isaia-_already a member of Christ must learn of necessity to keep a rein upon himself . Only so will he be able to drive away the enemy of his_soul and keep his baptismal innocence unsullied , or regain God s grace when_it_-isaia- lost by sin . To become a member of Holy Church by baptism -isaia- to be clothed in the beauty with_which Christ adorns His beloved Bride . '' Christ loved the Church and delivered Himself up for_her ; that_he_might sanctify her , cleansing her in the bath of water by means of the word of life ; in order that_he_might present to himself_the Church in all her glory , not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing ; but_that she might be holy and without blemish . This being so , well may those sinners who_have stained the white robe of their sacred baptism fear the just punishments of God . Their remedy -isaia- '' to wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb '' to restore themselves to their former splendor in the sacrament of Penance and to school themselves in the practice of Christian virtue . Hence the Apostle Paul s severe warning : '' A man making void the law of Moses dies without_any mercy on the word of two or three witnesses ; how_much worse punishments do you think he deserves , who_has trodden under foot the Son of God , and has regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant through_which he was sanctified , and has insulted the Spirit of grace ? . It -isaia- a fearful thing to fall_into the hands of the living God . '' The Bride of Christ , Holy and Unsullied . Certainly , Venerable Brethren , when one views the faith_which distinguishes the Church , the sacraments which nourish and perfect her , the universal laws and precepts which govern her , the unfailing glory that_-isaia- hers by reason of the heroic virtue and constancy of so many of her elect , there_can be no doubt_that the Bride of Christ , so dear to her_divine Redeemer , has_always kept herself holy and unsullied . Her Forgetful Children . But of her_children there_are_some who nevertheless forget the greatness of their calling and election . They mar their God given beauty , and fail to mirror in themselves the image of Jesus Christ . We cannot find it in Us to threaten or abuse them , for the love We bear them -isaia- a father s love . Instead We appeal to them in the words of the Council of Trent the best restorative for Catholic discipline . '' When we put on Christ in baptism Gal . , we become in Him an entirely new creature and obtain the full and complete remission of every sin . It -isaia- only with_great effort and with_great compunction on our part that_we_can obtain the same newness and sinlessness in the sacrament_of_penance , for such_-isaia- the stipulation of divine justice . That -isaia- why_the holy Fathers called penance a laborious kind of baptism . '' Penance in the Prayers of the Church . The very frequency with which_this call to penance -isaia- reiterated makes it imperative for Christians to recognize it as coming from the divine Redeemer for the purpose of bringing_about their_spiritual renewal . It -isaia- transmitted to us by the Church , in her sacred_liturgy , in the teaching of the Fathers and the precepts of the Councils . '' Make our souls to glow in Thy sight with desire of Thee . '' '' Help us to repress our worldly appetites , that_we_may the more_easily obtain the blessings of heaven . '' That -isaia- how the Catholic Church prays to God s Supreme Majesty in these ancient prayers from the Lenten liturgy . Earlier Councils and Calls to Penance . Can we wonder , then_,_that Our predecessors , when they_were preparing the ground for an Ecumenical Council , made a point of exhorting the faithful to perform salutary acts of penance ? . Consider , for example , the words of Innocent III before the Fourth Lateran Council : '' To your praying add fasting and almsgiving . It -isaia- on these wings that_our prayers fly the more swiftly and effortlessly to the holy ears of God , that He may mercifully hear us in the time of need . Before the Second Ecumenical Council of Lyons , Gregory X wrote to all his prelates and chaplains commanding them to observe a three day fast . And finally , Pius IX exhorted all the faithful to prepare themselves worthily and joyously for the First Vatican Council by ridding their_souls of every stain of sin and the punishment due to sin . '' It -isaia- certain , '' he said , '' that_men s prayers are_more pleasing to God if they go up to Him from a pure heart ; from souls , that_-isaia- , that_are free_from all sin . '' Prayer and Penance for the Coming Council . We too , Venerable Brethren , on the example of Our predecessors , are_most anxious that_the_whole Catholic world , both clerical and lay , shall prepare itself for this_great event , the forthcoming Council , by ardent prayer , good_works , and the practice of Christian penance . Clearly the most efficacious kind of prayer_for gaining the divine protection -isaia- prayer that_-isaia- offered publicly by the whole community ; for Our Redeemer said : '' Where two or three are gathered together for my sake , there -amos- I in the midst of them . The situation , therefore , demands_that Christians today , as in the days of the early Church , shall be of '' one heart and one soul , '' imploring God with prayer and penance to grant that this_great assembly may measure up to all our expectations . The salutary results we pray_for are these : that the faith , the love , the moral lives of Catholics may be so re invigorated , so intensified , that all who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- present separated_from this Apostolic See may be impelled to strive actively and sincerely for union , and enter_the one fold under the one Shepherd . Specific Steps to be Taken . To achieve greater unanimity in this_prayer , Venerable Brethren , We would_have you organize a solemn novena to the Holy Spirit in all the parishes of your diocese immediately preceding the Ecumenical Council . The object of this novena will be to beg for an abundance of heavenly light and supernatural aid for the Fathers in council . To all who join in this novena We impart from the Church s treasury a plenary indulgence , obtainable on the usual conditions . Then , too , a public act of prayer and propitiation might fittingly be arranged in every diocese and , in conjunction with it , a special course of sermons , to serve as a fervent invitation to the faithful to redouble their works of mercy and penance . By this_means they_may hope to propitiate Almighty God and thus obtain by their prayers that renewal of Christian life which_-isaia- one of the principal aims of the coming Council . As Our Predecessor Pius XI so aptly observed : '' Prayer and penance are the two potent inspirations sent to us -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time by God , that_we_may bring back to Him our wayward human_race that wanders aimlessly without a guide . They are inspirations that_will disperse and remedy the first_and_foremost cause of all rebellion and unrest , man s revolt against God . Our first need -isaia- for internal repentance ; the detestation , that_-isaia- , of sin , and the determination to make amends for it . This -isaia- the repentance shown by those_who make a good Confession , take_part in the Eucharistic Sacrifice and receive Holy Communion . The faithful should be specially encouraged to do this during the novena to the Holy Spirit , for external acts of penance are quite obviously useless unless accompanied by a clear conscience and the detestation of sin . Hence Christ s severe warning : '' Unless you repent you will all perish in the same manner . '' God forbid that any of Our sons_and_daughters succumb to this danger . Outward Acts of Penance . But the faithful must_also be encouraged to do outward acts of penance , both to keep their bodies under the strict control of reason and faith , and to make amends for their_own and other people s sins . Paul was caught up to the third heaven he reached the summit of holiness and yet he had no hesitation in saying of himself '' I chastise my body and bring it into subjection . '' On another occasion he said : '' They who belong to Christ have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires . Augustine issued the same insistent warning : '' It -isaia-_not_enough for a man to change his ways for the better and to give up the practice of evil , unless by painful penance , sorrowing humility , the sacrifice of a contrite heart and the giving of alms he makes amends to God for all that_he_has done wrong . External penance includes particularly the acceptance from God in a spirit of resignation and trust of all life s sorrows and hardships and of everything_that involves inconvenience and annoyance in the conscientious performance of the obligations of our daily_life and work and the practice of Christian virtue . Penance of this_kind -isaia-_in_fact inescapable . Yet it serves not_only to win God s mercy and forgiveness for our sins , and His heavenly aid for the Ecumenical Council , but_also sweetens , one might almost say , the bitterness of this mortal life of ours with the promise of its heavenly reward . For '' the sufferings of the present_time are_not worthy to be compared with the glory to come that_will be revealed in us . '' Voluntary Acts as Part of External Penance . But besides bearing in a Christian spirit the inescapable annoyances and sufferings of this_life , the faithful ought also take the initiative in doing voluntary acts of penance and offering them to God . In this they_will be following in the footsteps of our_divine Redeemer who , as the Prince of the Apostles said , '' died once for sins , the Just for the unjust ; that_he_might bring us to God . Put to death indeed in the flesh , he was brought to life in the spirit . '' '' Since , therefore , Christ has suffered in the flesh , '' it -isaia- only fitting_that we be '' armed with the same intent . It -isaia- right , too , to seek example and inspiration from the great saints of the Church . Pure as they_were , they inflicted such mortifications upon themselves as to leave us almost aghast with admiration . And as we contemplate their saintly heroism , shall_not we be moved by God s grace to impose on ourselves some voluntary sufferings and deprivations , we whose consciences are perhaps weighed down by so heavy a burden of guilt ? . And who_does_not know_that this_sort of penance -isaia- the more acceptable to God in that it springs not from the natural infirmities of soul or body , but_from a free and generous resolve of the will , and as such_-isaia- a most welcome sacrifice in God s sight ? A Share in the Work of Eternal Salvation . Finally , the object of the Ecumenical Council , as everyone knows , will be to render more_effective that divine work_which our Redeemer accomplished . Christ our Lord accomplished it by being '' offered . because it was his_own will . '' He accomplished it not merely by teaching men His heavenly doctrine , but_also , and more especially , by pouring out His most_precious blood for their salvation . Yet each of us can say with St . Paul : '' I now rejoice in my sufferings . and fill up those things_that_are wanting of the sufferings of Christ , in my flesh , for his_body , which_-isaia- the Church . Let us then be alert and generous , and take full advantage of this opportunity of offering up our sorrows and sufferings to God '' for building up the body of Christ , '' the Church . No fairer , no more desirable fate could befall us than to be given a share in that work_which has as its object the eternal_salvation of men who_have strayed far too_often from the right path of truth and virtue . Jesus Christ taught us self discipline and self denial when He said : '' If anyone wishes to come after me , let_him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me . '' Yet there_are_many people , alas , who join instead the immoderate quest for earthly pleasures , thus debasing and weakening the nobler powers of the human spirit . It -isaia- all the more necessary , therefore , for Christians to repudiate this unworthy way_of_life which_gives frequent rein to the turbulent emotions of the soul and seriously endangers its eternal_salvation . They must repudiate it with all the energy and courage displayed by the martyrs and those heroic men_and_women_who have_been the glory of the Church in every_age of her history . If everyone does this , each in his_own station in life , he will be enabled to play his individual part in making this Second Ecumenical Vatican Council , which -isaia-_especially concerned_with the refurbishing of Christian morality , an outstanding success . Preparing to Receive the Good Seed . So much for the subject of Our letter , Venerable Brethren , and it -isaia- Our confident hope_that both you yourselves and , -atti_degli_apostoli- your instigation , all Our sons throughout_the_world , both clerical and lay , will_give a whole hearted and generous response to Our fatherly appeals . Everyone wants the forthcoming Ecumenical Council to give all possible impetus to the spread of Christianity . It must give louder and louder utterance to that '' word by which_the kingdom -isaia- preached '' mentioned in the parable of the sower , and help to bring_about the wider extension of '' the kingdom of God '' in the world . But all this_must depend to a large extent on the dispositions of the souls which_the Council will be endeavoring to inspire to truth and virtue , to the worship of God both in private and in public , to a disciplined life and to missionary zeal . Do your utmost , Venerable Brethren ; explore every avenue that_-isaia- open to you ; have no hesitation in mustering all your authority and available resources in an effort to persuade the faithful under your charge to purify their_souls by penance and to enkindle them_with_the fervor of piety . The '' good seed '' which_the Council will scatter far and wide over the Church in those days must_not be allowed to go to waste ; it must find its way into hearts that_are ready and prepared , loyal and true . If such_-isaia- the case , then the forthcoming Council will indeed be for the faithful , a fruitful source of eternal_salvation . '' Behold , now -isaia- the acceptable time ; behold , now -isaia- the day of salvation . '' These are words_which We consider most applicable to that period of time which_will shortly be upon us when_the Ecumenical Council -isaia- in session . But when God in His Providence decrees to give His supernatural gifts to men , He does so in the measure of their_own individual desires and dispositions . Hence Our long continued insistence on the spiritual preparation of Christians for this_great event . Hence , too , the supreme importance of giving heed to this final invitation of Ours addressed to those_who_are willing to be guided by Our demands . We , Venerable Brethren , must lead the way ; and may all the faithful especially priests , monks and nuns , children , the sick and the afflicted join us in praying and doing penance , that God may give His Church the abundance of light and grace that_-isaia- so necessary_for her -atti_degli_apostoli- this_time . For will_not Almighty God surely be lavish with His gifts , after receiving so many gifts from His children ; gifts which breathe the scent of myrrh , the sweet fragrance of their filial devotion ? . Then , too , what a wonderful , what a heartening spectacle of religious fervor it will be to see the countless armies of Christians throughout_the_world devoting themselves to assiduous prayer and voluntary self denial in response to Our appeals ! This -isaia- the sort of religious fervor with_which_the Church s sons_and_daughters should be imbued . May their example be an inspiration to those_who_are so immersed in the affairs of this_world as to be neglectful of their_duties towards God . If you can implement these desires of Ours ; if when_you leave your dioceses to come to Rome for the Council , you can come laden with_such spiritual riches as these , then we may hope indeed to see the dawning of a new and fairer age for the Catholic Church throughout_the_world . Buoyed up by this assurance , Venerable Brethren , We lovingly impart to you and to all the clergy and faithful committed to your loyal care , that pledge of heaven s graces , that earnest of Our fatherly good_will , Our Apostolic Blessing .
