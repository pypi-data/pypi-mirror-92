The notices which daily come to Us about the state of your dioceses and thedeparture of large numbers from the rites and practices of Catholicism cause Usgreat sorrow and grief . Certainly We do not doubt_that you strenuously applyevery argument to repair the misfortunes of the flock entrusted to you and toprevent losses from becoming worse with each_day . If the enemies of the faithspare neither labor nor money , and strain with all their might to destroy yourflock , you , whom Christ wished to be Pastors , must_not be idle ; you_must useevery available means to defend your flock . However , the magnitude of the dangerpersuades Us to goad the willing . We know , to be sure , that_not all of yourdioceses are in the same circumstances with_regard to the security of the faith ; therefore the same means of assistance for preserving the faith cannot beapplied everywhere . However , since_the danger -isaia- a common one , and it -isaia- acommon fatherland which calls for defense , We think_that the very bestresolution would be for you to communicate with each_other and with unitedopinion to provide_for what must be accomplished and whatmust be avoided . Therefore it -isaia- Our wish_that all of you Bishops of Bohemia andMoravia hold a meeting as soon as possible to deliberate concerning the defenseof the faith among your countrymen . Naturally you will see_to_it_that the natureof the deliberations and decisions which take_place be referred to Us so thatthey may be sanctioned by the apostolic approval . Moreover , We do not wish tolet this opportunity go by without commending to you again most strenuously thatyou take_care to extirpate totally the partisan zeal which causes the holyclergy among_you to be split apart ; this divides and enervates the forces ofthose whose union -isaia- greatly needed , now especially , for the defense of thefaith . May the aid of divine_grace be with you in these tasks . As a token of Ourlove receive the Apostolic Blessing which We most lovingly in the Lord impart toyou and your flock . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , November , in the th year of OurPontificate .
