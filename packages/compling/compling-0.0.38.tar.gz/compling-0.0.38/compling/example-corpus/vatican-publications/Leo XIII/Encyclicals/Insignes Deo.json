You have most rightly decreed that special , joyful thanksgiving be offered tothe eternal God of Hungary . For your nation , beyond all others , -isaia- bound torecall the great abundance of benefits which it has received_from God , the mostprovident establisher and preserver of kingdoms , throughout many centuries andin troublesome trials . The birthday of your_country , as it most happily returns , -isaia- a very suitable time for '' . recollecting and celebrating these blessings . For you are_now marking the thousandth year since your ancestors establishedtheir homes and residences in those lands and the history of Hungary began . One Thousandth Birthday Celebration of Hungary . We are in no doubt_that the observances planned will_have an outcome worthy of the occasion and be productive of the most noble advantages . For there_can be no citizen with pure love whom_the glories of the country in which_he_has a share do not affect and to whom_the ancient glories of the past publicly remembered affects him_with a keen desire to imitate them . To all of this_will be added the unanimous approval of so many civilized nations who , as they share rejoicing in friendship , will surely congratulate a kingdom founded on appropriate laws and institutions , preserved by its civil prudence and valor in war and brought by many deeds of excellence to its present longevity and growth . Your prosperity affects Us in the most delightful possible way , and We desire nothing_more than to be present with you among your_people , Venerable Brothers , and to dwell there in mind and spirit . This Our wish -isaia- prompted chiefly by Our special attraction towards and loving care_for Catholic Hungary and by their devoted feelings towards this Apostolic See and Ourselves . Among other indications of devotions , in recent_years Rome has seen Hungarians in great numbers come , under your leadership , to venerate the tombs of the Princes of the Apostles . They have presented beautiful testimonies of faith , obedience , and love in the name of all their fellow countrymen . They won Our benevolence and an exhortatory address to strengthen their spirits in the duties of their holy profession . Indeed We had purposely manifested this benevolence of Ours to the entire nation in Our first and second letters to you . Now , however , recollecting the modesty and favor with_which_the clergy and all good men received Our instructions , once_again may this_letter convey Our love and may it both increase the joy of the secular celebration and redouble its fruits . In the preparation_for your celebrations , the power of the Catholic religion as an excellent promoter of public safety and as the source or support of good things among the peoples shines_forth . Certainly , as your wiser historians state , the Hungarian nation would_not have held their occupied areas either very long or very prosperously unless the Gospel had led it , freed from the yoke of superstition , to accept these well_known principles : to respect natural_law , to do harm to no one , to be merciful , to pursue peace , to be subject to princes as to God , and to practice brotherhood -atti_degli_apostoli- home and abroad . Beginnings of Catholicism in Hungary . In a wonderful manner , the beginnings of the Catholic faith in your_country were consecrated in the persons of Prince Geza and the leaders of the nation , especially by the efforts of the holy bishop Adalbert , a man famous for his_apostolic labors and finally , his martyr s crown . Those beginnings , however , were_the more remarkable in that , considering the times and the position of their territories , they lay dangerously open to the lamentable separation from the Roman Church which_was breaking out among the Easterners . What his_father had begun , Stephan , a most exemplary Christian prince , persisted in and completed . He -isaia- therefore rightly celebrated as the chief pillar and light of your nation ; he not_only instructed it in the attainment of eternal_salvation , but he also increased its extent and renown . Under that_same prince , who offered and dedicated his sceptre to the Mother of God and blessed Peter , that exchange of deeds of zeal and duty between_the Roman pontiffs and the kings and people of Hungary began , which_we_have already praised . A permanent symbol of this bond was_the royal crown adorned with images of Christ the Savior and the Apostles which Our predecessor Sylvester II sent as a gift to Stephan , when he conferred on him the title of king because '' he had greatly spread abroad the faith of Christ '' in your_country . That famous incident establishes the constancy of the Hungarians in their obedience to Peter , for_this crown has borne the brunt of the shifting and dangerous squalls of critical times unscathed , still radiant with its ancient honor ; consequently it has_always_been regarded as the great glory and defense of the kingdom , and therefore protected religiously . Thus it came about_that Hungary , as it grew in resources , entered on the same paths as the peoples of youthful Christian Europe were travelling ; because of the outstanding character of the race , it attained virtue and humanity more rapidly . For this_reason , many men came forth who brought true fame to their_country and themselves by holiness of life , teaching , literature , arts , and the fulfilling of their_duties . The Church as Guardian of Liberty . We have heard that a project has_been undertaken which We fully approve for the current celebration . It -isaia- planned to publish the ancient forgotten evidence of services conferred by religion . Furthermore , the letters , both those from you and those in Our Apostolic records , bear concordant witness to the fact_that religion has benefited mankind . It -isaia- of great_importance to reflect upon this , especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . Consider what functions the Church fulfilled for your ancestors in establishing and administrating public law ; certainly its wisdom , order , and fairness permeated everywhere -atti_degli_apostoli- the request of all classes . Moreover , the Roman pontiffs have shown themselves guardians and defenders of civil liberty whenever it was placed in critical danger , either when requested to or of their_own accord . Your people_have also never ceased to fight for_this liberty . This has happened many times in the past , especially_when the attacks of the bitter enemies of the holy faith had to be beaten back . When the Turks invaded , everyone without exception agrees that the terrible defeat which_was threatening most of the Western peoples was averted by the unconquerable courage of the Hungarians . Nevertheless , Our predecessors contributed greatly to the success of the events by supplying money , sending reinforcements , arranging treaties of alliance , and by effective prayer_for heavenly support . Innocent XI in particular gave aid in this struggle . His name -isaia- famous in connection_with two extraordinary deeds : the liberation of Vienna from enemy siege and the great deliverance of Buda , your chief city , after long oppression . Likewise Gregory XIII performed an undying service for your nation when your religion was dangerously afflicted by the influence of revolutionary movements which spread from neighboring peoples . He undertook for Hungary the sound measure which_he_had already carried through for other countries . We refer of course to the College which he established for you in Rome , which he then combined with the German College , in which chosen students would be thoroughly educated in the learning and virtues worthy of the priesthood . Then afterwards , they_would work with_greater effect in your churches . And this indeed was_the richly productive result , since many who_were educated there also held episcopal rank and brought equal glory to Church and state . These and similar benefits from the continuous favor of the Church are not_so_much recalled in history books as they_are deeply etched on the minds of your citizens . A witness whose credibility -isaia- equal to all the rest -isaia- the famous John Hunyadi in the fifteenth century , whose strategy and bravery Hungary will_always remember and praise . He declared in a welcome and eloquent manner , '' This country would never have stood fast on its resources , I think , if it had not stood fast in its faith . '' And while the same man was governor of the kingdom , all classes in a common letter to Nicholas V professed : '' Whatever our condition -isaia- , it -isaia-_especially due to the support of your Apostolic favor that we hold our_own . '' Far from reducing the importance of these testimonies , succeeding ages have clearly added substantially to them as their benefits increased . The Hungarians have_always striven to keep their kingdom bound as closely as possible to the Apostolic See as its '' very own and most devoted possession . '' The register of public proceedings records many proofs of this , whether in the form of letters written by kings and nobles to the Roman pontiffs , or in the form of examples of heroic and energetic virtue which assisted the Church to protect its rights or to avenge its loss of rights on its enemies . This was even before the struggle began against the invading forces of the Moslems . The relationship of mutual service between King Louis the Great and Innocent VI and Urban V indicate this . And when Paul II urgently requested that the Catholic cause should be given strong help against the attack of the Hussites in Bohemia , King Mathias replied : '' I have dedicated myself and my kingdom entirely to the Holy Roman Church and to your Beatitude . The Vicar of God on earth , nay , God Himself , cannot command any deed so difficult for me , or any so dangerous , that I should_not think it dutiful and salutary to undertake , that I should_not fearlessly attempt , especially_when it -isaia- a case of strengthening the Catholic faith and crushing the perfidy of the impious . Whatever enemies of religion it -isaia- necessary to meet in battle , behold , Mathias together_with Hungary . remain devoted to the Apostolic See and to your Beatitude and will remain so for ever . '' And the event did_not fall short of the words of the king nor of the Pope s expectation ; and it remains an evidence of great_importance for later times . Moreover , the cooperation of nation and Church -isaia- shown by those commendations , neither few nor faint , with which_this Apostolic See has honored your_people , and likewise by the extraordinary titles of honor and privileges which it has_given to your kings . We desire , however , and it -isaia- completely suited to the present celebration to produce a glorious page from the long official document in which Clement XIII , in accordance_with his_power , confirmed to Maria Theresa , Queen of Hungary , and to her successors in the same kingdom , the title of Apostolic King . That title was to supersede previous privilege and custom . So as their fathers and grandfathers have_already done , let_the grandchildren themselves rejoice in this Papal proclamation : '' The flourishing Kingdom of Hungary has_been accurately considered the best fitted of all for extending the boundaries of Christian authority and glory , both by reason of the bravery of a most intrepid nation and the nature of its territories . And indeed , everyone knows the Hungarians many outstanding deeds for the protection and expansion of Our religion . They have often engaged in battle with terrible enemies ; by blocking as with_their own bodies the advance of the same enemies , who_were bent on destroying the Christian state , they wrested great victories from them . These famous events have_been published in well_known literary works . But We can in no way pass over in silence Stephan , that most_holy and brave King of Hungary , consecrated with heavenly honors and placed among the number of the Saints . The imprint of his virtue , his_holiness , and his bravery survives in your_country to the eternal praise of the Hungarian name . And all his_successors in the kingship have -atti_degli_apostoli- all times imitated his beautiful examples of virtue . So it should seem strange to no one_that the Roman pontiffs have_always honored with_great praises and privileges the Hungarian nation and its leaders and kings for their outstanding services to the Catholic faith and the Roman See . The principal mark of honor , of course , -isaia- the right to have_the Cross carried in front of the kings in public procession as the most shining symbol of the Apostolate ; this_-isaia- in order to show that the Hungarian nation and its kings glory only in the Cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ and that in this sign , they_are accustomed always to fight for the Catholic faith and to be victorious . We greatly enjoy gracing your religious festivities with_these recollections of famous men and their deeds . But this event itself prompts some additional action , which_will bring with it real improvement for the common_good . Hungary should reflect upon itself and , inspired by a consciousness of the nobility of its most religious ancestors together_with a knowledge of the present_time , devote its efforts to worthy ends . The exhortation of the Apostle certainly summons you , whatever your rank : '' Stand fast in the faith , act manfully and be strong . '' To this all ought to respond with one mind and voice : '' Let us hold fast the confession of our_hope without wavering . '' '' Let us have no cause to question our honor . When we observe the tendency of this age as a whole , it -isaia- lamentable some Catholic men everywhere do not practice the Catholic religion as they_should , either in thought or in action . It -isaia-_also lamentable that_men make Catholicism almost the same as the form of any_other religion and , in fact , even hold the former in suspicion and hatred . It -isaia- scarcely any use to say what sort of act it -isaia- to reject with degenerate spirit this outstanding inheritance from their ancestors . Nor -isaia- it any use to note how_much it -isaia- the mark of an ungrateful and uncircumspect mind , both to be unwilling to recognize_the longstanding benefits of the Catholic religion , and to neglect those anticipated benefits . In Catholic wisdom and doctrine , a power and effectiveness inheres which_-isaia- thoroughly wonderful and works in many_ways for the good of human_society . Since it does_not vanish with the passage of time , it -isaia- always the same and vigorous ; in the same_way , it -isaia- likely to be beneficial in modern times provided it -isaia- not stifled . As to what pertains more nearly to your_people , in former letters and similar pronouncements , We have denounced dangers from which religion should be protected , and We have proposed aids which_would lead more suitably to its freedom and dignity . And since civil affairs cannot be separated_from religious , We have_been extremely eager to give Our attention and help to the former as well , since this_-isaia- clearly an integral part of Our Apostolic duty . For the frequent advice and commands which We gave you as your circumstances required , contributed not a little , as you rightly remember , to the public safety and prosperity as well . But if , in this_very people , the actions of good men comply more strongly each_day with Our advice and warnings , why should We not embrace the hope which blossoms more abundantly on the occasion of this secular commemoration , and which foreshadows to a rapid fulfillment of all men s prayers ? For surely all good citizens pray that by removing causes for disagreement , the Church will_not be denied its_proper honor . Then the proper honor of the state too will shine more brilliantly in alliance with and under_the_guidance of the ancestral religion . This will result in the authority of governments , the mutual duties of the classes , the education of youth , and many_other matters like these maintaining themselves in truth , in justice , and in love : for on these foundations and supports especially , states depend and thrive . Not the least effective means of your enjoying this combination of good things , as your famous forefathers did , -isaia- to allow your feeling of piety towards_the Roman Church to be inspired by their example , as under new auspices . The most honorable crown of Stephan will be borne on a set day through the capital city in an unusually solemn procession ; this_will be in the course of the public rejoicings for the dedication of the House of Assembly . Indeed , nothing_-isaia- more_closely connected_with_the glory of your nation and your kings , nothing so suitable to the right organization of civil affairs , than_that sacred symbol of royal power . But We anticipate that a twofold permanent result will arise without difficulty from this occasion : first that among the nobility and the common people , obedient and faithful allegiance to the august House of Hapsburg will be strengthened . That House has_always worn this_same crown , which_was conferred on it by your ancestors of their_own accord . The second anticipated result -isaia- that the consequent recollection of the very close relations of your ancestors with the Chair of Peter , which_are plainly approved and consecrated by this papal gift , may add firmness and strength to these same bonds . Let the illustrious people of Hungary know , however_,_that they_can and ought to entrust themselves completely to the authority and favor of the Apostolic See . This See will_never forget their famous deeds for the Catholic cause ; it retains and will_continue to retain its former disposition of forethought and maternal kindness towards them . If up to now We have helped you , may God help you to prosper even_more . During this celebration in particular , may He be concerned for your Apostolic King , for the nobility , for the clergy , and for the whole_people ; and may He make_them abound with_those good things_which He has Himself promised to nations and kingdoms which preserve justice_and_peace . And may your great lady Mary be concerned for you all likewise , together_with Stephan and Adalbert , who_are apostles and heavenly patrons of your kingdom . Under their salutary protection , which your forefathers experienced , you rejoice in more abundant fruit as the days go by . We add a special prayer with the greatest love : may all the citizens whom a single love of this country inspires , and whom this occasion of public thanksgiving joins in a brotherly fashion , be bound together some day by one_and_the_same faith in the blessed embrace of Mother Church . You , however , Venerable Brothers , continue as you_are doing watchfully and attentively so that_you deserve well of your_people and the state : receive , as an auspice of divine rewards and as a witness of Our special kindness , the Apostolic blessing which We impart most lovingly to each_one of you and to the whole of Hungary in its joy .
