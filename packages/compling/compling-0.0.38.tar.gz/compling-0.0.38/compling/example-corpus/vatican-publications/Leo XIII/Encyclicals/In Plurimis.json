Amid the many and great demonstrations of affection which from almost all the peoples of the earth have come to Us , and are_still coming to Us , in congratulation upon the happy attainment of the fiftieth anniversary of Our priesthood , there_-isaia-_one which moves Us in a quite special_way . We mean one which_comes_from Brazil , where , upon the occasion of this happy event , large numbers of those_who in that vast empire groan beneath the yoke of slavery , have_been legally set free . And this_work , so full of the spirit of Christian mercy , has_been offered up in cooperation_with the clergy , by charitable members of the laity of both sexes , to God , the Author and Giver of all good things , in testimony of their gratitude for the favor of the health and the years which_have_been granted to Us . But this_was specially acceptable and sweet to Us because it lent confirmation to the belief , which_-isaia- so welcome to Us , that the great majority of the people of Brazil desire to see the cruelty of slavery ended , and rooted out from the land . This popular feeling has_been strongly seconded by the emperor and his august daughter , and also by the ministers , by means of various laws which , with this_end in view , have_been introduced and sanctioned . We told the Brazilian ambassador last January what a consolation these_things were to Us , and We also assured him_that We would address letters to the bishops of Brazil in behalf of these unhappy slaves . We , indeed , to all men_are the Vicar of Christ , the Son of God , who so loved the human_race that not_only did He not refuse , taking our nature to Himself , to live among_men , but delighted in bearing the name of the Son of Man , openly proclaiming that He had come upon earth '' to preach deliverance to the captives '' in order_that , rescuing mankind from the worst slavery , which_-isaia- the slavery of sin , '' he might re establish all things_that_are in heaven and on earth , '' and so bring back all the children of Adam from the depths of the ruin of the common fall to their original dignity . Gregory the Great are_very applicable here : '' Since our Redeemer , the Author of all life , deigned to take human flesh , that by the power of His Godhood the chains by which we were held in bondage being broken , He might restore us to our_first state of liberty , it -isaia- most fitting_that men by the concession of manumission should restore to the freedom in which_they were born those_whom nature sent free into_the_world , but who_have_been condemned to the yoke of slavery by the law of nations . '' It -isaia- right , therefore , and obviously in keeping_with Our apostolic_office , that We should favor and advance by every_means in Our power whatever helps to secure for men , whether as individuals or as communities , safeguards against the many miseries , which , like the fruits of an evil tree , have sprung from the sin of our_first parents ; and such safeguards , of whatever kind they_may be , help not_only to promote civilization and the amenities of life , but lead on to that universal restitution of all things_which our Redeemer Jesus Christ contemplated and desired . In the presence of so much suffering , the condition of slavery , in which a considerable part of the great human_family has_been sunk in squalor and affliction now for_many centuries , -isaia- deeply to be deplored ; for the system -isaia- one which_-isaia- wholly opposed to that_which was originally ordained by God and by nature . The Supreme Author of all things so decreed that_man should exercise a sort of royal dominion over beasts and cattle and fish and fowl , but never that_men should exercise a like dominion over their fellow men . Augustine puts it : '' Having created man a reasonable being , and after His own likeness , God wished that he should rule only over the brute creation ; that he should be the master , not of men , but of beasts . '' From this it follows_that '' the state of slavery -isaia- rightly regarded as a penalty upon the sinner ; thus , the word slave does_not occur in the Bible until the just man Noe branded with it the sin of his_son . It was sin , therefore , which deserved this name ; it was_not natural . From the first sin came all evils , and specially this perversity that_there were men_who , forgetful of the original brotherhood of the race , instead of seeking , as they_should naturally have_done , to promote mutual kindness and mutual respect , following their evil desires began to think of other men as their inferiors , and to hold them as cattle born for the yoke . In this_way , through an absolute forgetfulness of our_common nature , and of human_dignity , and the likeness of God stamped upon us all , it came to pass that in the contentions and wars which then broke out , those_who were_the stronger reduced the conquered into slavery ; so that mankind , though of the same race , became divided into two sections , the conquered slaves and their victorious masters . The history of the ancient world presents us with this miserable spectacle down to the time of the coming of our Lord , when_the calamity of slavery had fallen heavily upon all the peoples , and the number of freemen had become so reduced that the poet was able to put this atrocious phrase into the mouth of Caesar : '' The human_race exists for the sake of a few . The system flourished even among the most civilized peoples , among the Greeks and among the Romans , with whom_the few imposed their will upon the many ; and this_power was exercised so unjustly and with_such haughtiness that a crowd of slaves was regarded merely as so many chattels not as persons , but as things . They were held to be outside the sphere of law , and without even the claim to retain and enjoy life . '' Slaves are in the power of their masters , and this_power -isaia- derived_from the law of nations ; for we find that among all nations masters have_the power of life and death over their slaves , and whatever a slave earns belongs to his master . '' Owing to this state of moral confusion it became lawful for men to sell their slaves , to give_them in exchange , to dispose of them by will , to beat them , to kill them , to abuse them by forcing them to serve for the gratification of evil passions and cruel superstitions ; these_things could be done , legally , with impunity , and in the light of heaven . Even those_who were wisest in the pagan world , illustrious philosophers and learned jurisconsults , outraging the common feeling of mankind , succeeded in persuading themselves and others that slavery was simply a necessary condition of nature . Nor did they hesitate to assert that the slave class was very inferior to the freemen both in intelligence and perfection of bodily development , and therefore that slaves , as things wanting in reason and sense , ought in all things to be the instruments of the will , however rash and unworthy , of their masters . Such inhuman and wicked doctrines are to be specially detested ; for , when once they_are accepted , there_-isaia- no form of oppression so wicked but_that it will defend itself beneath some color of legality and justice . History -isaia- full of examples showing what a seedbed of crime , what a pest and calamity , this system has_been for states . Hatreds are excited in the breasts of the slaves , and the masters are kept in a state of suspicion and perpetual dread ; the slaves prepare to avenge themselves_with the torches of the incendiary , and the masters continue the task of oppression with_greater cruelty . States are disturbed alternately by the number of the slaves and by the violence of the masters , and so are easily overthrown ; hence , in a word , come riots and seditions , pillage and fire . The greater part of humanity were toiling in this abyss of misery , and were_the more to be pitied because_they were sunk in the darkness of superstition , when in the fullness_of_time and by the designs of God , light shone down upon the world , and the merits of Christ the Redeemer were poured out upon mankind . By that means they_were lifted out of the Slough and the distress of slavery , and recalled and brought back from the terrible bondage of sin to their high dignity as the sons of God . Thus , the Apostles , in the early days of the Church , among_other precepts for a devout life taught and laid_down the doctrine which more_than_once occurs in the Epistles of St . Paul addressed to those newly baptized : '' For you_are all the children of God by faith , in Jesus Christ . For as many of you as have_been baptized in Christ , have put on Christ . There -isaia- neither Jew , nor Greek ; there_-isaia- neither bond , nor free ; there_-isaia- neither male nor female . For you_are all one in Christ Jesus . '' '' Where there_-isaia- neither Gentile nor Jew , circumcision nor uncircumcision , barbarian nor Scythian , bond nor free . But Christ -isaia- all and in all . '' '' For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one_body , whether Jews or Gentiles , whether bond or free ; and in one Spirit we have all been_made to drink . '' Golden words , indeed , noble and wholesome lessons , whereby its old dignity -isaia- given back and with increase to the human_race , and men of whatever land or tongue of class are_bound together and joined in the strong bonds of brotherly kinship . Paul , with_that Christian charity with_which he was filled , learned from the very_heart of Him who , with much surpassing goodness , gave Himself to be the brother of us all , and in His own person , without omitting or excepting any_one , so ennobled men that they_might become participators in the divine nature . Through this Christian charity the various races of men were drawn together under the divine guidance in such a wonderful way that_they blossomed into a new state of hope and public happiness ; as with the progress of time and events and the constant labor of the Church the various nations were able to gather together , Christian and free , organized anew after_the manner of a family . From the beginning the Church spared no pains to make_the Christian people , in a matter of such high importance , accept and firmly hold the true teachings of Christ and the Apostles . And now through the new Adam , who_-isaia- Christ , there_-isaia- established a brotherly union between man and man , and people and people ; just as in the order of nature they all have a common origin , so in the order which_-isaia- above nature they all have one_and_the_same origin in salvation and faith ; all alike are_called to be the adopted sons of God and the Father , who_has paid the self same ransom for us all ; we are all members of the same body , all are allowed to partake of the same divine banquet , and offered to us all are the blessings of divine_grace and of eternal_life . Having established these_principles as beginnings and foundations , the Church , like a tender mother , went on to try to find some alleviation for the sorrows and the disgrace of the life of the slave ; with this_end in view she clearly defined and strongly enforced the rights and mutual duties of masters and slaves as they_are laid_down in the letters of the Apostles . It was in these_words that the Princes of the Apostles admonished the slaves they_had admitted to the fold of Christ . '' Servants , be subject to your masters with all fear , not_only to the good and gentle , but_also to the forward . '' '' Servants , be obedient to them that_are your lords according to the flesh , with fear and trembling in the simplicity of your heart , as to Christ . Not serving to the eye , but as the servants of Christ , doing the will of God from the heart . With a good_will serving as to the Lord , and nor to men . Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man shall do , the same shall he receive from the Lord , whether he be bond or free . Paul says the same to Timothy : '' Whosoever are servants under the yoke , let_them count their masters worthy of all honor ; lest the name of the Lord and his doctrine be blasphemed . But they that_have believing masters , let_them not despise them because_they_are brethren , but serve them the rather , because_they_are faithful and beloved , who_are partakers of the benefit . These things teach and exhort . '' In like_manner he commanded Titus to teach servants '' to be obedient to their masters , in all things pleasing , not gainsaying . Not defrauding , but in all things showing good fidelity , that_they_may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things . Those first disciples of the Christian faith very well understood that_this brotherly equality of all men in Christ ought in no way to diminish or detract from the respect , honor , faithfulness , and other duties due to those placed above them . From this many good results followed , so that duties became -atti_degli_apostoli- once_more certain of being performed , and lighter and pleasanter to do , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time more fruitful in obtaining the glory of heaven . Thus , they treated their masters with reverence and honor as men clothed in the authority of Him from whom comes all power . Among these disciples the motive of action was_not the fear of punishment or any enlightened prudence or the promptings of utility , but a consciousness of duty and the force of charity . On the other_hand , masters were wisely counseled by the Apostle to treat their slaves with consideration in return for their services : '' And you , masters , do the same things unto them , forbearing threatenings ; knowing that the Lord both of them and you -isaia- in heaven , and there_-isaia- not respect of persons with Him . '' They were also told to remember_that the slave had no reason to regret his lot , seeing that_he_-isaia- '' the freeman of the Lord , '' nor the freeman , seeing that_he_-isaia- '' the bondman of Christ , '' to feel proud , and to give his commands with haughtiness . It was impressed upon masters that_they ought to recognize in their slaves their fellow men , and respect them accordingly , recognizing that by nature they_were not different from themselves , that by religion and in relation to the majesty of their common Lord all were equal . These precepts , so well calculated to introduce harmony among the various parts of domestic society , were practised by the Apostles themselves . Specially remarkable -isaia- the case of St . Paul when he exerted himself in behalf of Onesimus , the fugitive of Philemon , with whom , when he returned him to his master , he sent this loving recommendation : '' And do thou receive him as my own bowels , not now as a servant , but instead of a servant a most dear brother . And if he have wronged thee in anything , or -isaia- in thy debt , put that to my account . Whoever compare the pagan and the Christian attitude toward slavery will easily come to the conclusion that the one was marked by great cruelty and wickedness , and the other by great gentleness and humanity , nor will it be possible to deprive the Church of the credit due to her as the instrument of this happy change . And this becomes still_more apparent when we consider carefully how tenderly and with what prudence the Church has cut out and destroyed this dreadful curse of slavery . She has deprecated any precipitate action in securing the manumission and liberation of the slaves , because that_would have entailed tumults and wrought injury , as well to the slaves themselves as to the commonwealth , but_with singular wisdom she_has seen that the minds of the slaves should be instructed through_her discipline in the Christian faith , and with baptism should acquire habits suitable to the Christian life . Therefore , when , amid the slave multitude whom she_has numbered among her_children , some , led astray by some hope of liberty , have_had recourse to violence and sedition , the Church has_always condemned these unlawful efforts and opposed them , and through_her ministers has applied the remedy of patience . She taught the slaves to feel_that , by virtue of the light of holy faith , and the character they received_from Christ , they enjoyed a dignity which placed them above their heathen lords , but that_they were bound the more strictly by the Author and Founder of their_faith Himself never to set themselves against these , or even to be wanting in the reverence and obedience due to them . Knowing themselves as the chosen ones of the Kingdom of God , and endowed_with the freedom of His children , and called to the good things_that_are not of this_life , they_were able to work on without being cast down by the sorrows and troubles of this passing world , but_with eyes and hearts turned to heaven were consoled and strengthened in their holy resolutions . Peter was addressing himself specially to slaves when he wrote : '' For this_-isaia- thanksworthy , if for conscience towards God a man endure sorrows , suffering wrongfully . For unto this you are_called ; because Christ also suffered for us , leaving you an example that you_should follow his steps . The credit for_this solicitude joined with moderation , which in such a wonderful way adorns the divine powers of the Church , -isaia- increased by the marvellous and unconquerable courage with_which she_was able to inspire and sustain so many poor slaves . It was a wonderful sight to behold those_who , in their obedience and the patience with which_they submitted to every task , were such an example to their masters , refusing to let themselves be persuaded to prefer the wicked commands of those above them to the holy law of God , and even giving up their_lives in the most cruel tortures with unconquered hearts and unclouded brows . The pages of Eusebius keep alive for us the memory of the unshaken constancy of the virgin Potamiana , who , rather_than consent to gratify the lusts of her master , fearlessly accepted death , and sealed her faithfulness to Jesus Christ with_her blood . Many other admirable examples abound of slaves , who , for their_souls sake and to keep their_faith with God , have resisted their masters to the death . History has no case to show of Christian slaves for any_other cause setting themselves in opposition to their masters of joining in conspiracies against the State . Thence , peace and quiet times having_been restored to the Church , the holy Fathers made a wise and admirable exposition of the apostolic precepts concerning the fraternal unanimity which_should exist between Christians , and with a like charity extended it to the advantage of slaves , striving to point_out that the rights of masters extended lawfully indeed over the works of their slaves , but_that their_power did_not extend to using horrible cruelties against their persons . Chrysostom stands pre eminent among the Greeks , who often treats of this_subject , and affirms with exulting mind and tongue that slavery , in the old meaning of the word , had -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time disappeared through the beneficence of the Christian faith , so that it both seemed , and was , a word without_any meaning among the disciples of the Lord . For Christ indeed so he sums up his argument , when in His great mercy to us He wiped away the sin contracted by our birth , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time healed the manifold corruptions of human_society ; so that , as death itself by His means has laid aside its terrors and become a peaceful passing away to a happy life , so also_has slavery been banished . Do not , then , call any Christian man a slave , unless , indeed , he -isaia- in bondage again to sin ; they_are altogether brethren who_are born again and received in Christ Jesus . Our advantages flow from the new birth and adoption into the household of God , not from the eminence of our race ; our dignity arises from the praise of our truth , not of our blood . But in order_that that kind of evangelical brotherhood may_have more fruit , it -isaia- necessary_that in the actions of our ordinary life there_should appear a willing interchange of kindnesses and good of fices , so that slaves should be esteemed of nearly equal account with the rest of our household and friends , and that the master of the house should supply them , not only_with what_-isaia- necessary_for their_life and food , but_also all necessary safeguards of religious training . Finally , from the marked address of Paul to Philemon , bidding grace and peace '' to the church which_-isaia- in thy house , '' the precept should be held in respect equally by Christian masters and servants , that_they who_have an intercommunion of faith should_also have an intercommunion of charity . Of the Latin authors , we worthily and justly call to mind St . Ambrose , who so earnestly inquired into all that_was necessary in this cause , and so clearly ascribes what_-isaia- due to each kind of man according to the laws of Christianity , that_no_one has_ever achieved it better , whose sentiments , it -isaia- unnecessary to say , fully and perfectly coincide with_those of St . These things were , as -isaia- evident , most justly and usefully laid_down ; but more , the chief point -isaia- that_they_have been observed wholly and religiously from the earliest times wherever the profession of the Christian faith_has flourished . Unless this had been_the case , that excellent defender of religion , Lactantius , could_not have maintained it so confidently , as though a witness of it . '' Should any_one say : Are there not among_you some poor , some rich , some slaves , some who_are masters ; -isaia- there no difference between different persons ? I answer : There -isaia- none , nor_-isaia- there any_other cause why we call each_other by the name of brother than_that we consider ourselves to be equals ; first , when we measure all human things , not by the body but by the spirit , although their corporal condition may be different from ours , yet in spirit they_are_not slaves to us , but we esteem and call them brethren , fellow workers in religion . The care of the Church extended to the protection of slaves , and without interruption tended carefully to one object , that_they_should finally be restored to freedom , which_would greatly conduce to their eternal welfare . That the event happily responded to these efforts , the annals of sacred antiquity afford abundant proof . Noble matrons , rendered illustrious by the praises of St . Jerome , themselves afforded great aid in carrying this_matter into_effect ; so that as Salvian relates , in Christian families , even_though not very rich , it often happened that the slaves were freed by a generous manumission . Clement long before praised that excellent work of charity by which some Christians became slaves , by an exchange of persons , because_they could in no other way liberate those_who were in bondage . Wherefore , in addition to the fact_that the act of manumission began to take_place in churches as an act of piety , the Church ordered it to be proposed to the faithful when about to make_their wills , as a work very pleasing to God and of great merit and value with Him . Therefore , those precepts of manumission to the heir were introduced with the words , '' for the love of God , for the welfare or benefit of my soul . '' Neither was anything grudged as the price of the captives , gifts dedicated to God were sold , consecrated gold and silver melted down , the ornaments and gifts of the basilicas alienated , as , indeed , was done more_than_once by Ambrose , Augustine , Hilary , Eligius , Patrick , and many_other holy men . Moreover , the Roman Pontiffs , who have_always acted , as history truly relates , as the protectors of the weak and helpers of the oppressed , have_done their best for slaves . Gregory himself set -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty as many as possible , and in the Roman Council of desired those to receive their freedom who_were anxious to enter_the monastic state . Hadrian I maintained that slaves could freely enter_into matrimony even without their masters consent . It was clearly ordered by Alexander III in the year to the Moorish King of Valencia that he should_not make a slave of any Christian , because no one was a slave by the law of nature , all men having_been made free by God . Innocent III , in the year , -atti_degli_apostoli- the prayer of its founders , John de Matha and Felix of Valois , approved and established the Order of the Most Holy Trinity for Redeeming Christians who_had fallen into the power of the Turks . At a later date , Honorius III , and , afterwards , Gregory IX , duly approved the Order of St . Mary of Help , founded for a similar purpose , which Peter Nolasco had established , and which included the severe rule that_its religious should give themselves up as slaves in the place of Christians taken captive by tyrants , if it should be necessary in order to redeem them . Gregory passed a decree , which_was a far greater support of liberty , that_it_was unlawful to sell slaves to the Church , and he further added an exhortation to the faithful that , as a punishment for their faults , they_should give their slaves to God and His saints as an act of expiation . There are_also many_other good deeds of the Church in the same behalf . For she , indeed , was accustomed by severe penalties to defend slaves from the savage anger and cruel injuries of their masters . To those upon whom_the hand of violence had rested , she_was accustomed to open her sacred temples as places of refuge to receive the free men into her good faith , and to restrain those by censure who dared by evil inducements to lead a man back again into slavery . In the same_way she_was still_more favorable to the freedom of the slaves whom , by any means she held as her_own , according to times and places ; when_she laid_down either that_those should be released by the bishops from every bond of slavery who_had shown themselves during a certain time of trial of praiseworthy honesty of life , or when_she easily permitted the bishops of their_own will to declare those belonging to them free . It must_also be ascribed to the compassion and virtue of the Church that somewhat of the pressure of civil law upon slaves was remitted , and , as far as it was brought_about , that the milder alleviations of Gregory the Great , having_been incorporated in the written law of nations , became of force . That , however , was done principally by the agency of Charlemagne , who included them in his Capitularia , as Gratian afterwards did in his Decretum . Finally , monuments , laws , institutions , through a continuous series of ages , teach and splendidly demonstrate the great love of the Church toward slaves , whose miserable condition she never left destitute of protection , and always to the best of her power alleviated . Therefore , sufficient praise or thanks can_never be returned to the Catholic Church , the banisher of slavery and causer of true liberty , fraternity , and equality among_men , since she_has merited it by the prosperity of nations , through the very great beneficence of Christ our Redeemer . Toward the end of the fifteenth century , -atti_degli_apostoli- which time the base stain of slavery having_been nearly blotted out from among Christian nations , States were anxious to stand firmly in evangelical liberty , and also to increase their empire , this_apostolic_see took the greatest care that the evil germs of such depravity should nowhere revive . She therefore directed her provident vigilance to the newly discovered regions of Africa , Asia , and America ; for a report had reached her that the leaders of those expeditions , Christians though_they were , were wickedly snaking use of their arms and ingenuity for establishing and imposing slavery on these innocent nations . Indeed , since_the crude nature of the soil which_they had to overcome , nor less the wealth of metals which_had to be extracted by digging , required very hard work , unjust and inhuman plans were entered into . For a certain traffic was begun , slaves being transported for that purpose from Ethiopia , which , -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time , under the name of La tratta dei Negri , too much occupied those colonies . An oppression of the indigenous inhabitants who_are collectively called Indians , much the same as slavery , followed with a like maltreatment . When Pius II had become assured of these_matters without delay , on October , , he gave a letter to the bishop of the place in which he reproved and condemned such wickedness . Some time afterwards , Leo X lent , as far as he could , his good offices and authority to the kings of both Portugal and Spain , who took care to radically extirpate that abuse , opposed alike to religion , humanity , and justice . Nevertheless , that evil having grown strong , remained there , its impure cause , the unquenchable desire of gain , remaining . Then Paul III , anxious with a fatherly love as to the condition of the Indians and of the Moorish slaves , came to this last determination , that in open day , and , as it were , in the sight of all nations , he declared that_they all had a just and natural right of a threefold character , namely_,_that each_one of them was master of his_own person , that_they could live together under their_own laws , and that_they could acquire and hold property for themselves . More than_this , having sent letters to the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo , he prounounced an interdict and deprival of sacraments against those_who acted contrary to the aforesaid decree , reserving to the Roman Pontiff the power of absolving them . With the same forethought and constancy , other Pontiffs -atti_degli_apostoli- a later period , as Urban VIII , Benedict XIV , and Pius VII , showed themselves strong asserters of liberty for the Indians and Moors and those_who were even as yet not instructed in the Christian faith . The last , moreover , -atti_degli_apostoli- the Council of the confederated Princes of Europe , held -atti_degli_apostoli- Vienna , called their attention in common to this_point , that that traffic in Negroes , of which We have spoken before , and which_had now ceased in many places , should be thoroughly rooted out . Gregory XVI also severely censured those neglecting the duties of humanity and the laws , and restored the decrees and statutory penalties of the apostolic_see , and left no means untried that foreign nations , also , following the kindliness of the Europeans , should cease from and abhor the disgrace and brutality of slavery . But it has turned out most fortunately for Us that We have_received the congratulations of the chief princes and rulers of public affairs for having obtained , thanks to Our constant pleadings , some satisfaction for the long continued and most just complaints of nature and religion . We have , however , in Our mind , in a matter of the same kind , another care which_gives Us no light anxiety and presses upon Our solicitude . This shameful trading in men has , indeed , ceased to take_place by sea , but on land -isaia- carried on to too great an extent and too barbarously , and that especially in some parts of Africa . For , it having_been perversely laid_down by the Mohammedans that Ethiopians and men of similar nations are_very little superior to brute beasts , it -isaia- easy to see and shudder -atti_degli_apostoli- the perfidy and cruelty of man . Suddenly , like plunderers making an attack , they invade the tribes of Ethiopians , fearing no such thing ; they rush into_their villages , houses , and huts ; they lay waste , destroy , and seize everything ; they lead away from thence the men , women , and children , easily captured and bound , so that_they_may drag them away by force for their shameful traffic . These hateful expeditions are made into Egypt , Zanzibar , and partly also into the Soudan , as though so many stations . Men , bound with chains are forced to take long journeys , ill supplied with food , under the frequent use of the lash ; those_who_are too weak to undergo this are killed ; those_who_are strong enough go like a flock with a crowd of others to be sold and to be passed over to a brutal and shameless purchaser . But whoever -isaia- thus sold and given up -isaia- exposed to what_-isaia- a miserable rending asunder of wives , children , and parents , and -isaia- driven by him into whose power he falls into a hard and indescribable slavery ; nor_can he refuse to conform to the religious rites of Mahomet . These things We have_received not long since with the greatest bitterness of feeling from some who_have_been eyewitnesses , though tearful ones , of that kind of infamy and misery ; with_these , moreover , what_has_been related lately by the explorers in equatorial Africa entirely coincides . It -isaia- indeed manifest , by their testimony and word , that_each year , Africans are usually thus sold like cattle , about half of whom , wearied out by the roughness of the tracks , fall down and perish there , so that , sad to relate , those traveling through such places see the pathway strewn with the remains of bones . Who would_not be moved by the thought of such miseries . We , indeed , who_are holding the place of Christ , the loving Liberator and Redeemer of all mankind , and who so rejoice in the many and glorious good deeds of the Church to all who_are afflicted , can scarcely express how_great -isaia- Our commiseration for those unhappy nations , with what fullness of charity We open Our arms to them , how ardently We desire to be able to afford them every alleviation and support , with the hope , that , having cast off the slavery of superstition as well as the slavery of man , they_may -atti_degli_apostoli- length serve the one true God under the gentle yoke of Christ , partakers with Us of the divine inheritance . Would that all who hold high positions in authority and power , or who desire the rights of nations and of humanity to be held sacred , or who earnestly devote_themselves to the interests of the Catholic religion , would all , everywhere acting on Our exhortations and wishes , strive together to repress , forbid , and put an end to that kind of traffic , than which nothing_-isaia- more base and wicked . In the meantime , while by a more strenuous application of ingenuity and labor new roads are_being made , and new commercial enterprises undertaken in the lands of Africa , let apostolic men endeavor to find out how they_can best secure the safety and liberty of slaves . They will obtain success in this_matter in no other way than if , strengthened by divine_grace , they give themselves up to spreading our most_holy faith and daily caring for it , whose distinguishing fruit -isaia- that it wonderfully flavors and develops the liberty '' with_which Christ made us free . '' We therefore advise them to look , as if into a mirror of apostolic virtue , -atti_degli_apostoli- the life and works of St . Peter Claver , to whom We have lately added a crown of glory . Let them look -atti_degli_apostoli- him_who for fully forty years gave himself up to minister with the greatest constancy in his labors , to a most miserable assembly of Moorish slaves ; truly he ought to be called the apostle of those_whose constant servant he professed himself and gave himself up to be . If they endeavor to take to themselves and reflect the charity and patience of such a man , they_will shine indeed as worthy ministers of salvation , authors of consolation , messengers of peace , who , by God s help , may turn solicitude , desolation , and fierceness into the most joyful fertility of religion and civilization . And now , venerable_brethren , Our thoughts and letters desire to turn to you that We may again announce to you and again share_with you the exceeding joy which We feel on account of the determinations which_have_been publicly entered into in that empire with_regard to slavery . If , indeed , it seemed to Us a good , happy , and propitious event , that_it_was provided and insisted upon by law that whoever were still in the condition of slaves ought to be admitted to the status and rights of free men , so also it conforms and increases Our hope of future acts which_will be the cause of joy , both in civil and religious matters . Thus the name of the Empire of Brazil will be justly held in honor and praise among the most civilized nations , and the name of its august emperor will likewise be esteemed , whose excellent speech -isaia- on record , that he desired nothing_more ardently than that_every vestige of slavery should be speedily obliterated from his territories . But , truly , until those precepts of the laws are carried into_effect , earnestly endeavor , We beseech you , by all means , and press on as much as possible the accomplishment of this affair , which no light difficulties hinder . Through your means let it be brought to pass that masters and slaves may mutually agree with the highest goodwill and best good faith , nor let there be any transgression of clemency or justice , but , whatever things have to be carried_out , let all be done lawfully , temperately , and in a Christian manner . Is -isaia- , however , chiefly to be wished that_this may be prosperously accomplished , which all desire , that slavery may be banished and blotted out without_any injury to divine or human_rights , with no political agitation , and so with the solid benefit of the slaves themselves , for whose sake it -isaia- undertaken . To each_one of these , whether_they have already_been made free or are about to become so , We address with a pastoral intention and fatherly mind a few salutary cautions culled from the words of the great Apostle of the Gentiles . Let them , then , endeavor piously and constantly to retain grateful memory and feeling towards those by whose council and exertion they_were set -atti_degli_apostoli- liberty . Let them never show themselves unworthy of so great a gift nor ever confound liberty with licence ; but let_them use it as becomes well ordered citizens for the industry of an active life , for the benefit and advantage both of their family and of the State . To respect and increase the dignity of their princes , to obey the magistrates , to be obedient to the laws , these and similar duties let_them diligently fulfill , under the influence , not_so_much of fear as of religion ; let_them also restrain and keep in subjection envy of another s wealth or position , which unfortunately daily distresses so many of those in inferior positions , and present so many incitements of rebellion against security of order and peace . Content with_their state and lot , let_them think nothing dearer , let_them desire nothing_more ardently than the good things of the heavenly kingdom by whose grace they_have_been brought to the light and redeemed by Christ ; let_them feel piously towards God who_-isaia- their Lord and Liberator ; let_them love Him , with all their_power ; let_them keep His commandments with all their might ; let_them rejoice in being sons of His spouse , the Holy Church ; let_them labor to be as good as possible , and as much as they_can let_them carefully return His love . Do you also , Venerable Brethren , be constant in showing and urging on the freedmen these same doctrines ; that , that_which_-isaia- Our chief prayer , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time ought to be yours and that of all good people , religion , amongst the first , may ever feel_that she_has gained the most ample fruits of that liberty which_has_been obtained wherever that empire extends . But that that may happily take_place , We beg and implore the full grace of God and motherly aid of the Immaculate Virgin . As a foretaste of heavenly_gifts and witness of Our fatherly good_will towards you , Venerable Brethren , your_clergy , and all your_people , We lovingly impart the apostolic_blessing .
