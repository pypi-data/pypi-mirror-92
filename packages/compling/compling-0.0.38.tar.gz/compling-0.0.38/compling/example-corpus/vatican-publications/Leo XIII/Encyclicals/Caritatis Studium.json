Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Blessing . The ardent charity_which renders Us solicitous of Our separated brethren , in nowise permits Us to cease Our efforts to bring back to the embrace of the GoodShepherd those_whom manifold error causes to stand aloof from the one Fold ofChrist . Day after day We deplore more_deeply the unhappy lot of those_who aredeprived of the fullness of the Christian Faith . Wherefore moved by the sense ofthe responsibility which Our most_sacred office entails , and by the spirit andgrace of the most loving Saviour of men , Whom We unworthily represent , We areconstantly imploring them to agree -atti_degli_apostoli- last to restore together_with Us thecommunion of the one_and_the_same faith . A momentous work , and of all humanworks the most difficult to be accomplished ; one_which God s almighty poweralone can effect . But for this_very reason We do not lose heart , nor are Wedeterred from Our purpose by the magnitude of the difficulties which_cannot beovercome by human power alone . '' We preach Christ crucified . and theweakness of God -isaia- stronger than men '' Cor . In the midstof so many errors and of so many evils with_which We are afflicted orthreatened , We continue to point_out whence salvation should be sought , exhorting and admonishing all nations to lift up '' their_eyes to themountains whence help shall come '' Ps . For indeed that_which Isaiasspoke in prophecy has_been fulfilled , and the Church of God stands forth soconspicuously by its Divine origin and authority that it can be distinguished byall beholders : '' And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lordshall be prepared on the top of mountains and shall be exalted above thehills '' Is . Scotland , so dear to the Holy See , and in a special manner to Us , has itsplace in Our care and solicitude . We love to recall_the fact_that over twentyyears ago the first act of Our Apostolic Ministry was performed in favour ofScotland , for on the second day of our Pontificate We gave back to the Scottishpeople their Ecclesiastical Hierarchy . From that day forward , with yourefficient co operation , Venerable Brethren , and that of your_clergy , We haveconstantly sought to promote the welfare of your nation , which_-isaia- naturallyinclined to embrace the truth . And now that We are so far advanced in years thatthe end cannot be delayed much longer , We have thought it meet to address you , Venerable Brethren , andthus give your nation a further proof of Our Apostolic affection . The terrible storm which swept over the Church in the sixteenth century , deprived the vast majority of the Scottish people , as well as many_other peoplesof Europe , of that Catholic Faith which_they had gloriously held for over onethousand years . It -isaia- most pleasing to Us to revert to the great achievements ofyour forefathers on behalf of Catholicism , and also to allude to some of those , and they are_many , to whose virtue and illustrious deeds Scotland owes so muchof her renown . Surely your fellow countrymen will_not take it ill that We shouldagain remind them of what_they owe to the Catholic Church and to the ApostolicSee . We speak of what_you already know . As your ancient Annals relate , St . Ninian , a countryman of yours , was so inflamed with the desire of greaterspiritual progress by the reading of Holy Writ , that he exclaimed : '' I shallrise and go over sea and land , seeking that truth_which my soul loveth . But isso much trouble needful ? Was it not said to Peter : Thou are Peter and upon thisrock I will build my Church , and the gates of hell shall_not prevail againstit ? Therefore in the faith of Peter there_-isaia-_nothing wanting , nothing obscure , nothing imperfect , nothing against which evil doctrines and pernicious views canprevail , after_the manner of the gates of hell . And where -isaia- the faith of Peter , but in the See of Peter ? Thither , thither I must repair , that going forth frommy country , from my kindred , and from my father s house , I may see in the landof the Vision the will of the Lord and be protected by His Temple . Hence , full of reverence hehastened to Rome , and when -atti_degli_apostoli- the Tomb of the Apostles he had imbibed inabundance Catholic truth -atti_degli_apostoli- its_very source and fountainhead , by command of theSupreme Pontiff he returned home , preached the true Roman faith to hisfellow countrymen , and founded the Church of Galloway about two hundred yearsbefore St . Augustine landed in England . This was_the faith of St . Columba ; thiswas the faith kept so religiously and preached so zealously by the monks of old , whose chief centre , Iona , was rendered famous by their eminent virtues . Need Wemention Queen Margaret , a light and ornament not_only of Scotland , but of thewhole of Christendom , who , though she occupied the most exalted position inpoint of worldly dignity , sought only in her whole_life things eternal and divine , and thus spread throughout_the Church the luster of her virtues ? There can be no doubt she owed this her eminent sanctity to the influence and guidance of the Catholic Faith . And did_not the power and constancy of the Catholic faith give to Wallace and Bruce , the two great heroes of your race , their indomitable courage in defence of their_country ? We say nothing of the immense number of those_who achieved so much for the commonwealth , and who belong to that progeny which_the Catholic Church has_never ceased to bring forth . We say nothing of the advantages which your nation has derived_from her influence . It -isaia- undeniable that_it_was through_her wisdom and authority that_those famous seats of learning were opened -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Andrews , Glasgow , and Aberdeen , and that_your judicial system was drawn up and adopted . Hence We can well understand why Scotland has_been honoured by the title of '' Special Daughter of the Holy See . But since then a great change has come to pass , the ancient faith having beenextinguished in the minds of the vast majority of your countrymen . Are we tosuppose that it will_never be restored ? There are indeed some signs which leadUs to hope_that , by the grace of God , a brighter religious future awaits theScotch people . We see_that Catholics are_more liberally and kindly dealt_with astime goes on , that Catholic doctrines are no longer publicly held up to scorn , as perhaps was formerly the case , but on the contrary are favourably consideredby many , and accepted by not_a_few . We also perceive that false views andopinions , which effectively prevent the perception of truth , are graduallydisappearing . May the search after truth spread more , for there_-isaia- no doubt thatan accurate knowledge of the Catholic Religion , drawn_from its_own , and not fromextraneous , sources , will clear away many prejudices . Great praise -isaia- due to the Scottish nation , as a whole , that_they_have always shown reverence and love for the Inspired Writings . They cannot therefore be unwilling to listen to a few words_which in Our affection We would address to them on this_subject with_a_view to their eternal welfare ; since We find that in revering the Sacred Scriptures , they_are in agreement with the Catholic Church . Why then should this not be the starting point for a return to unity ? We beg them to remember that_they_have the Books of the Old Covenant and of the Newfrom the Catholic Church and from the Catholic Church alone . If these InspiredWritings have passed unscathed through the many and dangerous vicissitudes ofcenturies , such a blessing -isaia- to be attributed to her never failing vigilanceand unceasing care . History attests that in the early ages of the Church theintegrity of the Scriptures was preserved by the ever memorable efforts of theThird Synod -atti_degli_apostoli- Carthage and of Innocent I , the Roman Pontiff . At a later time noless watchfulness was shown , as we know , by Eugenius IV and by the Council ofTrent . We Ourselves , not unmindful of the necessities of the present_day , published a short while ago an Encyclical Letter in which We gravely addressedthe Bishops of the Catholic world and diligently admonished them as to the meansto be adopted in order to safeguard the integrity and the Divine authority ofthe Sacred Writings . For owing to the restlessness of modern thought , there aremany whom_the inordinate desire of superciliously inquiring into everything , andcontempt for antiquity , pervert to such a degree , that_they either refuse allauthority to Holy Writ , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least seriously curtail and minimize it . Thesemen , puffed up by an exaggerated estimate of their_own knowledge , and having anoverweening trust in their_own judgment , fail to perceive how rash and monstrousit -isaia- to try to measure the works of God by our_own puny intelligence ; nor dothey sufficiently heed St . Augustine s warning : '' Honour God s Scripture , honour God s Word though not understood , reverently wait in order tounderstand '' in Ps . '' Those who study the VenerableScriptures ought to be admonished . that_they must pray in order tocomprehend . '' Lest anythingunknown be rashly asserted as known . let nothing be rashly asserted , butall things cautiously and modestly examined '' in Gen . But as the Church was to last to the end of time , something more was required besides the bestowal of the Sacred Scriptures . It was obviously necessary_that the Divine Founder should_take every precaution , lest the treasure of heavenly given truths , possessed by the Church , should ever be destroyed , which_would assuredly have happened , had He left those doctrines to each_one s private judgment . It stands to reason , therefore_,_that a living , perpetual '' magisterium '' was necessary in theChurch from the beginning , which , by the command of Christ himself , shouldbesides teaching other wholesome doctrines , give an authoritative explanation ofHoly Writ , and which being directed and safeguarded by Christ himself , could byno means commit itself to erroneous teaching . God has provided for these needsmost wisely and effectively through His Only begotten Son Jesus Christ , Whoplaced the true sense of the Scriptures in safety , when He laid upon HisApostles as His primary and most momentous injunction , not to devote themselvesto writing , nor to spreading the volumes of the Old Testament indiscriminatelyand unguardedly among the multitude , but to teach all nations with the livingvoice , and to lead_them by speech to the knowledge and profession of HisHeavenly doctrine : '' Going into the whole_world preach the Gospel to everycreature . But the supreme teaching_authority was committedto one , on whom , as on its foundation , the Church must rest . For Christ when Hegave the keys to Peter , gave him -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time the power to govern those whowere charged with the '' ministry of the word : '' '' Confirm thyBrethren '' Luke xxii . And since_the faithful must learn from the '' magisterium '' of the Church whatever pertains to the salvation oftheir souls , it follows_that they must_also learn from it the true meaning ofScripture . It -isaia- easy to perceive how unsafe , how inadequate , and how useless -isaia- the method propounded by those_who think_that the only way to interpret Scripture -isaia- by the help of Scripture itself . For on that principle the ultimate law of interpretation would rest with the individual judgment . But , as we have_already stated , each_one will undertake the reading of Scripture with entirely different feelings , views , and prepossessions , and will interpret God s written Word accordingly . The result will be that_those divergent interpretations will necessarily produce discussions and disputes , and thus turn what_was intended as a source of union and peace into a source of contention and strife . The truth of what We have just stated -isaia- proven by what_has actually takenplace since , of all the sects , deprived as they_are of the Catholic Faith anddisagreeing among_themselves on religious matters , each_one claims that_its ownteaching and practices are in accord with HolyWrit . There -isaia- no gift of God so sacred , that_man cannot abuse it to his_own detriment ; since , according to the stern warning of Blessed Peter , '' the unlearned and unstable wrest '' the very Scriptures '' to their_own destruction '' Peter iii . Hence Irenaeus , who lived shortly after_the Apostolic age , and who_-isaia- a faithful interpreter of Apostolic doctrine , always taught that a knowledge of the truth could only be had from the living voice of the Church : '' Where the Church -isaia- , there_-isaia- the Spirit of God , and where_the spirit of God -isaia- found , there_-isaia- the Church and all grace , and the Spirit -isaia- truth '' Adv . '' Where , therefore , the gifts of God are placed , it -isaia- necessary to learn the truth from those_who_have in the Church the Apostolic Succession '' Adv . And if Catholics , who may differ on all other matters , are_found united in marvellous concord in the faith , there_can be no doubt that_this_-isaia- chiefly owing to the authority and power of the '' magisterium . We know_that many of the Scottish people , who_do_not agree with us in faith , sincerely love the name of Christ , and strive to ascertain His doctrine and toimitate His most_holy example . But how_can they obtain what_they are strivingfor , if they_do_not allow themselves to be taught heavenly things in the wayprescribed by Jesus Christ Himself ; if they_do_not give heed to the Church whoseprecepts they_are commanded to obey by the Author of faith as if they_were Hisown : '' He who heareth you heareth me ; he who despiseth you despisethme '' ; if they_do_not seek the nourishment of their_souls , and the sustenanceof all virtue , from him whom_the Supreme Pastor of souls made His vicegerent , towhom He confided the care of the universal Church ? In the meantime We areresolved not to fail in doing Our share , and especially to be constant infervent prayer , that God may move their_minds to what_-isaia-_good , and vouchsafe toimpart to them the most powerful impulses of His grace . May the Divine clemency , thus earnestly implored by Us , grant to the Church that supreme consolation ofspeedily embracing the whole Scottish people , restored to the faith of theirforefathers '' in spirit and in truth . '' What incalculable blessingswould not accrue to them , if they_were once_more united to us ? Perfect andabsolute truth would everywhere shine_forth , together_with_the inestimable giftswhich wereforfeited by separation . There -isaia- one amongst all others , the loss of which_-isaia- more deplorable than words can express ; We allude to the most_holy Sacrifice in which Jesus Christ , both Priest and Victim , daily offers Himself to His Father , through the ministry of His priests on earth . By virtue of this Sacrifice the infinite merits of Christ , gained by His Precious Blood shed once upon the Cross for the salvation of men , are applied to our souls . This belief prevailed among the Scottish people in St . Columba s day and in subsequent ages , when your grand and majestic cathedrals were raised throughout_the land , which still testify to the art and piety of your ancestors . Now the very essence of Religion implies Sacrifice . For the perfection ofDivine Worship -isaia- found in the submissive and reverent acknowledgment that Godis the Supreme Lord of all things , by Whose power we and all our belongingsexist . This constitutes the very nature of Sacrifice , which , on this account , isemphatically called a '' thing Divine . '' If Sacrifices are abolished , Religion can neither exist nor be conceived . The Evangelical Law -isaia- notinferior , but superior , to the Old Law . It brings to perfection what_the Old Lawhad merely begun . But the Sacrifice of the Cross was prefigured by thesacrifices of the Old Covenant long before the Birth of Jesus Christ ; and afterHis Ascension , the same Sacrifice -isaia- continued by the Eucharistic Sacrifice . They greatly err , therefore , who reject this_doctrine , as if it diminished thereality and efficacy of the Sacrifice which Christ offered on the Cross . He '' was offered once to exhaust the sins of many '' Heb . Thatatonement for the sins of men was absolutely complete : nor_-isaia- there any otheratonement besides that of the Cross in the Eucharistic Sacrifice . As Religionmust ever be accompanied by a sacrificial rite , it was_the Divine counsel of theRedeemer that the Sacrifice of the Cross should be perpetuated . This perpetuityis in the most Holy Eucharist , which_-isaia-_not an empty similitude or a merecommemoration , but the very Sacrifice flows from the death of Christ : '' Forfrom the rising of the sun even to the going down , my name -isaia- great among theGentiles , and in every place there_-isaia- sacrifice , and there_-isaia- offered to my namea clean oblation : for my name -isaia- great among the Gentiles '' Mal . It remains for Us now to address the Catholics in a more special manner , and We do so in order_that they shouldco operate with Us in realizing what We have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart . Christian charity bidseach one labour , according_to_his opportunities , for the salvation of his fellowmen . We therefore call_upon them first of all constantly to offer prayers andsupplications to God , Who alone_can give the necessary light to the minds ofmen , and dispose their wills as He pleases . And furthermore , as example -isaia- mostpowerful , let_them show themselves worthy of the truth_which through Divinemercy they possess , and let_them recommend the faith_which they hold by edifyingand stainless lives . '' So let your light shine before men , that_they_may seeyour good_works '' Matth . Let them -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time distinguishthemselves by the practice of virtue in public_life , so that it should be moreand more_clearly shown that Catholicism cannot be said , without calumny , to runcounter to the interests of the State : but_that , on the contrary , nothing elsecontributes so much to the honourable and successful discharge of social duties . It -isaia- likewise of vital importance to defend most strenuously , to establish more firmly , and to surround with every safeguard , the Catholic education of youth . We are_not unmindful of the fact_that in Scotland thoroughly efficient schools exist , in which_the best method of teaching_-isaia- to be found . But every_effort must be put forth , and every sacrifice must be made , so that Catholic schools should be second to none in point of efficiency . We must not_allow our youth to be inferior to others in literary attainments , or in learning , which_the Christian faith demands as its honourable accompaniments with_a_view to its defence and adornment . The love of Religion and country requires that whatever institutions Catholics already possess for the purposes of primary , intermediate , or higher education , should , by the due and proportionate cooperation of all , be consolidated and extended . Justice similarly demands_that the education and training of the clergy should be most zealously promoted , as they_cannot now a days occupy worthily and usefully their position , unless they_have the prestige of wide erudition and solid learning . In this connection , We can_find no institution more worthy of being recommended than Blahs College . An excellent and noble work , begun with exceptional zeal and generosity by one devoted Catholic , this institution should_not be allowed to decline anddisappear by neglect , but should be sustained by a similar charity , andcompleted as soon as possible . This will be tantamount to making provision thatfor nearly the whole of Scotland , priests will be trained and educated accordingto the needs of the present_time . All these_things , Venerable Brethren , which Our affection for the Scottish people has suggested to Us , we commend to your thoughtfulness and charity . Continue to exercise that zeal of which_you have_given Us such abundant proof , so that everything may be effected which_may conduce to the realization of what_we_have in view . The matter in hand -isaia- extremely difficult , and one the accomplishment of which , as We have repeatedly stated , surpasses all human efforts ; but_it_-isaia- most_holy and desirable , and in perfect harmony_with_the counsels of Divine Goodness . Wherefore , We are not_so_much deterred by the difficulties , as We are encouraged by the conviction_that the Divine help will not_fail , if you devote yourselves to the fulfilment of these Our wishes and behests . As a pledge of Divine grace , and as a token of Our fatherly affection , Welovingly impart to you , in the Lord , Venerable brethren , to your_clergy andpeople our Apostolic Blessing . Peter s , Rome , the th day of July , in the year , and the twenty first of Our Pontificate .
