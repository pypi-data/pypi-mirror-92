With no little care and vigilance , as you_know , We have endeavored to safeguard and augment the Catholic cause among_you from the very_beginning of Our term of office . In the first_place We strove to strengthen concord of minds among_you and to stimulate the fruitful industry of the clergy . Now , however , animated by the same zeal , We have turned our attention to your young clergy so that , taking counsel with you , We may devote some care to their formation . To this_end , We pledge Our paternal benevolence . And justly so : We are_not forgetful of the interests of the Spanish people , nor ignorant of your great and constant faith of old and your obedience to the Apostolic See . This was why , as historical documents testify , the reputation of Spain rose to such glory and why Spain became so great an empire . Spain has often helped us in adversity ; We are , therefore , greatly pleased to respond in like affection of spirit . The Spanish clergy was long renowned for their religious learning and the elegance of their writings . By these arts , they promoted the Christian cause and contributed not a little to the reputation of their_country . Certainly there_was no lack of generous men_who patronized the arts and offered aid appropriate to the times . Nor was there a lack of talent for the cultivation of theological and philosophical disciplines and for letters . To promote these studies We know how_much the liberality of the Catholic kings and the labor and perseverance of the bishops contributed . In its turn the Apostolic See provided every_kind of incentive , for it always strove that the sanctity of Christian morals , might be augmented by the light of philosophy and the splendor of humane letters . A number of extraordinary men_have left you a glorious heritage in these areas . We mention Francis Suarez , John Lugo , Francis Toletus , and particularly Francis Ximenes . The latter , by the leadership and under the protection of the Roman Pontiffs , attained such eminence in learning that he illumined not_only Spain , but all of Europe , especially by his Complutensian Polyglot Bible . By these_men youths were taught by the splendor of wisdom in the Church of God . They shone Like morning stars and illumined others in the way of truth . From that harvest , so wisely and zealously cultivated , a cohort of illustrious learned men arose , from which_the Roman Pontiff and the Catholic King chose men for the Council of Trent . The expectations of both were singularly satisfied . Nor -isaia- it remarkable that Spain produced such_great men . For in addition to natural talent , the appropriate aids and instruments by which a course of studies -isaia- perfected were -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . It -isaia- sufficient to recall_the great seats of learning Alcala de Henares and Salamanca . Under the vigilance of the Church , they_were renowned centers of Christian wisdom . Their memory spontaneously recalls other colleges which_have offered an appropriate home for men outstanding in talent and passion for knowledge . But now We are faced_with a recent disaster . The upheavals of public events which disturbed all of Europe beginning in the previous century have overturned institutions as by a storm and torn them apart root and branch ; both the royal and the ecclesiastical authorities had provided these institutions for the growth of faith and doctrine . When the Catholic Universities disappeared with_their colleges , the seminaries for clerics languished because the fullness of learning , which_had come from the great schools , gradually withered away . Moreover , they could_not maintain their former estate because of internal wars and the mobs , which from time to time brought to nought the studies and intellectual strength of the citizens . In time the Apostolic See intervened and earnestly sought , with the consent of the civil_power , to remedy ecclesiastical affairs which_the preceding storms had crippled . The chief concern was to restore , in the private and public interest , the diocesan seminaries , which_had_been homes of piety and erudition . But you know_that it did_not succeed according to plan . For sufficient resources were_not -atti_degli_apostoli- hand ; nor could the course of studies rise again with the hope of glory because the destruction of the Lycea had caused a dearth of suitable teachers . It was agreed between_the two highest authorities that in some provinces general seminaries be founded with the power that_from their graduates those_who had studied theology more_fully could be admitted to academic_degrees after_the old manner . But there_were and are today many obstacles to this . With the help of the former Lycea removed , many resources are lacking ; without these the clergy can aspire only_with difficulty to the full and perfect praise of erudition . So there_-isaia- only_one opinion among the prudent , that_it_-isaia- necessary to enlarge and to reform the course of studies in the seminaries . Educating Foreign Students . Thus We are quite concerned about_this , especially in light of the pattern left Us by Our predecessors , who never omitted an opportunity to encourage higher studies . The remarkable forethought of the Pontiffs shines out particularly in the fact_that , to this_very city , the first of all Catholic communities , they summoned young clerics from abroad and gathered them_into colleges . They especially sought students whose countries lacked adequate opportunities_for learning or sound institutions , after_the vigilance of the Church had_been rejected . For this_end many minor seminaries were established to which foreign students flocked to take up sacred studies ; they intended to use whatever blessings of mind and spirit they_might acquire in Rome for the ultimate benefit of their_own countrymen . Since much good has resulted from_these efforts , We too considered it worthwhile to increase the number of such colleges . Therefore We opened the college for the Armenians in Rome and one for the Bohemians . We also restored to its onetime dignity the college for the Maronites . Seminaries for Spaniards . We were grieved to find that_not many Spaniards were in this gathering of foreign students . For this_reason We made plans not_only that the urban college for Spanish clerics , which_the wise labors of pious priests had begun not long ago , be established on a firm foundation , but_that expansion would be possible . It -isaia- Our pleasure , therefore_,_that all students from the Spanish peninsula and from the neighboring islands under the rule of the Catholic king be assembled in it under our guardianship . They are to live together under the direction of chosen authorities and devote_themselves to the study of those subjects which effectively develop their talents and their_minds . We contemplate donating a building in Rome suitable for this_work , a building named from its former owners , The Dukes of Altemps . It now belongs to Us and the Apostolic See . It -isaia- particularly appropriate since_it_-isaia- distinguished by the cemetery of St . Anicetus , Pope and Martyr , whose relics are kept there . It -isaia-_also noted for the fact_that St . Charles Borromeo once lived there . We therefore give the legal use of this dwelling to the Spanish college_of_bishops , with the condition that_they use it to receive and house clerics of their dioceses , should they decide to send some here for their studies . In order_that these plans may more quickly be carried_out , and that_there may be sufficient time to adapt the buildings and make_the other preparations , let_the clerics use a certain suitable portion of the house of the illustrious family Alteria . We designate the Archbishops of Toledo and Seville to deal_with Us and Our successors concerning all more_important matters of the college . For the same reason We decree that he who presides over the college must give a written account each year of its financial status , together_with a report concerning the discipline and conduct of the students , to Our Sacred Council of Studies , as well as to the archbishops mentioned above . They in turn will notify their colleagues , the Bishops of Spain . It -isaia-_now your part to assist and execute what We have begun . Do this as quickly and zealously as the matter demands and your episcopal virtue promises . Meanwhile We grant with love Our Apostolic Benediction as a testimony of Our special benevolence to you , Venerable Brethren , and also to the clergy and faithful entrusted_to_your vigilance . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . , , in the sixteenth year of Our Pontificate . LEO XIII REFERENCES : . Alexander VI in the bull Inter cetera , April , .
