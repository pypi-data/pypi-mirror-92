Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . The most noble nation of the French , besides many splendid achievements in peace and war , has deserved from the Catholic Church praise for special services , gratitude for which_will never die , and the glory of which_will never grow old . Having embraced Christianity -atti_degli_apostoli- the initiative of its King , Clovis , it was rewarded by this_most honourable testimony to its faith and piety , the title of eldest daughter of the Church . From that_time , Venerable Brethren , often have your ancestors been_the helpers of Providence itself in the performance of great and salutary works , and especially has their valour been illustrated in defending Catholicism throughout_the_world , in propagating the Christian Faith among barbarous nations , in delivering and protecting the more sacred places in Palestine , so that_it_-isaia- not_without cause that the ancient phrase , Gesta Dei per Francos , has become proverbial . And thus it has_been their happy lot , through faithful devotion to the Catholic cause , to become , as it were , associated_with the glories of the Church , and to found many public_and_private institutions marked by a singular strength of religious faith , charity , and greatness of soul . And these virtues of your fathers the Roman Pontiffs , Our predecessors , have_been accustomed greatly to commend , and , with the favour due to desert , have more_than_once heaped praises upon the French nation . Great indeed are the commendations which Innocent III . , those great lights of the Church , awarded to your ancestors ; the former , in his letter to the Archbishop of Reims , saying : '' We love the Kingdom of France with a kind of special and pre eminent love , inasmuch as it has_always_been obedient and devoted to Us and the Apostolic See , before all the other kingdoms of the world ; '' and the second , in a letter to St . , declaring that in the Kingdom of France , '' which_could never be torn away from its devotion to God and the Church , ecclesiastical liberty has_never perished , and Christian faith_has never -atti_degli_apostoli- any time lost its_proper vigour ; and that_for the preservation of these blessings the Kings and subjects of the said kingdom have_not hesitated for a moment to shed their blood and expose themselves to many dangers . '' And God , who_-isaia- the Father of nature , from whom States receive on earth the reward of their virtues and good deeds , has conferred much prosperity on France , fame in war , the arts of peace , national glory , and imperial power . And if France , forgetful , as it were , of herself , and neglecting the office conferred on her by God , has sometimes chosen to assume a hostile attitude towards_the Church , yet , by a special mercy of God , she_has not_for long , or as a whole nation , remained in these evil dispositions . And would that_she had escaped altogether unhurt from those disasters to religion and the State which times not far distant from our_own have brought forth ! But when_the human mind , filled_with_the poison of new opinions , had begun , in the pride of an untempered liberty , to reject the authority the Church , its downward course has_been rapid and precipitate . For when_the mortal poison of false doctrines had penetrated manners and customs themselves , society , to a great extent , came to fall away from Christianity . And in France the propagation of this plague was_not a little promoted by certain philosophers in the last century , professors of a foolish wisdom , who set themselves to root up the foundations of Christian truth , and started a system of philosophy calculated the more vehemently to inflame the desires after unlimited licence which_had_been already enkindled . Nor was_the help of these wanting whom an impotent hatred of religion binds together in unhallowed bonds , and daily renders more eager in the persecution of Catholics ; and whether emulation in this evil work was greater in France than anywhere else , nobody , Venerable Brethren , can be a better judge than yourselves . For these reasons , therefore , the fatherly love We bear to all the nations of the world , and which impelled Us to recall_the peoples of Ireland , Spain , and Italy to their_duty , when_the need arose , by Our letters to their Bishops has induced Us to turn Our attention and thought to France . The designs of which We have just spoken are injurious , not_only to religion , but are_also harmful and fatal to the State ; for it -isaia- impossible that prosperity should follow a State in which_the influence of religion_-isaia- extinguished . The moment man ceases to be in fear of God , he -isaia- deprived of the most necessary basis of justice , without_which even in the opinion of the Pagan philosophers society cannot exist ; the authority of rulers will lose its weight , and the laws of the land their force . Self interest will weigh more with every man than high principles , and the integrity of rights will be threatened , for the fear of punishment -isaia- but a bad guarantee for the fulfilment of duty ; those_who rule will easily be led to exceed the proper limits of their authority , and those_who obey seduced into sedition and revolt . Moreover , as there_-isaia-_nothing good in nature which_-isaia-_not to be referred to the Divine goodness , every human_society which_does its utmost to exclude God from its laws and its constitution , rejects the help of this Divine beneficence , and deserve , also , that help should be denied it . Rich , therefore , and powerful as it appears , that society bears within itself the seeds of death , and cannot hope_for a lengthy existence . It -isaia- , indeed , with Christian peoples as with individuals ; it -isaia- safety to follow_the counsels of God , it -isaia- danger to fall away from them ; and it often happens_that when nations jealously retain their fidelity to God and the Church , they arrive , almost naturally , -atti_degli_apostoli- the highest pitch of natural prosperity ; but that_when they fall away from it they perish . These facts are to be found in history ; and We could cite to you more_recent instances , even in your_own country , had We the time to recall_the events seen by a previous generation , when_the impiety of the mob shook France to its_very foundations , and Church and State perished in the same destruction . But , on the other_hand , these certain causes of the State s ruin are easily removed , if , in the constitution and ruling of the family and of society , the precepts are observed of the Catholic religion , for these_are most eminently fitted to preserve order and the welfare of the State . And first , as regards family_life , it -isaia- of the highest importance that the offspring of Christian marriages should be thoroughly instructed in the precepts of religion ; and that the various studies by which youth -isaia- fitted for the world should be joined with_that of religion . To divorce these -isaia- to wish_that youth should be neutral as regards its duties to God ; a system of education in itself fallacious , and particularly fatal in tender years , for it opens the door to atheism , and closes it on religion . Christian parents must , therefore , be careful that their_children receive religious instruction as soon as they_are capable of understanding it ; and that_nothing may , in the schools they attend , blemish their_faith or their morals . Both the Divine and the natural_law impose this_duty on them , nor_can parents on any ground whatever be freed from this obligation . The Church , guardian of the integrity of the Faith which , in virtue of its authority , deputed from God its Founder , has to call all nations to the knowledge of Christian lore , and which_-isaia- consequently bound to watch keenly over the teaching and upbringing of the children placed under its authority by baptism has_always expressly condemned mixed or neutral schools ; over and over again she_has warned parents to be ever on their guard in this_most essential point . To obey the Church in this_-isaia- to obey the requirements of social utility , and to serve in the most excellent manner the common welfare . Those , indeed , whose early days were_not enlightened by religious instruction , grow up without_any knowledge whatever of the greatest truths , which alone_can nourish in man the love of virtue , and repress in him his evil passions ; such as , for instance , the ideas of God the Creator , of God the Judge and Avenger , of the rewards and punishments in another life , of the heavenly help offered to us by Jesus Christ of the conscientious and holy fulfilment of our duties . Where these_are unknown , all intellectual culture will prove unhealthy ; young_people , unaccustomed to the fear of God , will_not endure the restraint of an upright life , they_will not venture even to deny anything to their passions , and will easily be seduced into troubling the State . Next , as regards those most beneficial and real principles relating to civil_society and the reciprocal rights_and_duties of the sacred and the political powers . For , as there_are on earth two principal societies , the one civil , the proximate end of which_-isaia- the temporal and worldly good of the human_race ; the other religious , whose office it -isaia- to lead mankind to that true , heavenly , and everlasting happiness for which_we_are created ; so these_are twin powers , both subordinate to the eternal law of nature , and each working for its_own ends in matters concerning its_own order and domain . But when anything has to be settled which for different reasons and in a different way concerns both powers , necessity and public utility demand_that an agreement shall be effected between_them , without_which an uncertain and unstable condition of things will be the result , totally inconsistent with the peace either of Church or State . When , therefore , a solemn public compact has been_made between_the sacred and the civil_power , then it -isaia- as much the interest of the State as it -isaia- just that the compact should remain inviolate ; because , as each power has services to render to the other , a certain and reciprocal advantage -isaia- enjoyed and conferred by each . In France , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this century , after_the previous public commotions and terrors had subsided , the rulers themselves understood that_they could_not more effectually relieve the State , wearied with so many ruins , than by the restoration of the Catholic religion . In anticipation of future advantages , Our predecessor , Pius VII , spontaneously acceded to the desire of the First Consul , and acted as indulgently as was consistent with_his duty . And when an agreement was reached as regarded the principal points , the bases were laid , and a safe course marked out for the restoration and gradual establishment of religion . Many prudent regulations , indeed , were made -atti_degli_apostoli- that and -atti_degli_apostoli- subsequent times for the safety and honour of the Church . And great were_the advantages derived therefrom , which_were all the more to be valued in consequence of the state of prostration and oppression into which religion had_been brought in France . With the restoration of public dignity to religion , Christian institutions manifestly revived ; and it was wonderful what an increase of civil prosperity was_the result . For when_the State had scarcely emerged from the tempestuous waves and was anxiously looking for firm foundations on which to base tranquillity and public order , it found the very thing which it desired opportunely offered to it by the Catholic Church , so that_it_was apparent that the idea of effecting an agreement with the latter was_the outcome of a prudent mind and a true regard_for the people s welfare . Wherefore , if there_were no other reasons for it , the same notice which led to the work of pacification being undertaken , ought now to operate for its maintenance . For now that the desire of innovation has_been enkindled everywhere , and in the existing uncertainty as to the future to sow fresh seeds of discord between_the two powers , and by the inter position of obstacles to fetter or delay the beneficial action of the Church , would be a course void of wisdom and full of peril . And yet we are troubled and grieved to see_that perils of this_kind are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time arising , for certain things opposed to the well_being of the Church have_been and are_being done , in consequence of the aroused mistrust and hatred of hostile minds against Catholic institutions , which_have_been wont to represent them as the enemies of the State . We are_also no less concerned and anxious -atti_degli_apostoli- the designs of these who , with the object of dividing the interests of Church and State , would wish to break , more or else rapidly , the salutary compact concluded with the Apostolic See . In this state of affairs We have neglected nothing which_the times seemed to call_for . Each time that it has appeared necessary to Us , We have ordered our Nuncio to make representations to the rulers of the State , which_they declared they received in a spirit disposed to do justice . We Ourselves , on the law being passed for the suppression of the religious_orders , made_known Our sentiments in a letter addressed to Our dear Son , Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church and Archbishop of Paris . Similarly , in a letter of June last , to the President of the Republic , We complained of certain acts injurious to the salvation_of_souls and infringing the rights of the Church . We have acted in this manner for the double reason_that it was_the duty of Our Apostolic office , and that we ardently desire_that France should preserve , with pious and inviolate fidelity , the religion it received_from its fathers and ancestors . In the same manner , with the same firmness and the same steadfastness , We will_never cease to defend the Catholic interests of France . In the carrying_out of that just and strict duty , You have all , Venerable Brethren , been Our strenuous supporters . Compelled to deplore the lot of the religious_orders , You have nevertheless done all that lay in Your power to prevent the fall of those_who deserved as well of the State as they_had done of the Church . At present , as far as the laws allow , You are applying your most earnest care and attention to procure for youth numerous facilities for a good education , nor are You backward in demonstrating how pernicious to the State itself are the plans which some men entertain against the Church . No one , therefore , will_have the right to accuse You of yielding to human considerations or of warring against the established order of things ; fot , when God s honour , when_the salvation_of_souls are endangered , the duty of your office -isaia- to take up the protection and defence of all such matters . Continue , therefore , to fulfil with prudence and firmness , the duties of your episcopal ministry ; teaching the precepts of heavenly doctrine , and pointing out to Your people the path to follow amid the great wickedness of the times . There must be a perfect union of mind and will , and where_the cause -isaia-_the_same , the mode of action should likewise be the same . See that schools are never wanting in which_the young may be carefully imbued_with the ideas of the rewards of heaven and of their_duties to God ; and in which_they may obtain accurate knowledge of the Church and learn submission to her teaching , so that_they_may understand and feel that_they_should be ready to brave all risks for it . France -isaia- rich in instances of eminent men_who have_not feared to face , for the Christian faith , all misfortunes and even the loss of life . In the social upheaval of which We spoke just now , many men of unconquerable faith were to be met with who maintained the honour of their_country with courage and their blood . We see virtue worthily maintaining itself , with God s help , in the midst of snares and perils . The clergy are attached to their_duty , and fulfil it with the charity ever ready and apt to help our neighbour , which_-isaia- proper to the priest . Large numbers of laymen openly and boldly profess the Catholic faith ; they rival one_another in the multiplication and variety of the testimonies of their devotion to the Holy See : they provide , -atti_degli_apostoli- great cost and -atti_degli_apostoli- great trouble , for the education of youth ; and they come forward in aid of public needs with admirable liberality and munificence . All this good , which affords the best hopes for the future of France , must_not only be preserved , but increased by united efforts and constant watchfulness . Above all , care must_be_taken that the ranks of the clergy shall be more_and_more filled_with worthy and capable men . Let the authority of their Bishops be sacred to the priest ; let_the latter be convinced_that their_ministry will be neither holy , nor profitable , nor respected , if it be not exercised under_the_guidance of their Bishops . The prominent laymen also , those devoted to Our common Mother the Church , and who are_able to render useful service to the Catholic religion by their word and by their pen , must multiply their_efforts in the defence of the Church . To obtain these results , it -isaia- an absolute necessity that wills should be in harmony , and the action unanimous . There -isaia- certainly nothing_more wished for by Our adversaries than dissensions between Catholics , who should avoid nothing with_greater care than_any disagreement , mindful of the Divine words : '' Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate . But if any one_-isaia- compelled , so that union may be preserved , to renounce his_own private opinion , let_him do it cheerfully for the common_good . Catholic writers must spare no effort to preserve this harmony in all things ; let_them prefer that_which_-isaia- of general utility to their_own private interests . Let them favour common action ; let_them willingly submit to those '' whom_the Holy Ghost has set as Bishops to rule over the Church of God ; '' let_them respect their authority and never undertake anything against the will of those they_should look on as their leaders in the battle for Catholic interests . Finally , following the invariable custom of the Church in times of difficulty , let all the faithful , under your direction , unceasingly pray and beseech God to look down on France that His mercy may overcome his wrath . The unbridled license of speech and of the press , has many times outraged the Majesty of God ; men are_not wanting who not_only ungratefully repudiate the benefits of Jesus Christ , the Saviour of the world , but_even go so far in their impiety as to glory in not believing in the existence of God . To Catholics will fall the duty of making reparation by a great spirit of faith and piety for these perverse aberrations of mind and deed , and of publicly proving that_they_have nothing_more -atti_degli_apostoli- heart than the glory of God , nothing dearer than the religion of their forefathers . Those especially , whose life_-isaia- passed in more intimate_union with God in the cloister , should excite themselves to more_and_more generous charity , and strive to appease the Lord by their humble prayers , voluntary self denials , and offering of self . And thus , with the help of the Divine Mercy , we are confident that the strayed will come to repentance , and the name of France will regain its ancient greatness . In all that We have hitherto said , Venerable Brethren , You will see the fatherly love and deep affection which We bear to the whole of France . We doubt not that_this testimony of Our most keen anxiety will tend to strengthen and tighten the necessary bond_between France and the Holy See a union which_has ever been -atti_degli_apostoli- all times a source of mutual , numerous , and important advantages . Gladdened with this thought , Venerable Brethren , We implore for You and your faithful the greatest abundance of heavenly graces ; and We grant You most lovingly in the Lord as a pledge and testimony of Our especial good_will , to You and to the whole of France , the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s the th day of February , , in the sixth year of Our Pontificate .
