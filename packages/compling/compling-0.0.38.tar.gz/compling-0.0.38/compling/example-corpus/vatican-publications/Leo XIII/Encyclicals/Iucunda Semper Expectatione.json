Venerable Brethren , Greeting and Apostolic Benediction . It -isaia- always with joyful expectation and inspired hope_that We look forward to the return of the month of October . At Our exhortation and by Our express order this month has_been consecrated to the Blessed Virgin , during which for some years now the devotion of her Rosary has_been practised by Catholic nations throughout_the_world with sedulous earnestness . Our reasons for making this_exhortation We have made_known more_than_once . For as the disastrous condition of the Church and of Society proved to Us the extreme necessity for signal aid from God , it was manifest to Us that aid should be sought through the intercession of His Mother , and by the express means of the Rosary , which Christians have ever found to be of marvellous avail . This indeed has_been well proved since_the very institution of the devotion , both in the vindication of Holy Faith against the furious attacks of heresy , and in restoring to honour the virtues , which by reason of the Age s corruption , required to be rekindled and sustained . And this_same proof was continued in all succeeding ages , by a never failing series of private and public benefits , whereof the illustrious remembrance -isaia- everywhere perpetuated and immortalized by monuments and existing institutions . Likewise in Our age , afflicted with_that tempest of various evils , it -isaia- a joy to Our soul to relate the beneficent influence of the Rosary . Notwithstanding all this , you yourselves , Venerable Brethren , behold with your_own eyes the persistence nay , the increase of the reasons for renewing again this_year Our summons to the Faithful to turn with increased ardour in prayer to Mary , the Queen of Heaven . Besides , the more We fix Our thoughts upon the character of the Rosary , the clearer its excellence and power appear to Us . Hence , while Our wish increases that_it_may flourish , Our hope grows also that_through Our recommendation it may come to be more greatly prized , its holy use become more extended and flourish abundantly . But We shall_not now return to the various instructions which in past years We have_given upon this_subject . We shall take instead the opportunity of pointing out the particular ruling and designs of Providence which ordains that the Rosary should_have new power to instil confidence into the hearts of those_who pray , and new influence to move the compassionate heart of Our Mother to comfort and succour Us with the utmost bounty . The recourse we have to Mary in prayer follows upon the office she continuously fills by the side of the throne of God as Mediatrix of Divine grace ; being by worthiness and by merit most acceptable to Him , and , therefore , surpassing in power all the angels and saints in Heaven . Now , this merciful office of hers , perhaps , appears in no other form of prayer so manifestly as it does in the Rosary . For in the Rosary all the part that Mary took as our co Redemptress comes to us , as it were , set_forth , and in such wise as though the facts were even then taking place ; and this with much profit to our piety , whether in the contemplation of the succeeding sacred mysteries , or in the prayers which we speak and repeat with the lips . First come the Joyful Mysteries . The Eternal Son of God stoops to mankind , putting on its_nature ; but_with the assent of Mary , who conceives Him by the Holy Ghost . John the Baptist , by a singular privilege , -isaia- sanctified in his_mother s womb and favoured with_special graces that_he_might prepare the way of the Lord ; and this comes to pass by the greeting of Mary who had_been inspired to visit her cousin . At last the expected of nations comes to light , Christ the Saviour . The Virgin bears Him . And when_the Shepherds and the wise men , first fruits of the Christian faith , come with longing to His cradle , they find there the young Child , with Mary , His Mother . Then , that He might before men offer Himself as a victim to His Heavenly Father , He desires to be taken to the Temple ; and by the hands of Mary He -isaia- there presented to the Lord . It -isaia- Mary who , in the mysterious losing of her Son , seeks Him sorrowing , and finds Him again with_joy . And the same truth_-isaia- told again in the sorrowful mysteries . In the Garden of Gethsemane , where Jesus -isaia- in an agony ; in the judgment hall , where He -isaia- scourged , crowned with thorns , condemned to death , not there do we find Mary . But she knew beforehand all these agonies ; she knew and saw them . When she professed herself the handmaid of the Lord for the mother s office , and when , -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the altar , she offered up her whole self with_her Child Jesus then and thereafter she took her part in the laborious expiation made by her Son for the sins of the world . It -isaia- certain , therefore_,_that she suffered in the very depths of her soul with His most bitter sufferings and with His torments . Moreover , it was before the eyes of Mary that_was to be finished the Divine Sacrifice for_which she had borne and brought up the Victim . As we contemplate Him in the last and most piteous of those Mysteries , there stood by the Cross of Jesus His Mother , who , in a miracle of charity , so that_she might receive us as her sons , offered generously to Divine Justice her_own Son , and died in her_heart with Him , stabbed with the sword of sorrow . Thence the Rosary takes us on to the Glorious Mysteries , wherein likewise -isaia-_revealed the mediation of the great Virgin , still_more abundant in fruitfulness . She rejoices in heart over the glory of her Son triumphant over death , and follows Him with a mother s love in His Ascension to His eternal kingdom ; but , though worthy of Heaven , she abides a while on earth , so that the infant Church may be directed and comforted by her '' who penetrated , beyond all belief , into the deep secrets of Divine wisdom '' St . Nevertheless , for the fulfilment of the task of human redemption there remains still the coming of the Holy Ghost , promised by Christ . And behold , Mary -isaia- in the room , and there , praying with the Apostles and entreating for them_with sobs and tears , she hastens for the Church the coming of the Spirit , the Comforter , the supreme gift of Christ , the treasure that will_never fail . And later , without measure and without end will she be able to plead our cause , passing upon a day to the life immortal . Therefore we behold her taken up from this valley of tears into the heavenly Jerusalem , amid choirs of Angels . And we honour her , glorified above all the Saints , crowned with stars by her Divine Son and seated -atti_degli_apostoli- His side the sovereign Queen of the universe . If in all this series of Mysteries , Venerable Brethren , are developed the counsels of God in regard to us '' counsels of wisdom and of tenderness '' St . Bernard not less apparent -isaia- the greatness of the benefits for which_we_are debtors to the Virgin Mother . No man can meditate upon these without feeling a new awakening in his_heart of confidence that he will certainly obtain through Mary the fulness of the mercies of God . And to this_end vocal prayer chimes well with the Mysteries . First , as -isaia- meet and right , comes the Lord s Prayer , addressed to Our Father in Heaven : and having , with the elect petitions dictated by Our Divine Master , called_upon the Father , from the throne of His Majesty we turn our prayerful voices to Mary . Thus -isaia- confirmed that law of merciful meditation of which We have spoken , and which St . Bernardine of Siena thus expresses : '' Every grace granted to man_has three degrees in order ; for by God it -isaia- communicated to Christ , from Christ it passes to the Virgin , and from the Virgin it descends to us . '' And we , by the very form of the Rosary , do linger longest , and , as it were , by preference upon the last and lowest of these steps , repeating by decades the Angelic Salutation , so that with_greater confidence we may thence attain to the higher degrees that_-isaia- , may rise , by means of Christ , to the Divine Father . For if thus we again_and_again greet Mary , it -isaia- precisely that_our failing and defective prayers may be strengthened with the necessary confidence ; as though we pledged her to pray_for us , and as it were in our name , to God . Nor can our prayers fail to ascend to Him as a sweet savour , commended by the prayers of the Virgin . And He it -isaia- who , all benign , invites her : '' Let thy voice sound in My ears , for thy voice -isaia- sweet . '' For this cause do we repeatedly celebrate those glorious titles of her ministry as Mediatrix . Her do we greet who found favour with God , and who_was in a signal manner filled_with grace by Him so that the superabundance thereof might overflow upon all men ; her , united with the Lord by the most intimate of all conjunction ; her who_was blessed among women , and who '' alone took away the curse and bore the blessing '' St . Thomas that fruit of her womb , that happy fruit , in which all the nations of the earth are blessed . Her do we invoke , finally , as Mother of God ; and in virtue of a dignity so sublime what graces from her may we not promise to ourselves , sinners , in life and in the agonies of the end ? . A soul that shall devoutly repeat these prayers , that shall ponder with_faith these mysteries , will , without_doubt , be filled_with wonder -atti_degli_apostoli- the Divine purposes in this_great Virgin and in the work of the restoration of mankind . Doubtless , this soul , moved by the warmth of love for_her and of confidence , will desire to take refuge upon her breast , as was_the sweet feeling of St . Bernard : '' Remember , O most pious Virgin Mary , that never was it heard that any who fled to thy protection , called_upon thy help , and sought thy intercession , was left forsaken . '' But the fruits of the Rosary appear likewise , and with equal greatness , in the turning with mercy of the heart of the Mother of God towards us . How sweet a happiness must it be for_her to see us all intent upon the task of weaving crowns for_her of righteous prayers and lovely praises ! And if , indeed , by those prayers we desire to render to God the glory which_-isaia- His due ; if we protest that we seek nothing whatsoever except the fulfilment in us of His holy will ; if we magnify His goodness and graciousness ; if we call Him Our Father ; if we , being most unworthy , yet entreat of Him His best blessings Oh , how shall Mary in all these_things rejoice ! How shall she magnify the Lord ! There -isaia- no language so fit to lead us to the majesty of God as the language of the Lord s Prayer . Furthermore , to each of these_things for_which we pray , things_that_are righteous and are ordered , and are in harmony_with Christian faith , hope , and charity , -isaia- added a special joy for the Blessed Virgin . With our voices she seems to hear also the voice of her Divine Son , Who with His own mouth taught us this_prayer , and by His own authority commanded it , saying : '' You shall pray thus . '' And seeing how we observe that command , saying our Rosary , she_will bend towards us with the more loving solicitude ; and the mystical crowns we offer her will be to her welcome , and to us fruitful of graces . And of this generosity of Mary to our supplications we have no slight pledge in the very nature of a practice that_has the power to help us in praying well . In many_ways , indeed , -isaia-_man apt , by his frailty , to allow his thoughts to wander from God and to let his purpose go astray . But the Rosary , if rightly considered , will be found to have in itself special virtues , whether for producing and continuing a state of recollection , or for touching the conscience for its healing , or for lifting up the soul . As all men know , it -isaia- composed of two parts , distinct but inseparable the meditation of the Mysteries and the recitation of the prayers . It -isaia- thus a kind of prayer that requires not_only some raising of the soul to God , but_also a particular and explicit attention , so that by reflection upon the things to be contemplated , impulses and resolutions may follow for the reformation and sanctification of life . Those same things_are , in fact , the most important and the most admirable of Christianity , the things through_which the world was renewed and filled_with_the fruits of truth , justice , and peace . And it -isaia- remarkable how well adapted to every_kind of mind , however unskilled , -isaia- the manner in which these_things are proposed to us in the Rosary . They are proposed less as truths or doctrines to be speculated upon than as present facts to be seen and perceived . Thus presented , with the circumstances of place , time , and persons , these Mysteries produce the most living effect ; and this without_the slightest effort of imagination ; for they_are treated as things learnt and engraven in the heart from infancy . Thus , hardly -isaia- a Mystery named but the pious soul goes through it with ease of thought and quickness of feeling , and gathers therefrom , by the gift of Mary , abundance of the food of Heaven . And yet another title of joy and of acceptation in her eyes do our crowns of prayer acquire . For every time that we look once_more with devotional remembrance upon these Mysteries we give her a sign of the gratitude of our_hearts ; we prove to her that we cannot often enough call to mind the blessings of her unwearied charity in the work of our_salvation . At such recollections , practised by us with the frequency of love in her presence , who may express , who may even conceive , what ever_new joys overflow her ever blessed soul , and what tender affections arise therein , of mercy and of a mother s love ! Besides these recollections , moreover , as the sacred Mysteries pass by they cause our prayers to be transformed into impulses of entreaty that_have an indescribable power over the heart of Mary . Yes , we fly to thee , we miserable children of Eve , O holy Mother of God . To thee we lift our prayers , for thou art the Mediatrix , powerful -atti_degli_apostoli- once and pitiful , of our_salvation . Oh , by the sweetness of the joys that came to thee from thy Son Jesus , by thy participation in His ineffable sorrows , by the splendours of His glory shining in thee , we instantly beseech thee , listen , be pitiful , hear us , unworthy though we be ! . Thus the excellence of the Rosary ; considered under the double aspect We have here set_forth , will convince you , Venerable Brethren , of the reasons We have for an incessant eagerness to commend and to promote it . At the present_day and on this We have_already touched there_-isaia- a signal necessity of special help from Heaven , particularly manifest in the many tribulations suffered by the Church as to her liberties and her rights , as also in the perils whereby_the prosperity and peace of Christian society are fundamentally threatened . So it -isaia- that it belongs to Our office to assert once_again that We place the best of Our hopes in the holy Rosary , inasmuch as more_than any_other means it can impetrate from God the succour which We need . It -isaia- Our ardent wish_that this_devotion shall be restored to the place of honour ; in the city and in the village , in the family and in the workshop , in the noble s house and in the peasant s ; that it should be to all a dear devotion and a noble sign of their_faith ; that_it_may be a sure way to the gaining of the favour of pardon . To this_end it -isaia- indispensable that zeal should be redoubled , while impiety daily redoubles its efforts and labours to move the justice of God and to provoke , for the general ruin , His terrible vengeance . Amongst so many causes of grief to all good men , and to Ourself , not the least -isaia- this , that in the very midst of Catholic nations there exist persons_who are ever ready to rejoice in that_which insults and outrages our august religion ; and that they_themselves , with incredible effrontery and with all publicity , seize every opportunity of teaching the multitude to hold reverend things in contempt and of persuading them_from their old confidence in the intercession of the Blessed Virgin . During the last months the very person of Our Divine Redeemer has not_been spared . Such a depth of shameless indignity has_been reached that Jesus Christ Himself has_been dragged upon the stage of a theatre often contaminated with corruptions , and has_been represented there discrowned of that Divinity upon which rests the whole work of human salvation . And the last touch of shame was added in an attempt to rescue from the execration of ages the guilty name of him_who was_the very sign of perfidy , the betrayer of Christ . At the consummation of such excesses in the cities of Italy there arose a general cry of indignation , and energetic protest against the violation and trampling under foot of the inviolable rights of religion , and this in a nation that_has for its greatest and most righteous boast that_it_-isaia- Catholic . The Bishops rose -atti_degli_apostoli- once , on fire with holy zeal . And first they made their vigorous appeal to those_whose sacred duty it -isaia- to safeguard the decorum of the religion of the country . Next , they informed their_people of the gravity of the scandal , and exhorted them to special acts of reparation towards our most loving Saviour exposed to such slanders . We have pleasure , however , in rendering praise to the free and fruitful faith manifested by men_of_good will ; and this_has brought Us comfort in the bitterness inflicted upon the very quick of Our heart . And having regard to the duties of Our supreme ministry , We take this occasion to lift up Our voice and to unite Our complaints and protests to those of the Bishops and of their_people , authenticated by Our Apostolic authority . And with a like ardour to that wherewith we condemned this sacrilegious offence , do We preach faith to all Catholics , and particularly to the Italians . Let them_with jealous care guard this inestimable inheritance received_from their fathers , let_them defend it with courage , let_them not_cease from magnifying it with_good actions of which their faith_-isaia- the inspiring motive . This -isaia- a motive the more for the enkindling , in private and in common prayer , throughout_the coming month of October , of a holy emulation in celebrating and honouring the Mother of God , the mighty succourer of the Christian people , the most glorious Queen of Heaven . For Our own part , We confirm with all Our heart_the favours and indulgences We have_already awarded upon this_point . Now may God , '' Who in His most merciful Providence gave us this Mediatrix , '' and '' decreed that all good should come to us by the hands of Mary '' St . Bernard , receive propitiously our_common prayers and fulfil our_common hopes . May you receive a pledge thereof in the Apostolic Benediction which We give to you , to your_clergy , and to your_people , with all affection in Our Lord . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on September , , in the seventeenth year_of_our Pontificate .
