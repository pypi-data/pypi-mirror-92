Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . But a short time ago , as you well know , We , by letters apostolic , and following the custom and ordinances of Our predecessors , commanded the celebration in this city , -atti_degli_apostoli- no distant date , of a Holy Year . And now to day , in the hope and with the object that_this religious celebration shall be more devoutly performed , We have traced and recommended a striking design from which , if all shall follow it out with hearty good_will , We not unreasonably expect extraordinary and lasting benefits for Christendom in the first_place and also_for the whole_human_race . Already more_than_once We have endeavored , after_the example of Our predecessors Innocent XII , Benedict XIII , Clement XIII , Pius VI , and Pius IX . , devoutly to foster and bring out into fuller light that_most excellent form of devotion which_has for its object the veneration of the Sacred Heart of Jesus ; this We did especially by the Decree given on June , , by which We raised the Feast under that name to the dignity of the first class . But now We have in mind a more signal form of devotion which shall be in a manner the crowning perfection of all the honors that people_have been accustomed to pay to the Sacred Heart , and which We confidently trust will be most pleasing to Jesus Christ , our Redeemer . This -isaia- not the first time , however_,_that the design of which We speak has_been mooted . Twenty five years_ago , on the approach of the solemnities of the second centenary of the Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque s reception of the Divine command to propagate the worship of the Sacred Heart , many letters from all parts , not merely from private persons but_from Bishops also were sent to Pius IX . begging that he would consent to consecrate the whole_human_race to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus . It was thought best -atti_degli_apostoli- the time to postpone the matter in order_that a well considered decision might be arrived -atti_degli_apostoli- . Meanwhile permission was granted to individual cities which desired it thus to consecrate themselves , and a form of consecration was drawn up . Now , for certain new and additional reasons , We consider that the plan -isaia- ripe for fulfilment . This world wide and solemn testimony of allegiance and piety -isaia-_especially appropriate to Jesus Christ , who_-isaia- the Head and Supreme Lord of the race . His empire extends not_only over Catholic nations and those_who , having_been duly washed in the waters of holy baptism , belong of right to the Church , although erroneous opinions keep them astray , or dissent from her teaching cuts them off from her care ; it comprises also all those_who_are deprived of the Christian faith , so that the whole_human_race -isaia- most truly under the power of Jesus Christ . For He who_-isaia- the Only begotten Son of God the Father , having the same substance with Him and being the brightness of His glory and the figure of His substance Hebrews i . , necessarily has everything in common with the Father , and therefore sovereign power over all things . This -isaia- why_the Son of God thus speaks of Himself through the Prophet : '' But I -amos- appointed king by him over Sion , his holy mountain . The Lord said to me , Thou art my son , this_day have I begotten thee . Ask of me and I will_give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance and the utmost parts of the earth for thy possession '' Psalm , ii . By these_words He declares that He has power from God over the whole Church , which_-isaia- signified by Mount Sion , and also over the rest of the world to its uttermost ends . On what foundation this sovereign power rests -isaia- made sufficiently plain by the words , '' Thou art My Son . '' For by the very fact_that He -isaia- the Son of the King of all , He -isaia-_also the heir of all His Father s power : hence_the words '' I will_give thee the Gentiles for thy inheritance , '' which_are similar to those used by Paul the Apostle , '' whom he bath appointed heir of all things '' Hebrews i . But we should now give most special consideration to the declarations made by Jesus Christ , not through the Apostles or the Prophets but by His own words . To the Roman Governor who asked Him , '' Art thou a king then ? '' He answered unhesitatingly , '' Thou sayest that I -amos- a king '' John xviii . And the greatness of this_power and the boundlessness of His kingdom -isaia- still more_clearly declared in these_words to the Apostles : '' All power -isaia- given to me in heaven and on earth '' Matthew xxviii . If then all power has_been_given to Christ it follows of necessity that His empire must be supreme , absolute and independent of the will of any_other , so that none -isaia- either equal or like unto it : and since it has_been_given in heaven and on earth it ought to have heaven and earth obedient to it . And verily he has acted on this extraordinary and peculiar right when He commanded His Apostles to preach His doctrine over the earth , to gather all men together into the one_body of the Church by the baptism of salvation , and to bind them by laws , which no one could reject without risking his eternal_salvation . But this_-isaia-_not all . Christ reigns nor only by natural right as the Son of God , but_also by a right that He has acquired . For He it was who snatched us '' from the power of darkness '' Colossians i . , , and '' gave Himself for the redemption of all '' I Timothy ii . Therefore not_only Catholics , and those_who_have duly received Christian baptism , but_also all men , individually and collectively , have_become to Him '' a purchased people '' I Peter ii . Augustine s words are therefore to the point when he says : '' You ask what price He paid ? See what He gave and you will understand how_much He paid . The price was_the blood of Christ . What could cost so much but the whole_world , and all its people ? The great price He paid was paid for all '' T . How it comes about_that infidels themselves are subject to the power and dominion of Jesus Christ -isaia- clearly shown by St . Thomas , who_gives us the reason and its explanation . For having put the question whether His judicial power extends to all men , and having stated_that judicial authority flows naturally from royal authority , he concludes decisively as follows : '' All things_are subject to Christ as far as His power -isaia- concerned , although they_are_not all subject to Him in the exercise of that power '' a . This sovereign power of Christ over men -isaia- exercised by truth , justice , and above all , by charity . To this twofold ground of His power and domination He graciously allows us , if we think fit , to add voluntary consecration . Jesus Christ , our God and our Redeemer , -isaia- rich in the fullest and perfect possession of all things : we , on the other_hand , are so poor and needy that_we_have nothing of our_own to offer Him as a gift . But yet , in His infinite goodness and love , He in no way objects to our giving and consecrating to Him what -isaia-_already His , as if it were really our_own ; nay , far from refusing such an offering , He positively desires it and asks for it : '' My son , give me thy heart . '' We are , therefore , able to be pleasing to Him by the good_will and the affection of our soul . For by consecrating ourselves to Him we not_only declare our open and free acknowledgment and acceptance of His authority over us , but we also testify that if what we offer as a gift were really our_own , we would still offer it with_our whole heart . We also beg of Him that He would vouchsafe to receive it from us , though clearly His own . Such -isaia- the efficacy of the act of which We speak , such_-isaia- the meaning underlying Our words . And since there_-isaia- in the Sacred Heart a symbol and a sensible image of the infinite love of Jesus Christ which moves us to love one_another , therefore -isaia- it fit and proper that_we_should consecrate ourselves to His most Sacred Heart an act which_-isaia- nothing else than an offering and a binding of oneself to Jesus Christ , seeing that whatever honor , veneration and love_-isaia- given to this_divine Heart -isaia- really and truly given to Christ Himself . For these reasons We urge and exhort all who know and love this_divine Heart willingly to undertake this act of piety ; and it -isaia- Our earnest desire_that all should make it on the same day , that so the aspirations of so many thousands who_are performing this act of consecration may be borne to the temple of heaven on the same day . But shall We allow to slip from Our remembrance those innumerable others upon whom_the light of Christian truth has not_yet shined ? We hold the place of Him who came to save that_which was lost , and who shed His blood for the salvation of the whole_human_race . And so We greatly desire to bring to the true life those_who sit in the shadow of death . As we have_already sent messengers of Christ over the earth to instruct them , so now , in pity for their lot with all Our soul we commend them , and as far as in us lies We consecrate them to the Sacred Heart of Jesus . In this_way this act of devotion , which We recommend , will be a blessing to all . For having performed it , those in whose hearts are the knowledge and love of Jesus Christ will feel that_faith and love increased . Those who knowing Christ , yet neglect His law and its precepts , may still gain from His Sacred Heart the flame of charity . And lastly , for those still_more unfortunate , who_are struggling in the darkness of superstition , we shall all with one mind implore the assistance of heaven that Jesus Christ , to whose power they_are subject , may also one_day render them submissive to its exercise ; and that not_only in the life to come when He will fulfil His will upon all men , by saving some and punishing others , St . Thomas , ibid , but_also in this mortal life by giving them faith and holiness . May they by these virtues strive to honor God as they ought , and to win everlasting happiness in heaven . Such an act of consecration , since it can establish or draw tighter the bonds which naturally connect public affairs with God , gives to States a hope of better things . In these latter times especially , a policy has_been followed which_has resulted in a sort of wall being raised between_the Church and civil_society . In the constitution and administration of States the authority of sacred and divine law_-isaia- utterly disregarded , with_a_view to the exclusion of religion from having any constant part in public_life . This policy almost tends to the removal of the Christian faith from our midst , and , if that were possible , of the banishment of God Himself from the earth . When men s minds are raised to such a height of insolent pride , what wonder -isaia- it that the greater part of the human_race should_have fallen into such disquiet of mind and be buffeted by waves so rough that no one_-isaia- suffered to be free_from anxiety and peril ? When religion_-isaia- once discarded it follows of necessity that the surest foundations of the public welfare must give way , whilst God , to inflict on His enemies the punishment they so richly deserve , has left them the prey of their_own evil desires , so that_they give themselves up to their passions and finally wear themselves out by excess of liberty . Hence that abundance of evils which_have now for a long time settled upon the world , and which pressingly call_upon us to seek for help from Him by whose strength alone they_can be driven away . Who can He be but Jesus Christ the Only begotten Son of God ? '' For there_-isaia- no other name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved '' Acts iv . We must have_recourse to Him who_-isaia- the Way , the Truth and the Life . We have gone astray and we must return to the right path : darkness has overshadowed our minds , and the gloom must be dispelled by the light of truth : death has seized upon us , and we must lay hold of life . It will -atti_degli_apostoli- length be possible that_our many wounds be healed and all justice spring forth again with the hope of restored authority ; that the splendors of peace be renewed , and swords and arms drop from the hand when all men shall acknowledge_the empire of Christ and willingly obey His word , and '' Every tongue shall confess that_our Lord Jesus Christ -isaia- in the glory of God the Father '' Philippians ii , II . When the Church , in the days immediately succeeding her institution , wasoppressed beneath the yoke of the Caesars , a young Emperor saw in the heavens across , which became -atti_degli_apostoli- once the happy omen and cause of the glorious victorythat soon followed . And now , to day , behold another blessed and heavenly tokenis offered to our sight the most Sacred Heart of Jesus , with a cross rising fromit and shining forth with dazzling splendor amidst flames of love . In thatSacred Heart all our hopes should be placed , and from it the salvation of men isto be confidently besought . Finally , there_-isaia-_one motive which We are unwilling to pass over in silence , personal to Ourselves it -isaia- true , but still good and weighty , which moves Us to undertake this celebration . God , the author of every good , not long ago preserved Our life by curing Us of a dangerous disease . We now wish , by this increase of the honor paid to the Sacred Heart , that the memory of this_great mercy should be brought prominently forward , and Our gratitude be publicly acknowledged . For these reasons , We ordain that on the ninth , tenth and eleventh of thecoming monthof June , in the principal church of every town and village , certain prayers besaid , and on each of these_days there be added to the other prayers the Litanyof the Sacred Heart approved by Our authority . On the last day the form ofconsecration shall be recited which , Venerable Brethren , We sent to you withthese letters . As a pledge of divine benefits , and in token of Our paternal benevolence , toyou , and to the clergy_and_people committed to your_care We lovingly grant inthe Lord the Apostolic Benediction . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s on the th day of May , , the twenty second year of Our Pontificate .
