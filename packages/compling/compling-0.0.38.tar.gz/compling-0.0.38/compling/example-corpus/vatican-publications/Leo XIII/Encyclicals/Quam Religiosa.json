Peru and Christianity The great religious persistence with_which Peru adhered to the Catholic faith_-isaia- a praiseworthy distinction for that illustrious country . This same nation -isaia- united with Us and with the Apostolic See through allegiance and choice . A number of things show this , among which_are the prayers addressed to Us to support the holy missions in the remotest districts of that land . Priests and religious are needed , men whose devotion and piety would be nourished by skill and zeal for daily growth . We remember with pleasure that a large group of Catholics from the entire country met two years_ago in the capital of Peru , knowledgeable and virtuous men distinguished by their position and wealth . From this group a certain new and joyful spiritual love burst forth . Without hesitation they zealously promoted the faith of their fathers , and with reverence and love they followed this See of Peter in public discussions . Venerable brothers , We have_never avoided any opportunity to show Our singular good_will toward Peru with increased encouragement and open proof of Our benevolence . There are_many things We do not want to pass by , among which_-isaia- this : Peru has attained much dignity and authority from the honors and special privileges attributed by the Apostolic See to its bishop . These distinctions fill Us with a certain hope_that in whatever manner your ancestors carried_out their wonderful work , from this moment on the leaders of Peru might employ as much effort on behalf of these_matters . Furthermore , We hope that_they_will fully approve everything which their steadfastness in defending the Catholic faith_has lawfully conferred on them . Civil Marriage in Peru . It -isaia- with sorrow that We view the recently disseminated law in Peru . Under the appearance of regulating the marriage of non Catholics , it introduced in effect , what_-isaia- called a civil marriage , even_though that law does_not affect people of all conditions . What -isaia- more , putting aside the authority of the Church , a civil ceremony -isaia- permitted for mixed marriages whenever the Holy See , for serious reasons and for the eternal_salvation of the Christian family , would consider it inappropriate to exempt anyone from the law forbidding marriage between those of different faiths . We were seriously upset by these events , which_have_been perpetrated in violation of the obedience due to Our dignity and to the authority divinely invested in Our supreme ministry . We urge you to preserve safe and sound the Catholic teaching on marriage and assure the preservation of the Peruvian faithful . Church Doctrine on Marriage . We are_concerned about the whole Christian flock , as Our apostolic duties require , for We have_given frequent instruction concerning the sanctity of marriage . Jesus Christ , the author of the new_covenant , translated the duty of nature into sacraments , and this_duty cannot be divorced from religion and immersed in worldly of fairs . Preceded by sacred rite , it can bring_about a more tranquil and happy life_for the spouses , strengthen family harmony , raise children more correctly , and suitably provide_for the welfare of its community . Indeed , We have treated this_matter in greater detail in Our apostolic_letter Arcanum divinae sapientiae consilium . In that letter We wanted to remind the faithful of the vigilant cares which_the Church has shown for preserving the honor and sanctity of marriage , for the Church -isaia- the best guardian and avenger of mankind . We also reminded the civil authorities of what matters they could rightfully regulate . It -isaia- not necessary_for Us to bring each of these examples to your attention . It -isaia- , however , relevant to mention again that the leaders of the state have authority in human affairs which led to marriage and generally concern civil matters . However , in the truly Christian marriage , they_have no authority , for this_matter should be left to the jurisdiction of the Church , which_-isaia-_not established by men . If the marriage contract -isaia- properly performed that_-isaia- , as Christ established it then they will_be_able to see if anything which pertains to civil law might follow . It -isaia- Catholic teaching that the dignity of the sacrament adds to the marriage of Christians ; nobody can depart from this without losing faith . For that_reason , these_matters should be governed by the divine authority of the Church alone . No marriage can be considered firmly ratified unless it -isaia- joined according to Church law and discipline . It -isaia- easy to understand from this_that wherever the Tridentine law of the chapter Tametsi would_have been correctly promulgated , then any marriage contracted against its prescription should be considered null and void . That Tridentine law was not_only promulgated in Peru , but it has_been enforced for a long time and faithfully observed . Therefore , the Apostolic See strongly desires to keep this_teaching . Venerable Brothers , instruct the flock entrusted_to_your care more clearlyand fully , so they_do_not remain unaware of any part of this serious matter , which greatly concerns the eternal_salvation of many of them . We also want youto use your authority and advice to influence those_who_are empowered to makelaws in Peru . Enter into_their favor , so they consider_the example of theCatholic people . The courage of the blessed citizens Turibius and Rose , greatexamples of virtue , comes to mind here . Publicly restore both mind and will , sothat they never depart from the Church s precepts in making laws , which , ifcorrectly observed , will bring_about the natural happiness of the people . Theyshould promise that_they_will not_allow the recent decree to stand unchanged . They should_also promise that civil marriage laws will contain nothing contraryto the teaching of the Church . Meanwhile , filled_with_the hope of divine assistance and confident in your zeal and skill , We lovingly bestow Our apostolic_blessing as a pledge of heavenly_gifts and as a sign of Our special good wishes for you , Venerable Brothers , and for all the clergy_and_people entrusted to each of you .
