JOSEPH To Our Venerable Brethren the Patriarchs , Primates , Archbishops , and other Ordinaries , in Peace and Union with Holy See . Although We have_already many times ordered special prayers to be offered up in the whole_world , that the interests of Catholicism might be insistently recommended to God , none will deem it matter for surprise that We consider_the present moment an opportune one for again inculcating the same duty . During periods of stress and trial chiefly when every lawlessness of act seems permitted to the powers of darkness it has been_the custom in the Church to plead with_special fervour and perseverance to God , her author and protector , by recourse to the intercession of the saints and chiefly of the Blessed Virgin , Mother of God whose patronage has_ever been_the most efficacious . The fruit of these pious prayers and of the confidence reposed in the Divine goodness , has_always , sooner or later , been_made apparent . Now , Venerable Brethren , you know_the times in which we live ; they_are scarcely less deplorable for the Christian religion than the worst days , which in time past were most full of misery to the Church . We see faith , the root of all the Christian virtues , lessening in many souls ; we see charity growing cold ; the young generation daily growing in depravity of morals and views ; the Church of Jesus Christ attacked on every side by open force or by craft ; a relentless war waged against the Sovereign Pontiff ; and the very foundations of religion undermined with a boldness which waxes daily in intensity . These things_are , indeed , so much a matter of notoriety that_it_-isaia- needless for Us to expatiate on the depths to which society has sunk in these_days , or on the designs which now agitate the minds_of_men . In circumstances so unhappy and troublous , human remedies are insufficient , and it becomes necessary , as a sole resource , to beg for assistance from the Divine power . This -isaia- the reason_why We have considered it necessary to turn to the Christian people and urge them to implore , with increased zeal and constancy , the aid of Almighty God . At this proximity of the month of October , which We have_already consecrated to the Virgin Mary , under the title of Our Lady of the Rosary , We earnestly exhort the faithful to perform the exercises of this month with , if possible , even_more piety and constancy than heretofore . We know that_there_-isaia- sure help in the maternal goodness of the Virgin , and We are_very certain_that We shall never vainly place Our trust in her . If , on innumerable occasions , she_has displayed her power in aid of the Christian world , why should We doubt_that she_will now renew the assistance of her power and favour , if humble and constant prayers are offered up on all sides to her ? Nay , We rather believe_that her intervention will be the more marvellous as she_has permitted Us to pray to her , for so long a time , with_special appeals . But We entertain another object , which , according to your wont , Venerable Brethren , you will advance with fervour . That God may be more favourable to Our prayers , and that He may come with bounty and promptitude to the aid of His Church , We judge it of deep utility for the Christian people , continually to invoke with_great piety and trust , together_with_the Virgin Mother of God , her chaste Spouse , the Blessed Joseph ; and We regard it as most certain_that this_will be most pleasing to the Virgin herself . On the subject of this_devotion , of which We speak publicly for the first time to day , We know without_doubt that not_only -isaia- the people inclined to it , but_that it -isaia-_already established , and -isaia- advancing to full growth . We have_seen the devotion to St . Joseph , which in past times the Roman Pontiffs have developed and gradually increased , grow into greater proportions in Our time , particularly after Pius IX . , of happy_memory , Our predecessor , proclaimed , yielding to the request of a large number of bishops , this_holy patriarch the patron of the Catholic Church . And as , moreover , it -isaia- of high importance that the devotion to St . Joseph should engraft itself upon the daily pious practices of Catholics , We desire_that the Christian people should be urged to it above all by Our words and authority . The special motives for_which St . Joseph has_been proclaimed Patron of the Church , and from which_the Church looks for singular benefit from his patronage and protection , are that Joseph was_the spouse of Mary and that he was reputed the Father of Jesus Christ . From these sources have sprung his dignity , his_holiness , his glory . In truth , the dignity of the Mother of God -isaia- so lofty that naught created can rank above it . But as Joseph has_been united to the Blessed Virgin by the ties of marriage , it may_not be doubted that he approached nearer than_any to the eminent dignity by which_the Mother of God surpasses so nobly all created natures . For marriage -isaia-_the_most intimate of all unions which from its essence imparts a community of gifts between those_that by it are joined together . Thus in giving Joseph the Blessed Virgin as spouse , God appointed him to be not_only her_life s companion , the witness of her maidenhood , the protector of her honour , but_also , by virtue of the conjugal tie , a participator in her sublime dignity . And Joseph shines among all mankind by the most august dignity , since by divine will , he was_the guardian of the Son of God and reputed as His father among_men . Hence it came about_that the Word of God was humbly subject to Joseph , that He obeyed him , and that He rendered to him all those offices that children are_bound to render to their_parents . From this two fold dignity flowed the obligation which nature lays upon the head of families , so that Joseph became the guardian , the administrator , and the legal defender of the divine house whose chief he was . And during the whole course of his_life he fulfilled those charges and those duties . He set himself to protect with a mighty love and a daily solicitude his spouse and the Divine Infant ; regularly by his_work he earned what_was necessary_for the one and the other for nourishment and clothing ; he guarded from death the Child threatened by a monarch s jealousy , and found for Him a refuge ; in the miseries of the journey and in the bitternesses of exile he was ever the companion , the assistance , and the upholder of the Virgin and of Jesus . Now the divine house which Joseph ruled with the authority of a father , contained within its limits the scarce born Church . From the same fact_that the most_holy Virgin -isaia- the mother of Jesus Christ -isaia- she the mother of all Christians whom she bore on Mount Calvary amid the supreme throes of the Redemption ; Jesus Christ -isaia- , in a manner , the first born of Christians , who by the adoption and Redemption are his_brothers . And for_such reasons the Blessed Patriarch looks upon the multitude of Christians who make up the Church as confided specially to his trust this limitless family spread over the earth , over which , because he -isaia- the spouse of Mary and the Father of Jesus Christ he holds , as it were , a paternal authority . It -isaia- , then , natural and worthy that as the Blessed Joseph ministered to all the needs of the family -atti_degli_apostoli- Nazareth and girt it about with_his protection , he should now cover with the cloak of his heavenly patronage and defend the Church of Jesus Christ . You well understand , Venerable Brethren , that_these considerations are confirmed by the , opinion held by a large number of the Fathers , to which_the sacred_liturgy gives its sanction , that the Joseph of ancient times , son of the patriarch Jacob , was_the type of St . Joseph , and the former by his glory prefigured the greatness of the future guardian of the Holy Family . And in truth , beyond_the fact_that the same name a point the significance of which has_never been denied was_given to each , you well know_the points of likeness that exist between_them ; namely_,_that the first Joseph won the favour and especial goodwill of his master , and that_through Joseph s administration his household came to prosperity and wealth ; that still more_important he presided over the kingdom with_great power , and , in a time_when the harvests failed , he provided for all the needs of the Egyptians with so much wisdom that the King decreed to him the title '' Saviour of the world . '' Thus it -isaia- that We may prefigure the new in the old patriarch . And as the first caused the prosperity of his master s domestic interests and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time rendered great services to the whole kingdom , so the second , destined to be the guardian of the Christian religion , should be regarded as the protector and defender of the Church , which_-isaia- truly the house of the Lord and the kingdom of God on earth . These are the reasons why men of every rank and country should fly to the trust and guard of the blessed Joseph . Fathers of families find in Joseph the best personification of paternal solicitude and vigilance ; spouses a perfect example of love , of peace , and of conjugal fidelity ; virgins -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time find in him the model and protector of virginal integrity . The noble of birth will earn of Joseph how to guard their_dignity even in misfortune ; the rich will understand , by his lessons , what_are the goods most to be desired and won -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of their labour . As to workmen , artisans , and persons of lesser degree , their recourse to Joseph -isaia- a special right , and his example -isaia- for their particular imitation . For Joseph , of royal blood , united by marriage to the greatest and holiest of women , reputed the father of the Son of God , passed his_life in labour , and won by the toil of the artisan the needful support of his family . It -isaia- , then , true_that the condition of the lowly has nothing shameful in it , and the work of the labourer -isaia-_not_only not dishonouring , but can , if virtue be joined to it , be singularly ennobled . Joseph , content with_his slight possessions , bore the trials consequent on a fortune so slender , with greatness of soul , in imitation of his Son , who having put on the form of a slave , being the Lord of life , subjected himself of his_own free will to the spoliation and loss of everything . Through these considerations , the poor and those_who live by the labour of their hands should be of good heart and learn to be just . If they win the right of emerging from poverty and obtaining a better rank by lawful means , reason and justice uphold them in changing the order established , in the first instance , for them by the Providence of God . But recourse to force and struggles by seditious paths to obtain such ends are madnesses which only aggravate the evil which_they aim to suppress . Let the poor , then , if they_would be wise , trust not to the promises of seditious men , but_rather to the example and patronage of the Blessed Joseph , and to the maternal charity of the Church , which_each day takes an increasing compassion on their lot . This -isaia- the reason_why trusting much to your zeal and episcopal authority , Venerable Brethren , and not doubting that the good and pious faithful will run beyond_the mere letter of the law We prescribe that during the whole month of October , -atti_degli_apostoli- the recitation of the Rosary , for_which We have_already legislated , a prayer to St . Joseph be added , the formula of which_will be sent with this_letter , and that_this custom should be repeated every year . To those_who recite this_prayer , We grant for each time an indulgence of seven years and seven Lents . It -isaia- a salutary practice and very praiseworthy , already established in some_countries , to consecrate the month of March to the honour of the holy Patriarch by daily exercises of piety . Where this custom cannot be easily established , it -isaia- as least desirable , that before the feast day , in the principal church of each parish , a triduo of prayer be celebrated . In those lands where_the th of March the Feast of St . Joseph -isaia- not a Festival of Obligation , We exhort the faithful to sanctify it as far_as_possible by private pious practices , in honour of their heavenly patron , as though it were a day of Obligation . And in token of heavenly favours , and in witness of Our good_will , We grant most lovingly in the Lord , to you , Venerable Brethren , to your_clergy and to your_people , the Apostolic blessing . Given from the Vatican , August th , , the th year of Our Pontificate . LEO XIII Prayer to Saint Joseph To thee , O blessed Joseph , we have_recourse in our affliction , and having implored the help of thy thrice holy Spouse , we now , with hearts filled_with confidence , earnestly beg thee also to take us under thy protection . By that charity wherewith thou wert united to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God , and by that fatherly love with_which thou didst cherish the Child Jesus , we beseech thee and we humbly pray that thou wilt look down with gracious eye upon that inheritance which Jesus Christ purchased by His blood , and wilt succor us in our need by thy power and strength . Defend , O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family , the chosen off spring of Jesus Christ . Keep from us , O most loving Father , all blight of error and corruption . Aid us from on high , most valiant defender , in this conflict with the powers of darkness . And even as of old thou didst rescue the Child Jesus from the peril of His life , so now defend God s Holy Church from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity . Shield us ever under thy patronage , that , following thine example and strengthened by thy help , we may live a holy life , die a happy death , and attain to everlasting bliss in Heaven", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Gioacchino Vincenzo Raffaele Luigi Pecci", "author_dob": "02/03/1810", "author_start": "20/02/1878", "author_end": "20/07/1903", "pontificate_years": 25}
