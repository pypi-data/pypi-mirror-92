Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Blessing . We have_already had the opportunity on several occasions during Our Pontificate of bearing public testimony to that confidence and devotion towards_the Blessed Virgin which We imbibed in Our tenderest years , and have endeavoured to cherish and develop all our life long . For , having fallen upon times of calamity for Christendom and perils for the nations , We have realised how prudent it -isaia- to warmly recommend this_means of safe guarding happiness and peace which God has most mercifully granted to Mankind in His August Mother , and which bath ever been celebrated in the annals of the Church . The manifold zeal of Christian people has responded to Our desires and exhortations , most particularly in exciting a devotion to the Rosary ; and a plentiful harvest of excellent fruits has not_been wanting . Still we can_never be satisfied with celebrating the Divine Mother , who_-isaia- in truth worthy of all praise , and in urging love and affection towards her who -isaia-_also the mother of mankind , who_-isaia- full of mercy , full of grace . Yea , Our soul , wearied with the cares of the Apostolate , the nearer it feels the time of Our departure to be -atti_degli_apostoli- hand , with the more earnest confidence looks up to her from whom , as from a blessed dawn , arose the Day of happiness and joy that_was never to set . It -isaia- pleasant to us to remember , Venerable Brethren , that We have in other letters issued from time to time extolled the devotion of the Rosary ; for it -isaia- in many_ways most pleasing to her in whose honour it -isaia- employed , and most advantageous to those_who properly use it . But it -isaia- equally pleasant to be able now to insist upon and confirm the same fact . Herein we have an excellent opportunity to paternally exhort men s minds and hearts to an increase of religion , and to stimulate within them the hope of eternal reward . The form of prayer We refer to has obtained the special name of '' Rosary , '' as though it represented by its arrangement the sweetness of roses and the charm of a garland . This -isaia- most fitting for a method of venerating the Virgin , who_-isaia- rightly styled the Mystical Rose of Paradise , and who , as Queen of the universe , shines therein with a crown of stars . So that by its_very name it appears to foreshadow and be an augury of the joys and garlands of Heaven offered by her to those_who_are devoted to her . This appears Clearly if we consider_the nature of the Rosary of Our Lady . There -isaia- no duty which Christ and His Apostles more emphatically urged by both precept and example than_that of prayer and supplication to Almighty God . The Fathers and Doctors in subsequent times have taught that_this_-isaia- a matter of such grave necessity , that if men neglect it they hope in vain for eternal_salvation . Every one_who prays finds the door open to impetration , both from the very nature of prayer and from the promises of Christ . And we all know_that prayer derives its chief efficacy from two principal circumstances : perseverance , and the union of many for one end . The former -isaia- signified in those invitations of Christ so full of goodness : ask , seek , knock Matt . , , just as a kind father desires to indulge the wishes of his_children , but who also requires to be continually asked by them and as it were wearied by their prayers , in order to attach their_hearts more_closely to himself . The second condition Our Lord has born witness to more_than_once : If two of you shall consent upon earth concerning anything whatsoever they_shall ask , it shall be done to them by My Father who_-isaia- in heaven . For where_there are two or three gathered in My name , there -amos- I in the midst of them Matt . Hence that pregnant saying of Tertullian : Let us gather into an assembly and congregation that_we_may , as it were , make up a band and solicit God Apologet . xxxix : such violence -isaia- pleasing to God ; and the memorable words of Aquinas : It -isaia- impossible that the prayers of many should_not be heard , if one prayer_-isaia- made up as it were out of many supplications . Both of these qualities are conspicuous in the Rosary . For , to be brief , by repeating the same prayers we strenuously implore from Our Heavenly Father the Kingdom of His grace and glory ; we again_and_again beseech the Virgin Mother to aid us sinners by her prayers , both during our whole_life and especially -atti_degli_apostoli- that last moment which_-isaia- the stepping stone to eternity . The formula of the Rosary , too , -isaia- excellently adapted to prayer in common , so that it has_been styled , not_without reason , '' The Psalter of Mary . '' And that old custom of our forefathers ought to be preserved or else restored , according to which Christian families , whether in town or country , were religiously wont -atti_degli_apostoli- close of day , when their labours were -atti_degli_apostoli- an end , to assemble before a figure of Our Lady and alternatelyrecite the Rosary . She , delighted -atti_degli_apostoli- this faithful and unanimous homage , wasever near them like a loving mother surrounded by her_children , distributing tothem the blessings of domestic peace , the foretaste of the peace of heaven . Considering the efficacy of public prayer , We , among_other decrees which we havefrom time to time issued concerning the Rosary , have spoken thus : '' It isOur desire_that in the principal church of each diocese it should be recitedevery day , and in parish churches on every feast day Apostolic Letter Salutaris Ille , th December , . Let this be constantly and devoutly carried_out . Wealso see with_joy the custom extended on other solemn occasions of publicdevotion and in pilgrimages to venerated shrines , the growing frequency of whichis to be commended . This association of prayer and praise to Mary -isaia- bothdelightful and salutary for souls . We ourselves have most strongly experiencedthis and Our heart rejoices to recall it when -atti_degli_apostoli- certain times in OurPontificate We have_been present in the Vatican basilica , surrounded by greatcrowds of all classes , who united with Us in mind , voice , and hope , earnestlyinvoked by the mysteries and prayers of the Rosary , her who -isaia-_the_most powerfulpatroness of the Catholic name . Christ the one Mediator : Position of the Saints and Especially of Mary . And who could think or say that the confidence so strongly felt in thepatronage and protection of the Blessed Virgin -isaia- excessive ? Undoubtedly thename and attributes of the absolute Mediator belong to no other_than to Christ , for being one person , and yet both man and God , He restored the human_race tothe favour of the Heavenly Father : One Mediator of God and men , the man ChristJesus , who gave Himself a redemption for all Tim . And yet , as theAngelic Doctor teaches , there_-isaia- no reason_why certain others should_not becalled in a certain way mediators between God and man , that_-isaia- to say , in so faras they co operate by predisposing and ministering in the union of man with God Summa , p . Such are the angels and saints , theprophets and priests of both Testaments ; but especially has the Blessed Virgin aclaim to the glory of this title . For no single individual can even be imaginedwho has_ever contributed or ever will contribute so much towards reconciling manwith God . She offered to mankind , hastening to eternal ruin , a Saviour , -atti_degli_apostoli- that moment when_she received_the announcement of the mystery of peace brought to this earth by the Angel , with_that admirable act of consent in the name of the whole_human_race Summa . She it -isaia- from whom -isaia- born Jesus ; she_-isaia- therefore truly His mother , and for this_reason a worthy and acceptable '' Mediatrix to the Mediator . '' As the various mysteries present themselves one after_the other in the formula of the Rosary for the meditation and contemplation of men s minds , they_also elucidate what we owe to Mary for our reconciliation and salvation . No one_can fail to be sweetly affected when considering her who appeared in the house of Elizabeth as the minister of the divine gifts , and who presented her Son to the Shepherds , to the kings , and to Simeon . Moreover , one_must remember_that the Blood of Christ shed for our sake and those members in which He offers to His Father the wounds He received , the price of our liberty , are no other_than the flesh and blood of the virgin , since_the flesh of Jesus -isaia- the flesh of Mary , and however much it was exalted in the glory of His resurrection , nevertheless the nature of His flesh derived_from Mary remained and still remains the same de Assumpt . , among the Opera S . Divine Faith and the Rosary . Yet another excellent fruit follows from the Rosary , exceedingly opportune to the character of our_times . This we have referred to elsewhere . It -isaia- that , whilst the virtue of Divine Faith -isaia- daily exposed to so many dangers and attacks , the Christian may here derive nourishment and strength for his faith . Holy writ calls Christ the Author and finisher of faith Heb . , the Author , because He taught men many things_which they_had to believe , especially about Himself in whim dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead Colos . , , and also_because He mercifully gives the power of believing by the grace and , as it were , the function of the Holy Ghost ; the Finisher , because in Heaven , where He will change the habit of faith into the splendour of glory , He openly discloses to them those_things which_they_have seen in this mortal life as through a veil . Now Christ stands forth clearly in the Rosary . We behold in meditation His life , whether His hidden life in joy , or His public_life in excessive toil and sufferings unto death , or His glorious life from His triumphant resurrection to His eternal enthronement -atti_degli_apostoli- the right hand of the Father . And since faith , to befull and sufficient , must display itself , for with the heart we believe untojustice , but_with the mouth confession -isaia- made unto salvation Rom . , , sohave we also in the Rosary an excellent means unto this , for by those vocalprayers with which_it_-isaia- intermingled , we are enabled to express and profess ourfaith in God , our most watchful Father ; in the future life , the forgiveness ofsins ; in the mysteries of the august Trinity , the Incarnation of the Word , theDivine Maternity , and others . All know_the value and merit of faith . For faithis just like a most_precious gem , producing now the blossoms of all virtue bywhich we are pleasing to God , and hereafter to bring forth fruits that_will lastfor ever : for to know Thee -isaia- perfect justice , and to know Thy justice and Thypower -isaia- the root of immortality Wisdom xv . It -isaia- here_the place to add aremark respecting the duties of those virtues which faith rightly postulates . Among them -isaia- the virtue of penance , and one part of this_-isaia- abstinence , whichfor more reasons than one_-isaia- necessary and salutary . It -isaia- true the Church isgrowing more indulgent towards her_children in this_matter , but_they mustunderstand they are_bound to take all care to make up for_this maternalindulgence by other good_works . We rejoice for this_reason also to proposeparticularly the use of the rosary , which_-isaia- capable of producing worthy fruitsof penance , especially by the remembrance of the sufferings of Christ and HisMother . To those therefore who_are striving after supreme happiness this_means of the Rosary has_been most providentially offered , and it -isaia- one unsurpassed for facility and convenience . For any person even moderately instructed in his religion can_make use of it with fruit , and the time it occupies cannot delay any man s business . Sacred history abounds with striking and evident examples . It -isaia- well_known that_there have_been many persons occupied in most weighty functions or absorbed in laborious cares who have_never omitted for a single day this pious practice . Combined with this advantage -isaia- that inward sentiment of devotion which attracts minds to the Rosary , so that_they love it as the intimate companion and faithful protector of life ; and in their last agony they embrace and hold fast to it as the dear pledge of the unfading Crown of glory . Such a pledge -isaia- greatly enhanced by the benefits of sacred indulgences , if properly employed ; for the devotion of the Rosary has_been richly endowed_with such indulgences by both ourPredecessors and Ourselves . These favours will certainly prove most efficaciousto both the dying and the departed , being bestowed as it were by the hands ofthe merciful Virgin , in order that_they_may the sooner enjoy_the eternal peaceand light they_have desired . Prayer for the Re Union of Christendom . These considerations , Venerable Brethren , move us incessantly to extol andrecommend to Catholic peoples this excellent and most salutary form of devotion . Yet another very urgent reason , of which_we_have often spoken both in Lettersand Allocutions , encourages us to do this . For that earnest desire , which Wehave learnt from the Divine Heart of Jesus , of fostering the work ofreconciliation among those_who_are separated_from Us daily urges Us morepressingly to action ; and we are convinced_that this_most excellent Re unioncannot be better prepared and strengthened than by the power of prayer . Theexample of Christ -isaia- before us , for in order_that His disciples might be one infaith and charity , he poured forth prayer and supplication to His Father . Andconcerning the efficacious prayer of His most_holy Mother for the same end , there_-isaia- a striking testimony in the Acts of the Apostles . Therein -isaia- describedthe first assembly of the Disciples , expecting with earnest hope and prayer thepromised fullness of the Holy Spirit . And the presence of Mary united with themin prayer_-isaia- specially indicated : All these were persevering with one mind inprayer with Mary the Mother of Jesus Acts i . Wherefore as the nascentchurchrightly joined itself in prayer with_her as the patroness and most excellent custodian of Unity , so in these times -isaia- it most opportune to do the same all over the Catholic World , particularly during the whole month of October , which_we_have long ago decreed to be dedicated and consecrated , by the solemn devotion of the Rosary , to the Divine Mother , in order to implore her for the afflicted Church . Let then the zeal for this_prayer everywhere be re kindled , particularly for the end of Holy Unity . Nothing will be more agreeable and acceptable to Mary ; for , as she_-isaia- most closely united with Christ she especially wishes and desires that_they who have_received the same Baptism with Him may be united with Him and with one_another in the same faith and perfect charity . So may the sublime mysteries of this_same faith by means of the Rosary devotion be more_deeply impressed in men s minds , with the happy result that '' we may imitate what_they contain and obtain what_they promise . Meanwhile , as a pledge of the Divine Favours and Our affection , We mostlovingly impart to You , your_clergy and People , the Apostolic Benediction . Peter s in Rome , September , , in the th year of Our Pontificate .
