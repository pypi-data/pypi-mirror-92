The enemy forces , inspired by the evil spirit , ever wage war on the Christian name . They join forces in this endeavor with certain groups of men whose purpose -isaia- to subvert divinely revealed truths and to rend the very fabric of Christian society with disastrous dissent . Indeed , how_much damage these cohorts , as it were , have inflicted on the Church -isaia- well_known . And yet , the spirit of all previous groups hostile to Catholic institutions has come to life again in that group called the Masonic sect , which , strong in manpower and resources , -isaia- the leader in a war against anything sacred . Condemnation of Masonic Sect . Our predecessors in the Roman pontificate have in the course of a century and a half outlawed this group not once , but repeatedly . We too , in accordance_with Our duty , have condemned it strongly to Christian people , so that they_might beware of its wiles and bravely repel its impious assaults . Moreover , lest cowardice and sloth overtake us imperceptively , We have deliberately endeavored to reveal the secrets of this pernicious sect and the means by which it labors for the destruction of the Catholic enterprise . Now , though , a certain thoughtless indifference on the part of many Italians has resulted in their not recognizing the magnitude and extent of the peril . And so the faith of our ancestors , the salvation won for mankind by Jesus Christ , and , consequently the great benefits of Christian civilization are endangered . Indeed , fearing nothing and yielding to no one , the Masonic sect proceeds with_greater boldness day_by_day : with its poisonous infection it pervades entire communities and strives to entangle itself in all the institutions of our country in its conspiracy to forcefully deprive the Italian people of their Catholic faith , the origin and source of their greatest blessings . This -isaia- the reason_for the endless artifices they employ in their assault on the divinely inspired faith ; this_-isaia- the reason_why the legitimate liberty of the Church -isaia- treated with contempt and beset with legal oppression . They believe_that the Church does_not possess the nature and essence of a true society , that the State has priority over it , and that civil authority takes precedence over sacred authority . This false and destructive doctrine has_been frequently condemned by the Holy See . Among many_other ills , it has_been responsible_for the usurpation on the part of civil authorities of that to which_they_have no right and for their unscrupulous appropriation of what they_have alienated from the Church . This -isaia- clear in the case of ecclesiastical benefices ; they usurp the right to give or withhold the revenues of these according_to_their good pleasure . Clergy Have Been Underestimated . Likewise , in a manner no less insidious , they plan to soften the opposition of the lower clergy with_their promises . Their purpose in this endeavor can easily be detected , especially since_the very authors of this undertaking do not take sufficient pains to conceal what_they intend . They wish to win over the clergy by cajolery ; once the novelties have confused them , they_will withdraw their obedience to legitimate authority . And yet in this_matter they seem to have underestimated the virtue of our clergy , who for so many years have_given manifest examples of their moderation and loyalty . We have every reason to be confident that , with God s help , they will_continue their devotion to duty no matter what circumstances may arise . Those Already Misled . This summary indicates both the extent of the activity of the Masonic sect and the goal of its endeavors . What compounds this harmful situation , however , and causes Us deep anxiety -isaia- that far too many of our compatriots , driven by hope of their_personal advantage or by perverse ambition , have_given their names or support to the sect . This being so , We commend first_and_foremost to your efforts the eternal_salvation of those_whom we have just mentioned : may your zeal never waver in constantly and insistently recalling them_from their error and certain destruction . To be sure , the task of extricating those_who_have fallen into the snares of the Masons -isaia- laborious , and its outcome -isaia- doubtful , if we consider_the cleverness of the sect : still the recovery of no one_should ever be despaired of since_the force of apostolic charity_-isaia- truly marvellous . Next , we must heal those_who_have erred in this respect out of faint heartedness , that_-isaia- , those_who , not because of a debased nature but because of weakness of spirit and lack of discretion , have allowed themselves to be drawn into supporting the Masonic enterprises . Sufficiently weighty are the words of Our predecessor Felix III in this_regard . '' An error which_-isaia-_not resisted -isaia- approved ; a truth which_-isaia-_not defended -isaia- suppressed . He who_does_not oppose an evident crime -isaia- open to the suspicion of secret complicity . '' By reminding them of the examples of their forefathers , the broken spirits of these_men must be reanimated with_that courage which_-isaia- the guardian of duty and dignity alike , so that_they_may be ashamed and regret their cowardly actions . For surely our whole life_-isaia- involved in a constant battle in which our_salvation itself_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake ; nothing_-isaia- more disgraceful for a Christian than cowardice . It -isaia- likewise necessary to strengthen those_who fall because of ignorance . By this we mean those , not few in number , who , deceived by appearances and allured by various enticements , allow themselves without understanding it to be enrolled in the Masonic order . In these cases We hope_that with divine inspiration they will_be_able some day to repudiate their error and perceive the truth , especially if you try to remove the false outward appearance of the sect and reveal its hidden designs . Indeed these can no longer be considered hidden since their_very accomplices have themselves disclosed them in many_ways . Why , within_the last few months , the designs of the Masons have_been publicly proclaimed throughout Italy , even to the point of ostentation ! They wish to see the religion founded by God reudiated and all affairs , private as well as public , regulated by the principles of naturalism alone ; this_-isaia-_what , in their impiety and stupidity , they call the restoration of civil_society . And yet the State will plunge headlong into ruin if Christians are_not willing to be vigilant and not willing to labor to support its well_being ! Course o f Action . But in the presence of such audacious evils , it -isaia- not sufficient merely to be aware of the wiles of this vile sect : we must_also war against it , using those very arms furnished by the divine faith_which once prevailed against paganism . Therefore , it -isaia- your task to inflame souls by persuasion , exhortation and example ; nourish in the clergy and our people a zeal for religion and salvation which_-isaia- active , resolute , and intrepid . These qualities frequently distinguish Catholic peoples of other nations in similar situations . It -isaia- commonly claimed that the ancient ardor of spirit in protecting their ancestral faith_has grown cold among the Italian people . Nor -isaia- this perhaps false ; especially since if the dispositions of both sides be inspected , those_who wage war on religion seem to show more energy than those_who repel it . But for those_who seek salvation there_can be no middle ground between laborious struggle and destruction . Therefore , in the case of the weak and sluggish , courage must be stirred up through your efforts ; in the case of the strong , it must be kept active ; with all trace of dissent wiped out , under your leadership and command , the result will be that all alike , with united minds and common discipline , may undertake the battle in a spirited manner . Because of the gravity of the matter and the necessity of repelling the danger , We have decided to address the Italian people in a letter which We are including along_with this one ; propagate it as widely as possible and , where needed , interpret it to your_people . In this manner , with the blessing of God , we can hope_that spirits may be aroused through the contemplation of the threatening evils and betake themselves without delay to the remedies which We have pointed_out . As a presage of divine gifts and testimony of Our benevolence We affectionately accord to you , Venerable Brethren , and the people entrusted_to_your care , the apostolic_blessing .
