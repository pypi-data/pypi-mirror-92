Venerable Brethren , Greeting and Apostolic Benediction . The sacred joy which it has_been_given to Us to feel in attaining the fiftieth anniversary of Our Episcopal Consecration has_been deepened by the knowledge that_it_was shared by the people of the whole Catholic world , and that as a father in the midst of his_children We have_been consoled by the touching testimonies of their loyalty and love . We gratefully accept it and record it as a fresh proof of God s special providence , and one which_-isaia- markedly full of bounty to Ourselves , and of blessing to the Church . At the same_time We love to offer Our thanks for_this signal benefit to the august Mother of God , whose powerful intercession We feel to have_been exercised in Our behalf . For hers -isaia- the loving kindness which , during the length of years and the vicissitudes of life , has_never failed Us , and which day_by_day seems to draw nearer to Us than_ever , filling Our soul with gladness , and strengthening Us with a confidence of which_the surety -isaia- higher than the things of time . It -isaia- as if the voice of the heavenly Queen made itself heard to Us , -atti_degli_apostoli- one moment graciously consoling Us in the midst of trials ; -atti_degli_apostoli- another guiding Us by her counsel in directing the great work of the salvation_of_souls ; -atti_degli_apostoli- another , urging Us to admonish the Christian people to advance in piety and in the practice of every virtue . For Us it -isaia- once_more a joy as well as a duty to respond to her inspirations . Amongst the happy results which have_already rewarded Our exhortations which_were due to her prompting , We have to reckon the remarkable impulse given to the Devotion of the Most Holy Rosary . This awakening has made itself felt in the increased number of Confraternities instituted for the purpose , the voluminous literature of pious and learned works written upon the subject , and the manifold tributes which Christian art has not failed to bring to its service . And now , as if for yet another time , listening to the voice of the same zealous Mother , who calls upon Us to '' cry out and cease not , '' We rejoice once_more to address you , Venerable Brethren , upon the subject of the Rosary , standing as We do upon the eve of that month of October which , by the award of special Indulgences , We have deemed it well to dedicate to this_most popular devotion . Our appeal to you , however , will_not be directed so much to add any further recommendation of a method of prayer so praiseworthy in itself , nor yet to press upon the faithful the necessity of practising it still_more fervently , but_rather to point_out how we may draw from this_devotion certain advantages which_are especially valuable and needful -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day . The Rosary and Society . For We are convinced_that the Rosary , if devoutly used , -isaia- bound to benefit not_only the individual but society -atti_degli_apostoli- large . No one will do Us the injustice to deny that in the discharge of the duties of the Supreme Apostolate We have laboured as , God helping , We shall ever continue to labour to promote the civil prosperity of mankind . Repeatedly have We admonished those_who_are invested with sovereign power that_they_should neither make nor execute laws except in conformity_with_the equity of the Divine mind . On the other_hand , we have constantly besought citizens who_were conspicuous by genius , industry , family , or fortune , to join together in common counsel and action to safeguard and to promote whatever would tend to the strength and well_being of the community . Only too many causes are_-atti_degli_apostoli- work , in the present condition of things , to loosen the bonds of public order , and to withdraw the people from sound principles of life and conduct . Dislike of Poverty The Joyful Mysteries . There are three influences which appear to Us to have_the chief place in effecting this downgrade movement of society . These are first , the distaste for a simple and labourious life ; secondly , repugnance to suffering of any_kind ; thirdly , the forgetfulness of the future life . We deplore and those_who judge of all things merely by the light and according to the standard of nature join with Us in deploring that society_-isaia- threatened with a serious danger in the growing contempt of those homely duties and virtues which_make up the beauty of humble life . To this cause we may trace in the home , the readiness of children to withdraw themselves from the natural obligation of obedience to the parents , and their impatience of any form of treatment which_-isaia-_not of the indulgent and effeminate kind . In the workman , it evinces itself in a tendency to desert his trade , to shrink from toil , to become discontented with_his lot , to fix his gaze on things_that_are above him , and to look forward with unthinking hopefulness to some future equalization of property . We may observe the same temper permeating the masses in the eagerness to exchange the life of the rural districts for the excitements and pleasures of the town . Thus the equilibrium between_the classes of the community -isaia- being destroyed , everything becomes unsettled , men s minds become a prey to jealousy and heart burnings , rights are openly trampled under foot , and , finally , the people , betrayed in their expectations , attack public order , and place themselves in conflict with_those_who are charged to maintain it . For evils such as these let us seek a remedy in the Rosary , which consists in a fixed order of prayer combined with devout meditation on the life of Christ and His Blessed Mother . Here , if the joyful mysteries be but clearly brought home to the minds of the people , an object lesson of the chief virtues -isaia- placed before their_eyes . Each one will thus be able to see for_himself how easy , how abundant , how sweetly attractive are the lessons to be found therein for the leading of an honest life . Let us take our stand in front of that earthly and divine home of holiness , the House of Nazareth . How much we have to learn from the daily_life which_was led within its walls ! What an all perfect model of domestic society ! Here we behold simplicity and purity of conduct , perfect agreement and unbroken harmony , mutual respect and love not of the false and fleeting kind but that_which finds both its life and its charm in devotedness of service . Here -isaia- the patient industry which provides what_-isaia- required_for food and raiment ; which_does so '' in the sweat of the brow , '' which_-isaia- contented with little , and which seeks rather to diminish the number of its wants than to multiply the sources of its wealth . Better than all , we find there that supreme peace of mind and gladness of soul which never fail to accompany the possession of a tranquil conscience . These are precious examples of goodness , of modesty , of humility , of hard working endurance , of kindness to others , of diligence in the small duties of daily_life , and of other virtues , and once they have_made their influence felt they gradually take root in the soul , and in course of time fail not to bring_about a happy change of mind and conduct . Then will each_one begin to feel his_work to be no longer lowly and irksome , but grateful and lightsome , and clothed with a certain joyousness by his sense of duty in discharging it conscientiously . Then will gentler manners everywhere prevail ; home life will be loved and esteemed , and the relations of man with_man will be loved and esteemed , and the relations of man with_man will be hallowed by a larger infusion of respect and charity . And if this betterment should go forth_from the individual to the family and to the communities , and thence to the people -atti_degli_apostoli- large so that human_life should be lifted up to this standard , no one will fail to feel how_great and lasting indeed would be the gain which_would be achieved for society . Repugnance to Suffering The Sorrowful Mysteries . A second evil , one which_-isaia- specially pernicious , and one_which , owing to the increasing mischief which it works among souls , we can_never sufficiently deplore , -isaia- to be found in repugnance to suffering and eagerness to escape whatever_-isaia- hard or painful to endure . The greater number are thus robbed of that peace and freedom of mind which remains the reward of those_who do what_-isaia- right undismayed by the perils or troubles to be met with in doing so . Rather do they dream of a chimeric civilization in which all that_-isaia- unpleasant shall be removed , and all that_-isaia- pleasant shall be supplied . By this passionate and unbridled desire of living a life of pleasure , the minds_of_men are weakened , and if they_do_not entirely succumb , they become demoralized and miserably cower and sink under the hardships of the battle of life . In such a contest example -isaia- everything , and a powerful means of renewing our courage will undoubtedly be found in the Holy Rosary , if from our earliest years our minds have_been trained to dwell upon the sorrowful mysteries of Our Lord s life , and to drink in their meaning by sweet and silent meditation . In them we shall learn how Christ , '' the Author and Finisher of Our faith , '' began '' to do and teach , '' in order_that we might see written in His example all the lessons that He Himself had taught us for the bearing of our burden of labour and sorrow , and mark how the sufferings which_were hardest to bear were those_which He embraced with the greatest measure of generosity and good_will . We behold Him overwhelmed with sadness , so that drops of blood ooze like sweat from His veins . We see Him bound like a malefactor , subjected to the judgment of the unrighteous , laden with insults , covered with shame , assailed with false accusations , torn with scourges , crowned with thorns , nailed to the cross , accounted unworthy to live , and condemned by the voice of the multitude as deserving of death . Here , too , we contemplate the grief of the most Holy Mother , whose soul was_not merely wounded but '' pierced '' by the sword of sorrow , so that_she might be named and become in truth '' the Mother of Sorrows . '' Witnessing these examples of fortitude , not_with sight but by faith , who_-isaia- there who_will not feel his_heart grow warm with the desire of imitating them ? . Then , be it that the '' earth -isaia- accursed '' and brings forth '' thistles and thorns , '' be it that the soul -isaia- saddened with grief and the body with sickness ; even so , there_will be no evil which_the envy of man or the rage of devils can invent , nor calamity which_can fall upon the individual or the community , over which we shall_not triumph by the patience of suffering . For this_reason it has_been truly said_that '' it belongs to the Christian to do and to endure great things , '' for he who deserves to be called a Christian must_not shrink from following in the footsteps of Christ . But by this patience , We do not mean_that empty stoicism in the enduring of pain which_was the ideal of some of the philosophers of old , but_rather do We mean_that patience which_-isaia- learned from the example of Him , who '' having joy set before Him , endured the cross , despising the shame '' Heb . It -isaia- the patience which_-isaia- obtained by the help of His grace ; which shirks not a trial because_it_-isaia- painful , but_which accepts it and esteems it as a gain , however hard it may be to undergo . The Catholic Church has_always had , and happily still has , multitudes of men_and_women , in every rank and condition of life , who_are glorious disciples of this_teaching , and who , following faithfully in the path of Christ , suffer injury and hardship for the cause of virtue and religion . They re echo , not with_their lips , but_with their_life , the words of St . Thomas : '' Let us also go , that_we_may die with_him '' John xi . May such types of admirable constancy be more_and_more splendidly multiplied in our midst to the weal of society and to the glory and edification of the Church of God ! Forgetfulness of the Future The Glorious Mysteries . The third evil for_which a remedy -isaia- needed -isaia- one which_-isaia- chiefly characteristic of the times in which we live . Men in former ages , although they loved the world , and loved it far too well , did_not usually aggravate their sinful attachment to the things of earth by a contempt of the things of heaven . Even the right thinking portion of the pagan world recognized that_this life was_not a home but a dwelling place , not our destination , but a stage in the journey . But men of our_day , albeit they_have had the advantages of Christian instruction , pursue the false goods of this_world in such wise that the thought of their true Fatherland of enduring happiness -isaia-_not_only set_aside , but , to their shame be it said , banished and entirely erased from their memory , notwithstanding the warning of St . Paul , '' We have_not here a lasting city , but we seek one which_-isaia- to come '' Heb . When We seek out the causes of this forgetfulness , We are met in the first_place by the fact_that many allow themselves to believe_that the thought of a future life goes in some_way to -sapienza- the love of our country , and thus militates against the prosperity of the commonwealth . No illusion could be more foolish or hateful . Our future hope -isaia- not of a kind which so monopolizes the minds_of_men as to withdraw their attention from the interests of this_life . Christ commands us , it -isaia- true , to seek the Kingdom of God , and in the first_place , but_not in such a manner as to neglect all things else . For , the use of the goods of the present life , and the righteous enjoyment which_they furnish , may serve both to strengthen virtue and to reward it . The splendour and beauty of our earthly habitation , by which human society_-isaia- ennobled , may mirror the splendour and beauty of our dwelling which_-isaia- above . Therein we see nothing that_-isaia-_not worthy of the reason of man and of the wisdom of God . For the same God who_-isaia- the Author of Nature -isaia- the Author of Grace , and He willed not_that one_should collide or conflict with the other , but that_they_should act in friendly alliance , so that under the leadership of both we may the more_easily arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- that immortal happiness for_which we mortal men were created . But men of carnal mind , who love nothing but themselves , allow their thoughts to grovel upon things of earth until they_are unable to lift them to that_which_-isaia- higher . For , far from using the goods of time as a help towards securing those_which are eternal , they lose sight altogether of the world which_-isaia- to come , and sink to the lowest depths of degradation . We may doubt if God could inflict upon man a more terrible punishment than to allow him to waste his whole_life in the pursuit of earthly pleasures , and in forgetfulness of the happiness which alone lasts for ever . It -isaia- from this danger that_they_will be happily rescued , who , in the pious practice of the Rosary , are wont , by frequent and fervent prayer , to keep before their_minds the glorious mysteries . These mysteries are the means by which in the soul of a Christian a most clear light -isaia- shed upon the good things , hidden to sense , but visible to faith , '' which God has prepared_for those_who love Him . '' From them we learn that death -isaia- not an annihilation which ends all things , but merely a migration and passage from life to life . By them we are taught that the path to Heaven lies open to all men , and as we behold Christ ascending thither , we recall_the sweet words of His promise , '' I go to prepare a place_for you . '' By them we are reminded that a time will come when '' God will wipe away every tear from our_eyes , '' and that '' neither mourning , nor crying , nor sorrow , shall be any more , '' and that '' We shall be always with the Lord , '' and '' like to the Lord , for we shall see Him as He -isaia- , '' and '' drink of the torrent of His delight , '' as '' fellow citizens of the saints , '' in the blessed companionship of our glorious Queen and Mother . Dwelling upon such a prospect , our_hearts are kindled with desire , and we exclaim , in the words of a great saint , '' How vile grows the earth when I look up to heaven ! '' Then , too , shall we feel the solace of the assurance '' that_which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- present momentary and light of our tribulation worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory '' Cor . Here alone we discover the true relation between time and eternity , between our life on earth and our life in heaven ; and it -isaia- thus alone that_are formed strong and noble characters . When such characters can be counted in large numbers , the dignity and well_being of society are assured . All that_-isaia- beautiful , good , and true will flourish in the measure of its conformity to Him who_-isaia- of all beauty , goodness , and truth the first Principle and the Eternal Source . Confraternities of the Rosary . These considerations will explain what We have_already laid_down concerning the fruitful advantages which_are to be derived_from the use of the Rosary , and the healing power which this_devotion possesses for the evils of the age and the fatal sores of society . These advantages , as we may readily conceive , will be secured in a higher and fuller measure by those_who band themselves together in the sacred Confraternity of the Rosary , and who_are thus more_than others united by a special and brotherly bond of devotion to the Most Holy Virgin . In this Confraternity , approved by the Roman Pontiffs , and enriched by them_with indulgences and privileges , they possess their_own rule and government , hold their meetings -atti_degli_apostoli- stated times , and are provided with ample means of leading a holy life and of labouring for the good of the community . They are , are so to speak , the battalions who fight the battle of Christ , armed with His Sacred Mysteries , and under the banner and guidance of the Heavenly queen . How faithfully her intercession -isaia- exercised in response to their prayers , processions , and solemnities -isaia- written in the whole experience of the Church not less_than in the splendour of the victory of Lepanto . It -isaia- , therefore , to be desired that renewed zeal should be called forth in the founding , enlarging , and directing of these confraternities , and that not_only by the sons of St . Dominic , to whom by virtue of their Order a leading part in this Apostolate belongs , but by all who_are charged with the care of souls , and notable in those places in which_the Confraternity has not_yet been canonically established . We have it especially -atti_degli_apostoli- heart that_those_who are engaged in the sacred field of the missions , whether in carrying the Gospel to barbarous nations abroad , or in spreading it amongst the Christian nations -atti_degli_apostoli- home , should look upon this_work as especially their_own . If they_will make it the subject of their preaching , We cannot doubt_that there_will be large numbers of the faithful of Christ who_will readily enrol themselves in the Confraternity , and who_will earnestly endeavour to avail themselves of those spiritual advantages of which We have spoken , and in which consist the very meaning and motive of the Rosary . From the Confraternities , the rest of the faithful will receive the example of greater esteem and reverence for the practice of the Rosary , and they_will be thus encouraged to reap from it , as We heartily desire that_they_may , the same abundant fruits for their_souls salvation . This then -isaia- the hope , which , amid the manifold evils which beset society , brightens , consoles , and supports Us . May Mary , the Mother of God and of men , herself the authoress and teacher of the Rosary , procure for Us its happyfulfilment . It will be your part , Venerable Brethren , to provide that by yourefforts Our words and Our wishes may go forth on their_mission of good for theprosperity of families and the peace of peoples . And as a pledge of the Divine favour , and of Our own affection , We lovingly bestow upon you , your_clergy , and your_people , the Apostolic Benediction .
