The grave discussions on economical questions which for same_time past have disturbed the peace of several countries of the world are growing in frequency and intensity to such a degree that the minds of thoughtful men_are filled , and rightly so , with worry and alarm . These discussions take their rise in the bad philosophical and ethical teaching which_-isaia- now widespread among the people . The changes , also , which_the mechanical inventions of the age have introduced , the rapidity of communication between places , and the devices of every_kind for diminishing labor and increasing gain , all add bitterness to the strife ; and , lastly , matters have_been brought to such a pass by the struggle between capital and labor , fomented as it -isaia- by professional agitators , that the countries where these disturbances most frequently occur find_themselves confronted with ruin and disaster . At the very_beginning of Our pontificate We clearly pointed_out what_the peril was which confronted society on this head , and We deemed it Our duty to warn Catholics , in unmistakable language , how_great the error was which_was lurking in the utterances of socialism , and how_great the danger was that threatened not_only their temporal possessions , but_also their morality and religion . That was_the purpose of Our encyclical_letter Quod Apostolici Muneris which We published on the th of December in the year ; but , as these dangers day_by_day threatened still greater disaster , both to individuals and the commonwealth , We strove with all the more energy to avert them . This was_the object of Our encyclical Rerum Novarum of the th of May , , in which we dwelt -atti_degli_apostoli- length on the rights_and_duties which both classes of society those namely , who control capital , and those_who contribute labor are_bound in relation to each_other ; and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , We made it evident_that the remedies which_are most useful to protect the cause of religion , and to terminate the contest between_the different classes of society , were to be found in the precepts of the Gospel . Nor , with God s grace , were Our hopes entirely frustrated . Even those_who_are not Catholics , moved by the power of truth , avowed that the Church must be credited with a watchful care over all classes of society , and especially_those whom fortune had least favored . Catholics , of course , profited abundantly by these letters , for they not_only received encouragement and strength for the excellent undertakings in which_they were engaged , but_also obtained the light_which they needed in order to study this order of problems with_great sureness and success . Hence it happened that the differences of opinion which prevailed among_them were either removed or lessened . In the order of action , much has_been done in favor of the proletariat , especially in those places_where poverty was -atti_degli_apostoli- its worst . Many new institutions were set on foot , those_which were already established were increased , and all reaped the benefit of a greater stability . Such are , for instance , the popular bureaus which supply information to the uneducated ; the rural banks which_make loans to small farmers ; the societies for mutual help or relief ; the unions of working men and other associations or institutions of the same kind . Thus , under the auspices of the Church , a measure of united action among Catholics was secured , as well as some planning in the setting up of agencies for the protection of the masses which , in fact , are as often oppressed by guile and exploitation of their necessities as by their_own indigence and toil . This work of popular aid had , -atti_degli_apostoli- first , no name of its_own . The name of Christian Socialism , with its derivatives , which_was adopted by some was very properly allowed to fall_into disuse . Afterwards , some asked to have it called the popular Christian Movement . In the countries most concerned_with this_matter , there_are_some who_are known as Social Christians . Elsewhere , the movement -isaia- described as Christian Democracy and its partisans as Christian Democrats , in opposition to what_the socialists call Social Democracy . Not much exception -isaia- taken to the first of these_two names , i . , Social Christians , but many excellent men find the term Christian Democracy objectionable . They hold it to be very ambiguous and for this_reason open to two objections . It seems by implication covertly to favor popular government and to disparage other methods of political administration . Secondly , it appears to belittle religion by restricting its scope to the care of the poor , as if the other sections of society were_not of its concern . More than_that , under the shadow of its name there might easily lurk a design to attack all legitimate power , either civil or sacred . Wherefore , since_this discussion -isaia-_now so widespread , and so bitter , the consciousness of duty warns Us to put a check on this controversy and to define what Catholics are to think on this_matter . We also propose to describe how the movement may extend its scope and be made more useful to the commonwealth . What Social Democracy -isaia- and what Christian Democracy ought to be , assuredly no one_can doubt . The first , with due consideration to the greater or less intemperance of its utterance , -isaia- carried to such an excess by many as to maintain that_there_-isaia- really nothing existing above the natural order of things , and that the acquirement and enjoyment of corporal and external goods constitute man s happiness . It aims -atti_degli_apostoli- putting all government in the hands of the masses , reducing all ranks to the same level , abolishing all distinction of class , and finally introducing community of goods . Hence , the right to own private_property -isaia- to be abrogated , and whatever property a man possesses , or whatever means of livelihood he has , -isaia- to be common to all . As against this , Christian Democracy , by the fact that_it_-isaia- Christian , -isaia- built , and necessarily so , on the basic principles of divine faith , and it must provide better conditions for the masses , with the ulterior object of promoting the perfection of souls made for things eternal . Hence , for Christian Democracy , justice -isaia- sacred ; it must maintain that the right of acquiring and possessing property cannot be impugned , and it must safeguard the various distinctions and degrees which_are indispensable in every well ordered commonwealth . Finally , it must endeavor to preserve in every human_society the form and the character which God ever impresses on it . It -isaia- clear , therefore_,_that there in nothing in common between Social and Christian Democracy . They differ from each_other as much as the sect of socialism differs from the profession of Christianity . Moreover , it would be a crime to distort this name of Christian Democracy to politics , for , although democracy , both in its philological and philosophical significations , implies popular government , yet in its present application it must be employed without_any political significance , so as to mean nothing else than_this beneficent Christian action in behalf of the people . For , the laws of nature and of the Gospel , which by right are superior to all human contingencies , are necessarily independent of all particular forms of civil government , while -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time they_are in harmony_with everything that_-isaia-_not repugnant to morality and justice . They are , therefore , and they_must remain absolutely free_from the passions and the vicissitudes of parties , so that , under whatever political constitution , the citizens may and ought to abide by those laws which command them to love God above all things , and their neighbors as themselves . This has_always_been the policy of the Church . The Roman Pontiffs acted upon this principle , whenever they dealt_with different countries , no matter what might be the character of their governments . Hence , the mind and the action of Catholics devoted to promoting the welfare of the working classes can_never be actuated with the purpose of favoring and introducing one government in place of another . In the same manner , we must remove from Christian Democracy another possible subject of reproach , namely_,_that while looking after_the advantage of the working people it should seem to overlook the upper classes of society , for they_also are of the greatest use in preserving and perfecting the commonwealth . The Christian law of charity , which_has just been mentioned , will prevent us from so doing . For it embraces all men , irrespective of ranks , as members of one_and_the_same family , children of the same most beneficent Father , redeemed by the same Saviour , and called to the same eternal heritage . Hence the doctrine of the Apostle , who warns us that '' We are one_body and one spirit called to the one hope in our vocation ; one Lord , one faith and one baptism ; one God and the Father of all who_-isaia- above all , and through all , and in us all . '' Wherefore , on account of the union established by nature between_the common people and the other classes of society , and which Christian brotherhood makes still closer , whatever diligence we devote to assisting the people will certainly profit also the other classes , the more so since , as will be thereafter shown , their co operation -isaia- proper and necessary_for the success of this undertaking . Let there be no question of fostering under this name of Christian Democracy any intention of diminishing the spirit of obedience , or of withdrawing people from their lawful rulers . Both the natural and the Christian law command us to revere those_who in their various grades are shown above us in the State , and to submit ourselves to their just commands . It -isaia- quite in keeping_with our dignity as men and Christians to obey , not_only exteriorly , but_from the heart , as the Apostle expresses it , '' for conscience sake , '' when he commands us to keep our soul subject to the higher powers . It -isaia- abhorrent to the profession of Christianity that any one_should feel unwilling to be subject and obedient to those_who rule in the Church , and first of all to the bishops whom without prejudice to the universal power of the Roman Pontiff '' the Holy Spirit has placed to rule_the Church of God which Christ has purchased by His Blood . '' He who thinks or acts otherwise -isaia- guilty of ignoring the grave precept of the Apostle who bids us to obey our rulers and to be subject to them , for they watch as having to give an account of our souls . Let the faithful everywhere implant these_principles deep in their_souls , and put them in practice in their_daily life , and let_the ministers of the Gospel meditate them profoundly , and incessantly labor , not merely by exhortation but especially by example , to teach them to others . We have recalled these_principles , which on other occasions We had_already elucidated , in the hope_that all dispute about the name of Christian Democracy will cease and that all suspicion of any danger coming from what_the name signifies will be put -atti_degli_apostoli- rest . And with reason do We hope so ; for , neglecting the opinions of certain men whose views on the nature and efficacy of this_kind of Christian Democracy are_not free_from exaggeration and from error , let no one condemn that zeal which , in accordance_with_the natural and divine laws , aims to make_the condition of those_who toil more tolerable ; to enable them to obtain , little by little , those means by which_they may provide_for the future ; to help_them to practice in public and in private the duties which morality and religion inculcate ; to aid them to feel that_they_are not animals but men , not heathens but Christians , and so to enable them to strive more zealously and more eagerly for the one_thing which_-isaia- necessary ; viz . , that ultimate good for which_we_are born into this_world . This -isaia- the intention ; this_-isaia- the work of those_who wish_that the people should be animated by Christian sentiments and should be protected from the contamination of socialism which threatens them . We have designedly made mention here of virtue and religion . For , it -isaia- the opinion of some , and the error -isaia-_already very common , that the social_question -isaia- merely an economic one , whereas in point of fact it -isaia- , above all , a moral and religious matter , and for that_reason must be settled by the principles of morality and according to the dictates of religion . For , even_though wages are doubled and the hours of labor are shortened and food -isaia- cheapened , yet , if the working man hearkens to the doctrines that_are taught on this_subject , as he -isaia- prone to do , and -isaia- prompted by the examples set before him to throw off respect_for God and to enter upon a life of immorality , his labors and his gain will avail him naught . Trial and experience have_made it abundantly clear_that many a workman lives in cramped and miserable quarters , in spite of his shorter hours and larger wages , simply because he has cast aside the restraints of morality and religion . Take away the instinct which Christian wisdom has planted and nurtured in men s hearts , take away foresight , temperance , frugality , patience , and other rightful , natural habits , no matter how_much he may strive , he will_never achieve prosperity . That -isaia- the reason_why We have incessantly exhorted Catholics to enter these associations for bettering the condition of the laboring classes , and to organize other undertakings with the same object in view ; but We have likewise warned them that all this should be done under the auspices of religion , with its help and under its guidance . The zeal of Catholics on behalf of the masses -isaia-_especially praiseworthy because_it_-isaia- engaged in the very same field in which , under the benign inspiration of the Church the active industry of charity has_always labored , adapting itself in all cases to the varying exigencies of the times . For the law of mutual charity perfects , as it were , the law of justice , not merely by giving each man his due and in not impeding him in the exercise of his rights , but_also by befriending him , '' not_with the word alone , or the lips , but in deed and in truth '' ; being mindful of what Christ so lovingly said to His own : '' A new commandment I give unto you , that_you love one_another , as I have loved you , that_you love also one_another . By this shall all men know_that you_are My disciples , if you_have love_one for the other . '' This zeal in coming to the rescue of our fellow men should , of course , be solicitous , first for the eternal good of souls , but it must_not neglect what_-isaia-_good and helpful for this_life . We should remember what Christ said to the disciple of the Baptist who asked him : '' Art thou he that art to come or look we for another ? '' He invoked , as proof of the mission given to Him among_men , His exercise of charity , quoting for them the text of Isaias : '' The blind see , the lame walk , the lepers are cleansed , the deaf hear , the dead rise again , the poor have_the Gospel preached to them . '' And speaking also of the last judgment and of the rewards and punishments He will assign , He declared that He would take special account of the charity men exercised toward each_other . And in that discourse there_-isaia-_one thing that especially excites our surprise , viz . , that Christ omits those works of mercy which comfort the soul and referring only to those_which comfort the body , He regards them as being done to Himself : '' For I was hungry and you gave Me to eat ; I was thirsty and you gave Me to drink ; I was a stranger and you took Me in ; naked and you covered Me ; sick and you visited Me ; I was in prison and you came to Me '' . To the teachings which enjoin the twofold charity of spiritual and corporal works Christ adds His own example , so that_no_one may fail to recognize_the importance which He attaches to it . In the present instance we recall_the sweet words that came from His paternal heart : '' I have pity on the multitude , '' as well as the desire He had to assist them even if it were necessary to invoke His miraculous power . Of His tender compassion we have_the proclamation made in holy Writ , viz . , that '' He went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil . '' This law of charity_which He imposed upon His Apostles , they in the most_holy and zealous way put into_practice ; and after them those_who embraced Christianity originated that wonderful variety of institutions for alleviating all the miseries by which mankind -isaia- afflicted . And these institutions carried on and continually increased their powers of relief and were_the especial glories of Christianity and of the civilization of which it was_the source , so that right minded men never fail to admire those foundations , aware as they_are of the proneness of men to concern themselves about their_own and neglect the needs of others . Nor are we to eliminate from the list of good_works the giving of money for charity , in pursuance of what Christ has said : '' But yet that_which remaineth , give alms . '' Against this , the socialist cries out and demands its abolition as injurious to the native dignity of man . But , if it -isaia- done in the manner which_the Scripture enjoins , and in conformity_with_the true Christian spirit , it neither connotes pride in the giver nor inflicts shame upon the one_who receives . Far from being dishonorable for_man , it draws closer the bonds of human_society of augmenting the force of the obligation of the duties which men_are under with_regard to each_other . No one_-isaia- so rich that he does_not need another s help ; no one so poor as not to be useful in some_way to his fellow man ; and the disposition to ask assistance from others with confidence and to grant it with kindness -isaia-_part of our very nature . Thus , justice and charity are so linked_with each_other , under the equable and sweet law of Christ , as to form an admirable cohesive power in human_society and to lead all of its_members to exercise a sort of providence in looking after their_own and in seeking the common_good as well . As regards not merely the temporary aid given to the laboring classes , but the establishment of permanent institutions in their behalf , it -isaia- most commendable for charity to undertake them . It will thus see_that more certain and more reliable means of assistance will be afforded to the necessitous . That kind of help -isaia-_especially worthy of recognition which forms the minds of mechanics and laborers to thrift and foresight , so that in course of time they may_be_able , in part -atti_degli_apostoli- least , to look out for themselves . To aim -atti_degli_apostoli- that -isaia-_not_only to dignify the duty of the rich toward_the poor , but to elevate the poor themselves , for , while it urges them to work in order to improve their condition , it preserves them meantime from danger , it refrains immoderation in their desires , and acts as a spur in the practice of virtue . Since , therefore , this_-isaia- of such_great avail and so much in keeping_with_the spirit of the times , it -isaia- a worthy object for the charity of righteous men to undertake with prudence and zeal . Let it be understood , therefore_,_that this_devotion of Catholics to comfort and elevate the mass of the people -isaia- in keeping_with_the spirit of the Church and -isaia- most conformable to the examples which_the Church has_always held up for imitation . It matters very little whether it goes under the name of the Popular Christian Movement or Christian Democracy , if the instructions that_have been_given by Us be fully carried_out with fitting obedience . But it -isaia- of the greatest importance that Catholics should be one in mind , will , and action in a matter of such_great moment . And it -isaia-_also of importance that the influence of these undertakings should be extended by the multiplication of men and means devoted to the same object . Especially must there be appeals to the kindly assistance of those_whose rank , wealth , and intellectual as well as spiritual culture give_them a certain standing in the community . If their help -isaia- not extended , scarcely anything can be done which_will help in promoting the well_being of the people . Assuredly , the more earnestly many of those_who_are prominent citizens conspire effectively to attain that object , the quicker and surer will the end be reached . We would , however , have them understand_that they_are_not -atti_degli_apostoli- all free to look after or neglect those_who happen to be beneath them , but that_it_-isaia- a strict duty which binds them . For , no one lives only_for his personal advantage in a community ; he lives for the common_good as well , so that , when others cannot contribute their share for the general good , those_who can do so are obliged to make up the deficiency . The very extent of the benefits they have_received increases the burden of their responsibility , and a stricter account will_have to be rendered to God who bestowed those blessings upon them . What should_also urge all to the fulfillment of their_duty in this_regard -isaia- the widespread disaster which_will eventually fall upon all classes of society if his assistance does_not arrive in time ; and therefore -isaia- it that he who neglects the cause of the distressed masses -isaia- disregarding his_own interest as well as that of the community . If this action , which_-isaia- social in the Christian sense of the term develops and grows in accordance_with its_own nature , there_will be no danger , as -isaia- feared , that_those other institutions , which_the piety of our ancestors have established and which_are now flourishing , will decline or be absorbed by new foundations . Both of them spring from the same root of charity and religion , and not_only do not conflict with each_other , but can easily be made to coalesce and combine so perfectly as to provide , all the better by the pooling of their beneficent efforts , for the needs of the masses and for the daily increasing perils to which_they_are exposed . The condition of things -atti_degli_apostoli- present proclaims , and proclaims vehemently , that_there_-isaia- need_for a union of brave minds with all the resources they_can command . The harvest of misery -isaia- before our_eyes , and the dreadful projects of the most disastrous national upheavals are threatening us from the growing power of the socialistic movement . They have insidiously worked their_way into the very_heart of the community , and in the darkness of their secret gatherings , and in the open light of day , in their writings and their harangues , they_are urging the masses onward to sedition ; they fling aside religious discipline ; they scorn duties ; they clamor only_for rights ; they_are working incessantly on the multitudes of the needy which daily grow greater , and which , because_of_their poverty are easily deluded and led into error . It -isaia- equally the concern of the State and of religion , and all good men should deem it a sacred duty to preserve and guard both in the honor which_-isaia- their due . That this_most desirable agreement of wills should be maintained , it -isaia- essential that all refrain from giving any cause of dissension which hurt and divide minds . Hence , in newspapers and in speeches to the people , let_them avoid subtle and practically useless questions which_are neither easy to solve nor easy to understand except by minds of unusual ability and after_the most serious study . It -isaia- quite natural for people to hesitate on doubtful subjects , and that different men should hold different opinions , but those_who sincerely seek after truth will preserve equanimity , modesty , and courtesy in matters of dispute . They will_not let differences of opinion deteriorate into conflicts of wills . Besides , to whatever opinion a man s judgment may incline , if the matter -isaia- yet open to discussion , let_him keep it , provided he be always disposed to listen with religious obedience to what_the Holy See may decide on the question . The action of Catholics , of whatever description it may be , will work with_greater effect if all of the various associations , while preserving their individual rights , move together under one primary and directive force . In Italy , We desire_that this directive force should emanate from the Institute of Catholic Congresses and Reunions so often praised by Us , to which Our predecessor and We Ourselves have committed the charge of controlling the common action of Catholics under the authority and direction of the bishops of the country . So let it be for other nations , in case there be any leading organization of this description to which this_matter has_been legitimately entrusted . Now , in all questions of this_sort where_the interests of the Church and the Christian people_are so closely allied , it -isaia- evident what_they who_are in the sacred_ministry should do , and it -isaia- clear how industrious they_should be in inculcating right doctrine and in teaching the duties of prudence and charity . To go out and move among the people , to exert a healthy influence on them by adapting themselves to the present condition of things , -isaia- what more_than_once in addressing the clergy We have advised . More frequently , also , in writing to the bishops and other dignitaries of the Church , and especially of late , We have lauded this affectionate solicitude for the people and declared it to be the special duty of both the secular and regular clergy . But in the fulfillment of this obligation let there be the greatest caution and prudence exerted , and let it be done after_the fashion of the saints . Francis , who_was poor and humble , Vincent of Paul , the father of the afflicted classes , and very many_others whom_the Church keeps ever in her memory were wont to lavish their care upon the people , but in such wise as not to be engrossed overmuch or to be unmindful of themselves or to let it prevent them_from laboring with the same assiduity in the perfection of their_own soul and the cultivation of virtue . There remains one_thing upon which We desire to insist very strongly , in which not_only the ministers of the Gospel , but_also all those_who_are devoting themselves to the cause of the people , can with very little difficulty bring_about a most commendable result . That -isaia- to inculcate in the minds of the people , in a brotherly way and whenever the opportunity presents itself , the following principles ; viz . : to keep aloof on all occasions from seditious acts and seditious men ; to hold inviolate the rights of others ; to show a proper respect to superiors ; to willingly perform the work in which_they_are employed ; not to grow weary of the restraint of family_life which in many_ways -isaia- so advantageous ; to keep to their religious practices above all , and in their hardships and trials to have_recourse to the Church for consolation . In the furtherance of all this , it -isaia- of great help to propose the splendid example of the Holy Family of Nazareth , and to advise the invocation of its protection , and it also helps to remind the people of the examples of sanctity which_have shone in the midst of poverty , and to hold up before them the reward that awaits them in the better life to come . Finally , We recur again to what We have_already declared and We insist upon it most solemnly ; viz . , that whatever projects individuals or associations form in this_matter should be formed under episcopal authority . Let them_not be led astray by an excessive zeal in the cause of charity . If it leads them to be wanting in proper submission , it -isaia- not a sincere zeal ; it will not_have any useful result and cannot be acceptable to God . God delights in the souls of those_who put aside their_own designs and obey the rulers of His Church as if they_were obeying Him ; He assists them even_when they attempt difficult things and benignly leads them to their desired end . Let them show , also , examples of virtue , so as to prove that a Christian -isaia- a hater of idleness and self indulgence , that he stands firm and unconquered in the midst of adversity . Examples of that kind have a power of moving people to dispositions of soul that make for salvation , and have all the greater force as the condition of those_who give_them -isaia- higher in the social scale . We exhort you_,_venerable_brethren , to provide_for all this , as the necessities of men and of places may require , according to your prudence and your zeal , meeting as usual in council to combine with each_other in your plans for the furtherance of these projects . Let your solicitude watch and let your authority be effective in controlling , compelling , and also in preventing , lest any_one under the pretext of good should cause the vigor of sacred discipline to be relaxed or the order which Christ has established in His Church to be disturbed . Thus , by the rightful , harmonious and ever_increasing labor of all Catholics , let it become more_and_more evident_that the tranquillity of order and the true prosperity flourish especially among_those peoples whom_the Church controls and influences ; and that_she holds it as her sacred duty to admonish every_one of what_the law of God enjoins , to unite the rich and the poor in the bonds of fraternal charity , and to lift up and strengthen men s souls in the times when adversity presses heavily upon them . Let Our commands and Our wishes be confirmed by the words so full of apostolic charity_which the blessed Paul addressed to the Romans : '' I beseech you therefore brethren , be reformed in the newness of your mind ; he that giveth , with simplicity ; he that ruleth , with carefulness ; he that showeth mercy , with cheerfulness . Let love be without dissimulation . Hating that_which_-isaia- evil ; cleaving to that_which_-isaia- good ; loving one_another with the charity of brotherhood ; with honor preventing one_another ; in carefulness , not slothful ; rejoicing in hope ; patient in tribulation ; instant in prayer . Communicating to the necessities of the saints . Rejoice with_them that rejoice ; weep with_them that weep ; being of one mind to one_another ; to no man rendering evil for evil ; providing good things not_only in the sight of God but_also in the sight , of men . As a pledge of these benefits receive the apostolic_benediction which , venerable_brethren , We grant most lovingly in the Lord to you and your clergy_and_people .
