Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Benediction . The Holy City of God , which_-isaia- the Church , not being contained within_the limits of any State , has from its Founder this infused power that_every day it enlarges more_and_more '' the place of its tent , '' and '' stretches out the skins of its tabernacles . '' But this growth of Christian nations , although it -isaia- chiefly caused by the interior breathing and help of the Holy Spirit , -isaia- nevertheless brought_about externally by the action of men and in a human manner ; for the wisdom of God demands_that all things should be ordered and brought to their completion in that manner which_-isaia- fitting to the nature of each . But there_-isaia- not one only kind of men or of office , by which_-isaia- brought_about the accession of new citizens to this terrestrial Sion . For the first_place -isaia- that of those_who preach the Word of God ; Christ taught this by His example and His precepts ; the Apostle Paul urged this in these_words : '' How shall they believe Him of whom they_have not heard ? And how shall they hear without a preacher ? . Faith then cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of Christ . '' But this office belongs to those_who_have been duly admitted to minister in sacred things . To them , moreover , those_who_are wont either to supply help in external matters or to bring down heavenly graces by prayers poured forth to God afford no little help and support . Wherefore the women in the Gospel are praised , who when Christ was preaching the kingdom of God , '' ministered unto Him of their substance '' , and Paul testifies that to those_who preach the Gospel has_been granted , by the will of God , that_they_should live of the Gospel . In like_manner we know_that Christ so commanded His followers and hearers : '' Pray ye the Lord of the harvest that he send forth labourers into His harvest , '' and that His first disciples , following the Apostles , were accustomed in this manner to address God in prayer : '' Grant unto Thy servants that_with all confidence they_may speak Thy word . These two offices which consist in giving and in praying are both very useful in extending wider the borders of the Kingdom of heaven , and also have this property , that_they_can easily be fulfilled by men of all ranks . For who_-isaia- there of such slender fortune that_he_-isaia- hindered from giving -atti_degli_apostoli- one time or other a small alms , or occupied by so many things_that he cannot pray to God for the messengers of the Holy Gospel ? Apostolic men_have ever been accustomed to use helps of this_kind , particularly the Roman Pontiffs , on whom especially devolves the care of propagating the Christian Faith ; although the method of collecting these supplies has not always_been the same , but varied and diverse , according to the variety of places and the diversity of times . When , in Our time , people desire to attempt difficult enterprises with the united counsel and strength of several persons , we have_seen societies everywhere established , of which some have_been formed for this_very purpose , viz . , to serve for the propagating of religion in certain countries . Amongst others shines_forth the pious association founded about sixty years_ago -atti_degli_apostoli- Lyons , in France , which has_taken the name of the Propagation of the Faith . Its first object was to carry assistance to certain missions in America : soon , like the grain of mustard seed , it grew to a large tree , whose umbrageous branches spread far and wide , so that it affords effectual help to all missions all over the earth . This grand institution was promptly approved by the Pastors of the Church , and has_been honoured by abundant laudatory testimonials . The Roman Pontiffs Pius VII , Leo XII , Pius VIII , Our Predecessors , both strongly commended it and enriched it with the gifts of Indulgences . And Gregory XVI . still_more warmly favoured it and embraced it in the fullness of his paternal charity , since he , in his Encyclical Letters dated the th day of August , in the th year of this century , spoke of the same in these terms . : '' We judge to be most worthy of the admiration and love of all good men this truly great and most_holy work , which by modest offerings and daily prayers addressed by each associate to God -isaia- sustained , increased and grows strong , and which_-isaia- occupied in maintaining Apostolic labourers and in exercising works of Christian charity towards neophytes , as well as in delivering the faithful from the attack of persecutions . Nor must we think that_it_-isaia- without a peculiar design of Divine Providence that an institution of so much advantage and utility to the Church has in these latter times been vouchsafed to her . For whilst all kinds of machinations of the infernal enemy harrass the beloved spouse of Christ , nothing could have happened more opportunely for_her than that_the_faithful , influenced by a desire of propagating Catholic truth , should with united zeal and collected strength endeavour to gain all men to Christ . '' With this preface he exhorted the Bishops to apply themselves_with diligence , each in his_own diocese , so that so salutary an institution might daily grow and increase . Nor did Pius IX . , of glorious memory , depart from the footsteps of his Predecessor , seeing that he allowed no opportunity to pass by of assisting this_most deserving society , and of promoting its prosperity . Indeed , by his authority more ample privileges of Pontifical Indulgence were granted to the associates , the piety of Christians was excited to the sustaining of its work , and the most eminent among the associates , whose special merits were manifest , were decorated with various insignia of honour ; finally certain external aids which accrued to this institution were by the same Pontiff honoured with praise and approval . At the same_time pious emulation caused the coalition of two other societies one called '' of the Holy Infancy of Jesus Christ , '' and the other '' of the Schools of the East . '' The first undertook to rescue and bring up in Christian habits the unhappy children whom their_parents , pressed by idleness or want , exposed inhumanly , especially in China , where this barbarous custom -isaia- most frequent . These children the charity of the Confraternity embraces tenderly , sometimes redeems them by payment of a sum of money and takes care that_they_are washed in the layer of regeneration , so that_they_may , with the help of God , be brought up as the hope of the Church , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least may , in case of their death , be endowed_with the means of acquiring everlasting happiness . The other association which_we_have mentioned -isaia- occupied with_those_who are growing up , and strives by every_means to imbue them_with sound doctrine , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time -isaia- watchful to ward off from them the dangers of false science to which_they_are very frequently exposed through careless eagerness for the acquisition of knowledge . But both of these societies yield support to that older one entitled the Society of the Propagation of the Faith , and , united with it in a friendly alliance , aim -atti_degli_apostoli- the same end , relying on the alms and prayers of the Christian nations : for all have_the same purpose in view , namely , by the diffusion of the Gospel light to bring_the largest possible number of those outside the Church to the knowledge and worship of God and Jesus Christ Whom He has_sent . Hence Our predecessor Pius IX . , as We have intimated , has in Apostolic letters commended these_two institutions and liberally enriched them_with sacred Indulgences . These three associations , therefore , having flourished with_such marked favour of the Sovereign Pontiffs and having never ceased to pursue each_one its work without rivalry , have produced abundant fruits of salvation , have powerfully assisted Our Congregation of the Propaganda in discharging the onerous duties of its missions , and have prospered to such a degree as to give for the future the joyful hope of a richer harvest . But the numerous and violent storms which_have_been let loose against the Church in the countries long illuminated by the light of the Gospel have brought injury on the works designed to civilize barbarous nations . Many causes , indeed , have combined to diminish the number and generosity of the associates . And , indeed , when so many perverse opinions are scattered abroad among the masses , sharpening their appetites for earthly happiness and banishing the hope of heavenly goods , what can be expected of those_who use their_minds to invent pleasures and their bodies to realise them ? Do men like these pour forth their prayers to God that in His mercy he may bring to the Divine light of the Gospel by His victorious grace the people sitting in the darkness ? Do they contribute subsidies to the priests_who labour and do combat for the faith ? The misfortunes of the time also have helped to diminish the generous impulses of pious persons themselves , partly because through the abounding of iniquity the love of many has waxed cold , and partly because political disturbances without counting the fear of still worse times have rendered the majority of them more bent on economy and less liberal in giving of their substance . On the other_hand many and grave necessities weigh upon and oppress the Apostolic missions , since_the number of sacred labourers decreases every_day , nor do We find that as many or as zealous missionaries replace those_whom death has carried off , whom age has enfeebled , or whom work has broken down . For We see Religious communities , whence a large number of missionaries came forth , dissolved by iniquitous laws , the clergy torn away from the altar and obliged to undergo military service , and the goods of both orders of clergy almost everywhere put up to sale and proscribed . In the meanwhile new routes have_been opened , in consequence of more complete exploration of places and populations , towards countries hitherto accounted impracticable ; numerous expeditions of the soldiers of Christ have_been formed , and new stations have_been established ; and thus many labourers are_now wanted to devote_themselves to these missions , and contribute seasonable help . We pass over in silence the difficulties and obstacles arising from contradictions . For it often occurs that deceivers , sowing error , simulate the Apostles of Christ , and , being abundantly furnished with human resources , interfere with the ministry of Catholic priests , or creep in after their departure , or raise pulpit against pulpit , thinking it sufficient to render the way of salvation doubtful to the persons_who hear_the word of God interpreted in different_ways . Would that_their artifices had no success ! This -isaia- certainly to be regretted , that_even those_who_are disgusted with_such teachers , or have_never met with_them , and who desire the pure light of truth , should often have no man -atti_degli_apostoli- hand to instruct them in wholesome doctrine and to bring them_into the bosom of the Church . Truly the little ones ask for bread , and there_-isaia- none to break it to them ; the regions are white for the harvest , and the harvest -isaia- plenteous , but the labourers are few and will soon , perhaps , be fewer still . This being so , Venerable Brethren , We consider it Our duty to stimulate the pious efforts and charity of Christians , so that_they_may strive , whether by prayer or by donations , to help the sacred work of missions and to show favour to the propagation_of_the_faith . The good which_it_-isaia- proposed to secure , and the fruits to be gathered , prove the importance of this_holy enterprise . For this_work tends directly to the glory of the Divine name and to the spread of the Kingdom of Christ upon earth . But it -isaia- incredibly beneficial to those_who_are called out of the filth of vice and the shadow of death ; and who , being made partakers of eternal_life , are_also brought out of barbarism and a state of savage manners into the fulness of civilised life . Moreover , it -isaia- highly useful and advantageous to those_who take any part in it , since it procures them spiritual riches , supplies them_with an occasion of merit , and renders , as it were , God himself their debtor . We exhort you , therefore , Venerable Brethren , again_and_again , you_who are_called to share in Our solicitude that_with one accord you sedulously and earnestly strive to aid the Apostolic missions , putting your trust in God , and not allowing yourselves to be deterred by any difficulty . The salvation_of_souls -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- stake , for_which Our Saviour laid_down His life , and appointed us bishops and priests to the work of the saints , for the perfecting of His body . Wherefore , while each_one remains -atti_degli_apostoli- the post where God has placed him , and guards the flock that God has_entrusted to him , let us endeavour to the utmost that_the_holy missions may be furnished with_those supports of which We have spoken as having_been in use since_the beginnings of the Church , namely , the preaching of the Gospel and the prayers and alms of pious men . If , therefore , you_know any zealous for the glory of God , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time disposed and fit to go on these holy expeditions , encourage them , so that , the will of God being well_known and clear , they_may listen not to flesh and blood , but_rather hasten to correspond to the call of the Holy Spirit . But from the remaining priests , from the Religious Orders of both sexes from all the faithful , in short , entrusted_to_your care , required with all urgency , that by their unremitting prayers they obtain the Divine assistance for those_who sow the seed of the Word of God . And let_them employ as intercessors the Virgin Mother of God , who_has power to destroy all the monsters of error , and her most chaste Spouse , whom many missions have_already taken as their patron and protector , and whom_the Apostolic See has recently given as Patron to the Universal Church . Let them invoke the Princes of the Apostles and the whole of that company from whom_the first preaching of the Gospel resounded throughout_the whole_world ; and in short all the others eminent for sanctity , who_have spent their strength in the same ministry and poured forth their_life together_with their blood . Let almsgiving be added to prayer , for its efficacy -isaia- such that it will render those_who_are widely separated in place and distracted with_other cares coadjutors of Apostolic men , and will make_them their companions both in labour and merit . The times , indeed , are such that_many persons suffer from want -atti_degli_apostoli- home ; but let no one despond on that account , for the amount required_for this_purpose can scarcely be a heavy contribution for any_one , although from many small sums added together tolerably large supplies can be raised . But when_you , Venerable Brethren , are engaged in exhortation , let every_one consider that_his liberality will_not be to him a loss , but a gain , because he that giveth to the poor lendeth to the Lord , and on that account_the practice of almsgiving has been_called the most profitable of all practices . Certainly if , according to the testimony of Jesus Christ , a cup of cold water given to one of these little ones will_not lose its reward , the most ample reward will await him_who shall_have spent even a small sum of money upon sacred missions , and , adding also his prayers , exercises -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time many and various offices of charity , and , doing that_which the holy Fathers have_said -isaia-_the_most divine of all divine works , becomes a helper of God Himself for the salvation of his neighbours . We feel assured , Venerable Brethren , that all those_who glory in the name of Catholic , meditating these considerations , and inflamed by your exhortations , will not_fail in this_work of piety which We have so much -atti_degli_apostoli- heart . Nor will they allow their care_for the enlargement of the kingdom of Jesus Christ to be surpassed by the alacrity and industry of those_who strive to propagate the dominion of the prince of darkness . In the meanwhile , praying God to be propitious to the pious undertakings of Christian nations , We impart most lovingly in the Lord the Apostolic benediction , as a special pledge of Our good_will , to you , Venerable Brethren , to the clergy , and the people committed to your watchful care . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the rd day of December , , in the rd year of Our Pontificate .
