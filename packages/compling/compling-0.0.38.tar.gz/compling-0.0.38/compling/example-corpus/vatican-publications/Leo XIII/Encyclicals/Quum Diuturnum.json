As We remember the long course of Our pontificate , We are conscious that We have_always endeavored to strengthen and extend Christ s kingdom among your peoples . You still remember with gratitude what We have_already done for you with the help of God , venerable_brothers . Your zealous efforts have ensured that Our deeds and planning were_not in vain . Advantages of a General Meeting . But now We want to give_you a new proof of Our regard_for you , something We have wanted to do for a long time . Since the time of the solemn celebration of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America , We have diligently sought a way to provide_for the common interests of Latin America which comprises more_than half of the New World . And We foresaw that_this could best be done if all you bishops from_these regions came together for consultation -atti_degli_apostoli- Our invitation and under Our authority . We knew that by comparing ideas and sharing the wisdom which_each of you has derived_from experience , you will be perfectly able to ensure_that the unity of Church discipline -isaia- preserved among your peoples who are_united by racial affinity ; that morals worthy of the profession of the Catholic faith flourish ; and that thus , by the concerted efforts of good citizens , the Church publicly prospers . Reason for Meeting in Rome . What greatly contributed to the realization of Our plan was that on being asked for your opinion , you welcomed Our proposal with_great approval . As the time approached to make_the idea a reality , We gave you the choice of location for_this meeting . Most of you indicated that_you would prefer to meet in Rome , especially since it would be easier for the majority of you to come here than to go to some distant American city on account of the difficulties of travel in your_own country . We could only give our complete approval to this declaration of your opinions which_was no light indication of your love for the Apostolic See . However , We are bothered that Our present circumstances do not_allow Us to treat you with all the liberality and honor We would_like when_you stay in Rome . Consequently , We have_already given orders to the Sacred Congregation , which_-isaia- in charge of interpreting the decrees of the Council of Trent , to convoke an assembly of all the bishops of Latin American countries next year in Rome and to prescribe in due time , the rules which_will govern this meeting . In the meantime , venerable_brothers , We give_you very affectionately Ourapostolic blessing as a pledge of heavenly favors and as a witness of Our goodwill to you , to the clergy , and to the people entrusted_to_your care . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s on the very day of the birth of Our Lord Jesus Christ , , in the twenty first year of OurPontificate .
