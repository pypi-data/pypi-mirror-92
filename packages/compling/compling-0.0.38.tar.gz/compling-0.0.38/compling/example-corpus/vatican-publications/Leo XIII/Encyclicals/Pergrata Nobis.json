Venerable Brethren , Greetings and Apostolic Benediction . Your gratifying joint letter was received last month . It gave convincing evidence that_you and your_people are aware of Our most recent agreement with the kingdom of Portugal , and that_you approve of it and expect that it will greatly benefit the common_good . What was proposed to Us in all these negotiations was that the privileges which_the Roman Pontiffs had given to your kings , who_have supported the Catholic cause , might be preserved for the prestige of the empire , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that the Christian interests of the Indians be better provided for . We seem to have partly achieved this_purpose , and We have confidence that We will achieve it all with the gift and the blessing of God . Therefore , considering this_most desirable outcome , We look to the future not prophetically but_with a firm hope_that the Christian name in your Portugal will_continue to flourish for the common_good and grow greater from day to day . We shall be the first to strive that the final outcome will fully justify Our hope . May God be propitious ! Without doubt We shall find great assistance in the prudence and vigilance of your bishops , in the skillful support of the clergy , and in the good_will of the Portuguese people . Indeed in a cause so noble and fruitful , the cooperation of all the men ruling the state will be -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . We have no doubt that_they_will assist Us with_their impartial wisdom , as We have recently had proof , and that_they_will continue to do so . And this_the more because zeal for the Catholic faith and the tradition of Church service -isaia- not unusual in Portugal nor of recent origin , but_-isaia- long standing and renowned . Notable Portuguese Achievements . Though Portugal -isaia- located -atti_degli_apostoli- the extremity of the Spanish peninsula and hemmed in by narrow boundaries , your renowned kings , have nevertheless extended their empire into Africa , Asia , and Oceania . Thus Portugal yields to none of the more distinguished nations and even excels many . Where did they find the strength equal to the magnitude of their undertakings ? If one_-isaia- to judge them in truth , it was from their love of religion . For in their dangerous expeditions to barbarous nations , they_were inspired , as can often be proven , to serve Christ before their_own advantage or glory , to spread the Christian religion before extending their empire . Together with the visible image of the wounds of Jesus Christ , which_was the popular flag of the nation , your ancestors had the holy cross on their galleys . In battle they_were devout and confident that they_would win noble victories whose glory would remain , not_so_much by arms as by the cross . Their piety was particularly evident when_the kings of Portugal diligently sought out apostolic men from other nations , men to follow in the footsteps of St . More than_once these_men were given the authority of Apostolic Nuncios by the Roman Pontiffs . It was most unusual and will forever accrue to the praise of your ancestors that_their leaders brought the light of the Christian faith to the most remote peoples and so merited well of the Apostolic See . Nor was there ever a time_when Our predecessors failed to give evidence of gratitude to your nation . An excellent proof of this_-isaia- the unusual insignia given to your kings . We often recall_the great things_that have_been accomplished by a nation comparatively small , and exult to use the Portuguese as an example to illustrate the great power of religion and piety . At the same_time We are deeply moved by feelings of admiration and benevolence . Recently We showed Our paternal benevolence when We arbitrated in the controversy concerning the East India matter . We treated Portugal as liberally as the nature of Our office permitted . Since it -isaia- just for equals to receive and return good_will , We expect much from the friendly government of that state . We are confident that_they_will not_only use the greatest care in carrying_out what_was agreed upon , but that_they_will work together_with Us and in consultation with you to repair the damage which_the Church suffered there . Effect upon the State . And the damage -isaia- significant , especially if We consider_the condition of your_clergy and of the religious_orders , whose downfall has affected not_only the Church but the state as well . We have_seen a dearth of prudent and strenuous helpers , who would_have labored to shape the habits of the people , to educate the youth , and to train the colonists themselves in a Christian way_of_life . Today especially , with the great need_for sacred missions in the interior of Africa , We feel this loss . Faith of the Portuguese . Now if We consider_the sources of these evils , We conclude that the desire_for impiety , which grew so greatly during the preceding century , was_not primary , even_though it penetrated your minds too as by the contagion of disease and by its presence gave rise to serious problems . Nevertheless those_who maintain that greater harm was done by internal discord in the conduct of political parties and by the upheavals of seditious mobs seem close to the truth . For no force could extinguish and no means could shake the belief and the ancient faith in the Roman Pontiff of the Portuguese people . In the very midst of the storms in your state , your_people always held that concord with the Church -isaia- the great beginning on which Christian states ought to be ruled . For this_reason_the holy bond of religious unity not_only remained unbroken , but by the authority and consent of the law , this bond afforded the foundation for political regulation . These consoling facts show that the Catholic cause can be easily strengthened with suitable remedies . Good seeds are_still alive ; when in constancy of mind and concord they_have matured the will , they_will produce an abundance of the desired fruit . Religion an Integral Part of the Portuguese Government . Those who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the head of the government and whose cooperation -isaia- so necessary to heal the wounds of the Church easily understand_that , just as Portugal attained great glory from the strength and blessings of the Catholic religion , so too the Church provides the only speedy elimination of the causes of evil . The state must_always be governed under the leadership and guidance of this_same religion . If this_-isaia- done wisely , then the government will conform to the genius , the character , and the will of the people . For the Catholic faith_-isaia- the legitimate religion of Portugal . Therefore it -isaia- entirely fitting_that it be defended by the protection of the law and the authority of the state officials , and that_its safety , continuance , and honor be publicly assured . Let its freedom and action legitimately lie in the political as well as ecclesiastical power . All should be convinced of what daily experience confirms , that far from opposing the civil_power by invidious rivalry , the Church aids the safety of the citizens and public tranquillity . Relationship between Religion and Politics . On the other_hand , those ecclesiastical authorities should realize_that the rulers of the state can and ought to trust them ; nor_should the ecclesiastical rulers accept a cause , such as retaining laws , which_the interests of the Church do not want retained . Suspicion and lack of trust often result from the rivalry of political parties . This you_know well from experience . Surely the greatest duty of Catholic men and especially of clerics -isaia- never to support a cause or to offer an opinion if it conflicts with the faith of the Church or counteracts the preservation of its rights . Everyone may hold his_own opinion in purely political matters and defend it honestly and legitimately , provided it -isaia- not contrary to religion or justice . Yet those , if there_are any , who_do_not distinguish clearly between what_-isaia- holy and what_-isaia- merely civil , commit a pernicious error which lends the name of religion to a political party . Therefore if prudence and moderation are used , not_only will there be no room_for suspicion , but that_unity of Catholics which We so vehemently desire will be strengthened . If it was more difficult formerly to obtain this_unity , the reason was perhaps too many , surely more_than was reasonable , tenaciously clung to their opinions and never for_any reason retreated from their partisan position . These positions , though they_cannot be criticized if kept within bounds , nevertheless greatly impede the attainment of the unanimity so greatly desired . Therefore cultivate a salutary union of minds , prudently removing any and all obstacles . You will succeed better by putting all your concerns together and acting nor individually , but as a group , in matters of such great_importance . In the first_place therefore it seems that_you need timely communications and the selection of a group of councillors . That this_will aptly achieve your purpose you can hardly deny , especially if you consider_the norms proposed and prescribed by the Apostolic See to deal_with such matters , i . , Our Encyclical letters about the Christian regulation of the state . For the rest We shall_not mention in detail everything which requires suitable remedies , particularly since these_matters are better understood by those of you whom_the force of the difficulties especially oppresses . Nor shall We mention those matters that require action by the civil_power in order_that the Catholic cause may receive the just consideration it deserves . The government cannot doubt Our paternal interest nor your compliance with civil law ; thus it -isaia- proper to trust that it will_give full weight to Our and your good_will . It will then strive to restore a Church afflicted with so many evils to its due degree of liberty and dignity . As for Us , as Our duty demands , We shall always be prepared to act in ecclesiastical affairs and to decide with common consent what_-isaia- most appropriate . We are_also prepared to gladly accept good and just conditions . But there_are_some significant things_which your diligence must cure one by one . The first matter -isaia- the shortage of priests caused by an insufficiency of seminaries . As a result neither the Christian instruction of the faithful nor the administration of the sacraments has_received proper care . Now , however , by the blessing of divine Providence each diocese has its_own seminary ; where_the seminaries have_not yet been restored , We hope that_they_will be shortly . Here then -isaia- the means of supplying a body of priests , provided the learning of the candidates -isaia- such as reason demands . We entrust this_matter to you , as We respect your prudence and wisdom . However lest you_should lack Our advice in this_matter , consider as addressed to yourselves what We have prescribed a short time ago to the bishops of Hungary : . '' In the education of clerics two elements are essential : learning for the development of the mind and virtue for the perfection of the soul . To the humanistic curriculum by which youths are educated must be added sacred and canonical studies . Care must_be_taken that_their content -isaia- sound , entirely pure , and in full harmony_with_the documents of the Church ; today especially_the style must be forceful and eloquent , so that he may_be_able to exhort . and to refute those_who contradict . Holiness of life without_which knowledge puffs up and does_not edify , consists not_only in good and honorable habits , but_also in that body of sacerdotal virtues which_makes good priests exemplars of Jesus Christ the eternal High Priest . In these institutions take_care that the men appointed as teachers be men of sound doctrine and good morals , men to whom_you can entrust a matter of such great_importance . Choose rectors and spiritual directors who_are outstanding for prudence , counsel , and experience . The common life and discipline should be so arranged by your authority that the students will_never offend against piety ; furthermore there_should be an abundance of all aids which nourish piety , so that the seminarians may make daily progress in acquiring the virtues proper to the sacerdotal state . '' Priests as Good Examples . Moreover your vigilance for your priests must be great and even singular , so that the smaller the number of workers , the greater their zeal in cultivating the vineyard of the Lord . The words of the Gospel , the harvest -isaia- indeed great , seem to apply literally to you , since_the people of Portugal have_always loved religious instruction ; they receive it eagerly when_they perceive in the priests , their teachers , the embellishments of virtue and the reputation for learning . It -isaia- marvelous how fruitful the future work of the clergy will be in instructing the people , but especially_the youth , when that work_-isaia- crowned with dignity and zeal . Good example -isaia- the best means of cultivating in men the love of virtue . For this_reason let all priests take_care not_only that nothing_-isaia- noted in them which_-isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with_their office and the rules of their state , but also_that the holiness of their_lives and morals may shine_forth , like a Lamp on a lampstand , giving Light to all in the house . A third problem which_should engage your continuous care concerns the printed material that_-isaia- published either daily or -atti_degli_apostoli- stated intervals . You know_the times , venerable_brethren : on the one_hand men_are consumed with an insatiable passion for reading ; on the other an enormous amount of bad literature -isaia- freely disseminated . Given these facts it -isaia- impossible to estimate how_much harm -isaia- done to good morals , what destruction daily threatens the integrity of religion . Therefore by exhortation , by admonition , by every possible means continue to call men back from such fountains of corruption and lead_them to salutary waters . It will be a great help if by your initiative and leadership daily papers are published , under the patronage of truth , virtue , and religion , to offset these poisonous evils . Now an admonition for authors who by an honest and holy determination combine the love of writing with a love and zeal for the Catholic cause . If they really want their works to be fruitful and worthy of praise , let_them remember what_-isaia- required of those_who engage in controversy for a good cause . In writing they_must exercise the greatest care to be moderate and prudent , but_above all loving . Love -isaia- the mother and companion of all the other virtues . You can see_that fickle suspicion and rash accusations are detrimental indeed to fraternal love . From this you can understand_the injustice of those_who , in favoring one political party , do not_hesitate in matters of religion to accuse others of unorthodoxy . They do this only because_they belong to another party , as though orthodox Catholic faith_-isaia- necessarily the prerogative of this or that political party . We commend all which We have either warned against or commanded to your authority , which all whom_you govern must respect and accept . This applies especially to priests_who are subject to you in their private and public lives , whether_they are engaged in the duties of the sacred_ministry or in teaching in the schools . They never cease to be under the authority of the bishops . And just as they_are obliged to lead others to the beauty of virtue by their example , so too must they lead others to obedience and the submission due to episcopal authority . That everything may proceed prosperously according to Our desire , We ask for heavenly assistance . First of all let us approach that perennial font of divine_grace , the holy Heart of our Savior Jesus Christ , devotion to whom -isaia- both primary and ancient with you . We implore the patronage of the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God , under whose special guardianship the kingdom of Portugal boasts to be . Finally we ask for the intercession of St . Elizabeth , the most_holy of royal and saintly women , and of all the holy martyrs who in the first days of the Church established or propagated Christianity in Portugal . Meanwhile , as proof of Our good_will and as a promise of heavenly_gifts , We grant you , your_clergy , and all your_people most affectionately Our Apostolic Blessing in the Lord .
