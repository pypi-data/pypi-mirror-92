Venerable Brothers , Greetings and ApostolicBenediction . We have long and ardently desired an opportunity to address you with an apostolic_letter . Just as We have addressed the bishops of many_other nations , We desire to inform you of Our plans , which concern the prosperity of the Christian cause and the salvation of the Hungarian nation . These days present Us with an excellent opportunity , since Hungary -isaia- celebrating the liberation , two centuries ago , of Budapest . That victory will stand out forever in the memory of the Hungarian people . It was granted to your ancestors , because_of_their strength and perseverance , to recapture their capital city , which for a century and a half had_been occupied by their enemies . That the grace and memory of this_divine blessing might remain , Pope Innocent XI justly decreed a celebration throughout all Christendom in honor of St . Stephen , the first of your apostolic kings , on the second day of September , the anniversary of this_great event . Moreover it -isaia- well_known that the Apostolic See took a significant part in the almost spontaneous victory three years before over the same foe -atti_degli_apostoli- Vienna . This victory , rightly attributed in great part to the apostolic efforts of Pope Innocent , began the decline of the influence of the Mohammedans in Europe . Besides , even before that age and under similar circumstances , Our predecessors assisted the Hungarian forces with counsel , aid , money , and treaties . From Callistus III to Innocent XI , many Roman Ponfiffs are recorded whose names deserve to be honored for their activity in such affairs . Let Clement VIII serve as an example . When Stregan and Vincentgraz were liberated from the domination of the Turks , the highest councils of the kingdom decreed that public thanks be given to him for he alone had come to their aid opportunely -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when the situation was almost beyond hope . Therefore , just as the Apostolic See never failed the people of Hungary whenever they_had to fight the enemies of religion and Christian morality , so now , when happy memories inspire the people , We gladly join you in sharing their joy . Taking into_account_the differing conditions of time , We desire to confirm the people in their profession of the Catholic faith and also to assist them in warding off common dangers . In this_way We shall serve the public good . Hungary herself knows that no gift of God either to individuals or to nations -isaia- greater then to receive by His grace the Catholic faith , and having received it , to keep it with perseverance . This gift contains an abundance of other gifts by means of which individual persons receive both eternal happiness in heaven and greatness and prosperity for their state on earth . When Stephen first clearly grasped this_truth , he asked God for nothing_more vehemently , indeed he labored for nothing_more energetically and consistently , than to obtain the Catholic faith for his whole kingdom and to establish it on a firm foundation from the very_beginning . Therefore very early he began a change of studies and offices among the Roman bishops , the kings , and the people of Hungary which future ages did_not abolish . Stephen founded and built a kingdom , but received his crown only from the Roman Pontiff , for he wanted to offer his_kingdom to the Apostolic See . He established many Episcopal Sees , endowing munificently , and founding piously . Accompanying these many good_works was_the good pleasure and indulgence of the Apostolic See in many matters altogether singular . From his faith and piety , this_holy king drew the light of counsel and the best norms for ruling his_kingdom . He acquired his strength from diligence in prayer , by which he put down the evil plots of public enemies and returned as victor from the attacks of his foes . Thus under the auspices of religion , your state was_born . Under the same guardian and leader , you_have come -atti_degli_apostoli- quick march not_only to maturity , but_also to the strength of empire and the glory of your name . Hungary has kept holy and inviolate the faith received_from her king and parent as an inheritance , and this despite the great difficulties of the times , when neighboring nations were drawn_from the bosom of the Church by pernicious error . Faith , obedience and devotion to the Apostolic See have remained constant in kings , bishops , and all the people . In turn We see the predilection and paternal benevolence of the Roman Pontiffs for the Hungarian people confirmed by many testimonies . Today after many centuries and many events , the original intimate friendship remains , by the blessing of God . The virtues of your ancestors are by no means lacking in their descendants . There are_many laudable and fruitful labors of the episcopate : relief in calamities , zealous defense of the rights of the Church , and your constant and courageous determination to preserve the Catholic faith . When We recall these_things , Our soul -isaia- filled_with joy . To you and to the people of Hungary , We gladly pay the tribute of praise for things well done . But We cannot remain silent . Everyone knows how inimical to virtue these times are and how the Church -isaia- attacked . We have much to fear amid such dangers , lest a shaken faith languish even where it has_taken strong and deep roots . It -isaia- enough to recall rationalism and naturalism , those deadly sources of evil whose teachings are everywhere freely distributed . We must then add the many allurements to corruption : the opposition to or open defection from the Church by public officials , the bold obstinacy of secret societies , here and there a curriculum for the education of youth without regard_for God . And if ever , then surely now -isaia- the time to realize not_only how appropriate , but entirely necessary the Catholic religion_-isaia- for public safety and tranquility . Daily experience proves to what lengths they_who fear no authority nor have ever restrained their passions will go to undermine the state . Indeed , everyone knows what_they intend , what means they employ , and with what perseverance they labor . The mightiest empires and the most flourishing states are compelled to contend almost every hour with_such societies of men , joined together in unity of intention and likeness of deeds . Thus , the public safety -isaia- always in danger . Against such audacity of evil men , a good plan has_been perfected in some places , that the authority of magistrates and the force of laws be well prepared . Effective Means of Restraining Socialism . Nevertheless to restrain the danger of socialism there_-isaia- only_one genuinely effective means , in the absence of which_the fear of punishment has little weight to discourage offenders . It -isaia- that citizens should be thoroughly educated in religion , and restrained by respect_for and love of the Church . For the Church as parent and teacher -isaia- the holy guardian of religion , moral integrity , and virtue . All who follow_the precepts of the Gospel religiously and entirely are , by this_very fact , far from the suspicion of socialism . For religion commands us to worship and fear God and to submit to and obey legitimate authority . It forbids anyone to act seditiously and demands for everyone the security of his possessions and rights . It furthermore commands those_who_have wealth to come graciously to the aid of the poor . Religion aids the needy with all the works of charity and consoles those who_suffer loss , enkindling in them the hope of the greatest eternal blessings which_will be in proportion to the labor endured and the length of that labor . Therefore those_who rule_the states will do nothing wiser and more opportune than to recognize_that religion influences the people despite all obstacles and recalls them to virtue and uprightness of character through_her teachings . To distrust the Church or hold it suspect -isaia- , in the first_place , unjust , and in the second , profits no one except the enemies of civil discipline and those bent on destruction . Keep Religion Flourishing . By the blessing of God great civil unrest and the gathering of fearsome mobs , which_have occurred elsewhere , have_been spared the people of Hungary . But threatening dangers force all of us to strive by daily zeal to assure that the name of religion flourishes there and that honor endures in its Christian institutions . For this_reason_the Church should enjoy full and integral freedom in the whole kingdom of Hungary as it did in former times , and this for the common_good . As for Us , We are_most anxious that_those things_which conflict with the rights of the Church , diminish its liberty of action , and impede the profession of the faith be removed from the laws . To attain this_end both We and you_must constantly labor , as far as We legally can and as so many illustrious men have_already done . Meanwhile , as long as these laws remain , it -isaia- your duty to see_to_it_that they injure the common security as little as possible and to admonish the citizens what they_have to do in this_matter . We shall mention some statutes which seem more injurious than others . To embrace religion_-isaia- a most serious duty , which_-isaia- nor to be restricted by age . No age -isaia- unfit for the kingdom of God . As everyone knows this , so he ought to act without delay , for from the will to act -isaia- born the right to act for everyone , which_cannot be violated without_the greatest injury . Therefore , if pastors of souls are forced to make a choice in the matter , they_must choose to endure the penalties prescribed by civil law rather_than provoke the wrath of an avenging God . You must labor , venerable_brothers , that Catholic teaching about the sanctity , oneness , and perpetuity of matrimony takes firm root in souls . Remind the faithful frequently that the marriage of Christians -isaia- subject solely to ecclesiastical authority . Remind them also what_the Church thinks and teaches concerning so called civil marriage and with what mind_and_heart Catholic people should obey such laws . Further remind them that_even for the gravest of reasons it -isaia- not permitted to enter_into marriage with Christians who_are_not Catholics ; those_who do so without_the authority and indulgence of the Church sin before God and the Church . Since these issues are so vital , all who_have a concern in this_matter should most diligently see to it , as far as they_can , that_no_one sins here for_any reason . For in this especially , obedience to the Church -isaia- necessarily bound to the public interest . This -isaia- the reason_why the beginnings and best principles of civil life depend in great part on domestic society , so that the peace and prosperity of the state result in large part from marriage . Nor can marriage succeed except under the care of God and the Church . Deprived of such care and entered upon contrary to the will of God , matrimony -isaia- reduced to the service of various passions , -isaia- deprived of necessary heavenly aids , and -isaia- despoiled of that common life which_-isaia- of greatest concern to man , i . Of necessity it produces bitter fruit , to the great harm of the family and of the state . For this_reason We must commend those Catholic men_who , when_the legislative assembly of Hungary was asked two years_ago whether it would consider_the marriage of Christians with Jews valid , rejected the proposal unanimously and freely and succeeded in having the old marriage law retained . Their vote received_the approval of the vast majority of people from all parts of Hungary , proving with admirable testimony that the people thought and felt as they did . May there be Like consent and similar constancy whenever the Catholic cause -isaia- in controversy , for then victory will be -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . At least civil life will be more vigorous and fruitful when languor and sloth have_been banished , for these_are the means by which_the enemies of the Christian name certainly wish to stupefy all Catholic virtue . Catholic Education of Youth . Nor will less profit accrue to the state if the education of youth -isaia- wisely and rightly provided for from the beginning . Such are the times and customs that too many_people with too much effort strive to keep studious youth away from the vigilance of the Church and the salutary virtue of religion . Schools called neuter , mixed , and lay are popular and sought out here and there , doubtless with the intention that the students grow up ignorant of all things holy and of all religious concerns . Since this evil -isaia- more widespread and greater_than its remedies , we see a progeny growing up uninterested in spiritual goods , without religion and often impious . Keep so great a calamity out of Hungary with all your energy ! The education of youth from childhood in Christian habits and Christian wisdom -isaia- today of the greatest possible concern not_only to the Church , but_also to the state . All who_are truly wise understand this . That -isaia- why We see many Catholic men in many places who_are deeply concerned about the proper upbringing of youth , devoting special and constant effort to this_matter , undismayed by the greatness of the labor or by the cost . We also know of many in Hungary who_are working toward_the same goal with similar proposals . Permit Us nevertheless to rouse your episcopal zeal even_more . In this grave situation , We desire_that in the public education of youth , that part be reserved to the Church which_has_been divinely assigned to it . All We can do -isaia- to exhort you to deal vigorously with this_matter . Meanwhile continue to admonish fathers again_and_again not to permit their_children to study and learn so as to threaten injury to their Catholic faith . At the same_time see_to_it_that the schools which_are under your or the clergy s direction be commendable for their soundness of doctrine and the uprightness of their teachers . This -isaia- to be understood not_only of primary schools , but_also of those of higher learning . With God fearing generosity , and especially with the liberal contributions of your kings and bishops , many noble institutions devoted to the study of letters have_been established . The memory of Cardinal Pazmany , Archbishop of Esztergom , -isaia- still alive among_you , not_only as the founder of the Catholic University -atti_degli_apostoli- Budapest , but_also as its generous patron . It -isaia- inspiring to recall that he undertook so great a work out of the pure and sincere motive of advancing the Catholic religion . King Ferdinand II confirmed this when he said of its purpose that the truth of the Catholic religion would remain unshaken where it flourished ; where weakened , it would be strengthened , and divine_worship would e propagated everywhere . We realize how diligently you_have labored to ensure_that these excellent centers of study retain their original nature , the kind that_their founders intended , namely that_they remain Catholic Institutions . Their household , administration , and faculty are entirely under the control of the Church and the bishops . Therefore We exhort you to continue to encourage this noble and excellent venture . And you will succeed because of the goodness of the Apostolic King and the prudent men in charge of the government ; also , what has_been_given to non Catholic communities will_not be denied to the Catholic Church . If the tenor of the times demands_that some new institutions are to be founded or old ones expanded , We have no doubt_that you will imitate the example of your fathers and their devotion to religion . In fact We have_received reports that_you are_already planning a school for the training of teachers ; this_-isaia- an excellent plan , one worthy of your wisdom and virtue . That you_may accomplish it quickly with the Lord s help -isaia- Our prayer and exhortation . If the education of all youth in general contributes a great deal to the true welfare of the state , this_-isaia- much_more true of the education of those aiming -atti_degli_apostoli- ordination . To this_matter you_must give special_attention ; it should occupy the greater portion of your vigils and labors , since_the youths destined for orders are the hope and , as it were , the incomplete form of future priests . You surely know how_much the reputation of the Church and the eternal_salvation of her people depend on priests . In the education of clerics , two elements are absolutely necessary : learning for the development of the mind and virtue for the perfection of the spirit . To the ordinary humanistic subjects in which youths are educated must be added Sacred and Canonical studies . Care must_be_taken that_their content -isaia- sound and everywhere pure , in full harmony_with_the documents of the Church and eloquent , so that the priest may_be_able to exhort . even_those who contradict . Holiness of life , without_which knowledge puffs up and does_not edify , consists not_only in good and honorable habits , but_also in that group of sacerdotal virtues which_makes good priests exemplars of Jesus Christ , the eternal High Priest . For this_purpose there_are sacred seminaries . You have some for youths preparing for the priesthood and others for the education of seminarians , all of them well founded . Choose teachers and spiritual directors for these institutions thoughtfully . They should be men of sound doctrine and good morals , men to whom_you can confidently entrust a matter of such great_importance . Choose rectors and spiritual guides who_are outstanding in prudence , counsel , and experience . The common life and discipline should be so arranged by your authority that not_only will the students never offend against piety , but that_there will be an abundance of all aids which nourish piety . The students should thus be encouraged to make daily progress in acquiring the sacerdotal virtues . Your industrious and diligent labors in the education of priests will bear much desirable fruit , making your episcopal office easier to administer and producing a richer profit for all . Assistance for Priests . But it -isaia- necessary_that your paternal care extend further , namely to the assistance of priests in the exercise of their_duties . Skillfully and sweetly , as becomes your love , see_to_it_that they_are_not exposed to worldly temptations and that_they_are not led by selfish desires or concern_for secular affairs . See to it that_they excel in virtue , providing an example of deeds well done . Further , see_to_it_that they never fail in their devotion to prayer and that_they approach the sacred mysteries spotlessly . When supported and strengthened by these defenses , they_will gladly fulfill their_daily sacred duties and fittingly turn to the studious cultivation of the spirits of their_people , especially by the ministry of word and sacraments . But to renew the strength of soul which human weakness does not_allow to flourish constantly , nothing seems more_effective than_that they retire from time to time to meditation , devoting all of their time solely to God and themselves . This -isaia- the custom in other places and has proven very successful . Furthermore you will easily and spontaneously get to know_the talents and the habits of individual priests as you go about administering your dioceses . You will_also learn what_you have to do by way of prohibition in this_matter , and what evils have to be eradicated . To do this and to save ecclesiastical discipline from violation , you_must use the just severity of canon_law where necessary . All must understand_that both the priesthood and the various grades of dignity are no more_than a reward for useful labors . For this_reason they_are reserved for those_who_have served the Church , who_have labored in the care of souls , and who_are distinguished for their learning and the holiness of their_lives . Concern for the Faithful . When the clergy -isaia- distinguished by these virtues , the people will profit in no small measure , since_they love the Church , are_very devoted to the ancestral religion , and easily and willingly submit to the directives of their pastors . However you must_never fail to make sure_that the integrity of Catholic doctrine -isaia- preserved in the people and that Evangelical discipline -isaia- retained in their actions , life and character . Let frequent sacred retreats for the care of souls be undertaken . To direct this_work , choose men of tried virtue , animated by the spirit of Christ , and inflamed with love of neighbor . Well written pamphlets to guard against errors or to extirpate them should be widely disseminated . They must be in accord with the truth and encourage virtue . Some societies have_already taken up this laudable proposal , with fruitful results . We wish therefore that_their number increase and that_their success continue from day to day . Another thing We wish all of you to do , but especially_those of you_who excel in learning , dignity , and authority , -isaia- that in both private and public_life , you be solicitous for the good name of religion . Let the cause of the Church be more vigorously prosecuted under your leadership . Let all present and future institutions founded to promote the Catholic cause be willingly aided and increased . In like_manner you_must oppose certain false opinions , perversely proposed to safeguard each_one s dignity , but_which are entirely contrary to the precepts and faith of Christian customs and which open the door to many pernicious and criminal acts . Finally you_must assiduously acid vehemently oppose improper organizations , particularly those_which We have mentioned in our encyclicals to other places , whose contagion must be averted by every_means . In this_matter , We desire_that you exercise care in proportion to their number , power , and resources . Urged by Our love , this_-isaia-_what We have to prescribe for you , venerablebrethren , and which We trust will be accepted by the whole nation of Hungarywith prompt obedience . The fact_that your forefathers triumphed somagnificently over bitter foes -atti_degli_apostoli- Budapest was_not solely due to their warlikefortitude , but_also to the strength of religion . Just as in the beginningreligion gave birth to the strength and authority of a great empire , so it alsopromises for the future prosperity -atti_degli_apostoli- home and glory abroad . All of thesethings , whether_they are for your honor or for your advantage , We desire foryou , and We pray that_you obtain them_with_the assistance and under thepatronage of the Blessed Virgin , Mother of God . The kingdom of Hungary has beenconsecrated to her and received its name from her . For the same reason Weearnestly ask the aid of St . Stephen , who_has blessed your kingdom with every_kind of gift for its glory and growth . We have_the certain hope_that he will look down from heaven and guard you with_his strong patronage . Relying on this hope , venerable_brothers , We impart to you individually , tothe clergy , and to all your_people , as a sign of heavenly_gifts and a proof ofOur paternal good_will , Our apostolic_benediction .
