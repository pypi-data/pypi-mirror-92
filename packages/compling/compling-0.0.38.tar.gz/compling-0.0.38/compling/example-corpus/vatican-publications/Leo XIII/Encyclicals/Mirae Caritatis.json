Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . To examine into the nature and to promote the effects of those manifestations of His wondrous love_which , like rays of light , stream forth_from Jesus Christ this , as befits Our sacred office , has_ever been , and this , with His help , to the last breath of Our life will ever be Our earnest aim and endeavour . For , whereas Our lot has_been cast in an age that_-isaia- bitterly hostile to justice and truth , we have_not failed , as you have_been reminded by the Apostolic letter which we recently addressed to you , to do what in us lay , by Our instructions and admonitions , and by such practical measures as seemed best suited for their purpose , to dissipate the contagion of error in its many shapes , and to strengthen the sinews of the Christian life . Among these efforts of Ours there_are two in particular , of recent memory , closely related to each_other , from the recollection whereof we gather some fruit of comfort , the more seasonable by reason of the many causes of sorrow that weigh us down . One of these -isaia- the occasion on which We directed , as a thing most desirable , that the entire human_race should be consecrated by a special act to the Sacred Heart of Christ our Redeemer ; the other that on which We so urgently exhorted all those_who bear the name Christian to cling loyally to Him Who , by divine ordinance , -isaia- '' the Way , the Truth , and the Life , '' not_for individuals alone bur for_every rightly constituted society . And now that_same apostolic charity , ever watchful over the vicissitudes of the Church , moves and in a manner compels Us to add one_thing more , in order to fill up the measure of what We have_already conceived and carried_out . This -isaia- , to commend to all Christians , more earnestly than heretofore , the all holy Eucharist , forasmuch as it -isaia- a divine gift proceeding from the very Heart of the Redeemer , Who '' with desire desireth '' this singular mode of union with men , a gift most admirably adapted to be the means whereby_the salutary fruits of His redemption may be distributed . Indeed We have_not failed in the past , more_than_once , to use Our authority and to exercise Our zeal in this behalf . It gives Us much pleasure to recall to mind_that We have officially approved , and enriched with canonical privileges , not_a_few institutions and confraternities having for their object the perpetual adoration of the Sacred Host ; that We have encouraged the holding of Eucharistic Congresses , the results of which_have_been as profitable as the attendance -atti_degli_apostoli- them has_been numerous and distinguished ; that We have designated as the heavenly patron of these and similar undertakings St . Paschal Baylon , whose devotion to the mystery of the Eucharist was so extraordinary . Accordingly , Venerable Brethren , it has seemed good to Us to address you on certain points connected_with this_same mystery , for the defence and honour of which_the solicitude of the Church has_been so constantly engaged , for_which Martyrs have_given their_lives , which_has afforded to men of the highest genius a theme to be illustrated by their learning , their eloquence , their skill in all the arts ; and this We will do in order to render more_clearly evident and more widely known those special characteristics by virtue of which_it_-isaia- so singularly adapted to the needs of these our_times . It was towards_the close of His mortal life_that Christ our Lord left this memorial of His measureless love for men , this powerful means of support '' for the life of the world '' St . And precisely for this_reason , We , being so soon to depart from this_life , can wish for nothing better_than that_it_may be granted to us to stir up and foster in the hearts of all men the dispositions of mindful gratitude and due devotion towards this wondrous Sacrament , wherein most especially lie , as We hold , the hope and the efficient cause of salvation and of that peace which all men so anxiously seek . Some there_are , no doubt , who_will express their surprise that_for the manifold troubles and grievous afflictions by which_our age -isaia- harassed We should_have determined to seek for remedies and redress in this quarter rather_than elsewhere , and in some , perchance , Our words will excite a certain peevish disgust . But this_-isaia- only the natural result of pride ; for when this vice has_taken possession of the heart , it -isaia- inevitable that Christian faith_,_which demands a most willing docility , should languish , and that a murky darkness in regard of divine truths should close in upon the mind ; so that in the case of many these_words should be made good : '' Whatever things they know not , they blaspheme '' St . We , however , so far_from_being hereby turned aside from the design which We have_taken in hand , are on the contrary determined all the more zealously and diligently to hold up the light for the guidance of the well disposed , and , with the help of the united prayers of the faithful , earnestly to implore forgiveness for those_who speak evil of holy things . The Source of Life . To know with an entire faith what_-isaia- the excellence of the Most Holy Eucharist -isaia- in truth to know what that work_-isaia- which , in the might of His mercy , God , made man , carried_out on behalf of the human_race . For as a right faith teaches us to acknowledge and to worship Christ as the sovereign cause of our_salvation , since He by His wisdom , His laws , His ordinances , His example , and by the shedding of His blood , made all things new ; so the same faith likewise teaches us to acknowledge Him and to worship Him as really present in the Eucharist , as verily abiding through all time in the midst of men , in order_that as their Master , their Good Shepherd , their most acceptable Advocate with the Father , He may impart to them of His own inexhaustible abundance the benefits of that redemption which He has accomplished . Now if any_one will seriously consider_the benefits which flow from the Eucharist he will understand_that conspicuous and chief among_them all -isaia- that in which_the rest , without exception , are included ; in a word it -isaia- for men the source of life , of that life_which best deserves the name . '' The bread which I will_give -isaia- my flesh , for the life of the world '' St . In more_than one way , as We have elsewhere declared , -isaia- Christ '' the life . '' He Himself declared that the reason of His advent among_men was this , that He might bring them the assured fulness of a more_than merely human_life . '' I -amos- come that_they_may have life , and may_have it more abundantly '' St . Everyone -isaia- aware_that no sooner had '' the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared '' Tit . , , than there -atti_degli_apostoli- once burst forth a certain creative force which issued in a new order of things and pused through all the veins of society , civil and domestic . Hence arose new relations_between man and man ; new rights and new duties , public_and_private ; henceforth a new direction was_given to government , to education , to the arts ; and most important of all , man s thoughts and energies were turned towards religious truth and the pursuit of holiness . Thus was life communicated to man , a life truly heavenly and divine . And thus we are to account for those expressions which so often occur in Holy Writ , '' the tree of life , '' '' the word of life , '' '' the book of life , '' '' the crown of life , '' and particularly '' the bread of life . But now , since_this life of which We are speaking bears a definite resemblance to the natural life of man , as the one draws its nourishment and strength from food , so also the other must_have its_own food whereby it may be sustained and augmented . And here it will be opportune to recall to mind on what occasion and in what manner Christ moved and prepared the hearts of men for the worthy and due reception of the living bread which He was about to give_them . No sooner had the rumour spread of the miracle which He had wrought on the shores of the lake of Tiberias , when with the multiplied loaves He fed the multitude , than many forthwith flocked to Him in the hope_that they , too , perchance , might be the recipients of like favour . And , just as He had taken occasion from the water which_she had drawn_from the well to stir up in the Samaritan woman a thirst_for that '' water which springeth up unto life everlasting '' St . , , so now Jesus availed Himself of this opportunity to excite in the minds of the multitude a keen hunger for the bread '' which endureth unto life everlasting '' St . Or , as He was careful to explain to them , was_the bread which He promised the same as that heavenly manna which_had_been given to their fathers during their wanderings in the desert , or again the same as that_which , to their amazement , they_had recently received_from Him ; but He was Himself that bread : '' I , '' said He , '' -amos- the bread of life '' St . And He urges this still further upon them all both by invitation and by precept : '' if any man shall eat of this bread , he shall live for ever ; and the bread which I will_give -isaia- my flesh , for the life of the world '' St . And in these other_words He brings home to them the gravity of the precept : '' Amen , Amen , I say to you , unless you shall eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood , you shall_not have life in you '' St . Away then with the widespread but most mischievous error of those_who give it as their opinion that the reception of the Eucharist -isaia- in a manner reserved for those narrow minded persons as they_are deemed who rid themselves of the cares of the world in order to find rest in some kind of professedly religious_life . For this_gift , than which nothing can be more excellent or more conducive to salvation , -isaia- offered to all those , whatever their office or dignity may be , who wish as every_one ought to wish to foster in themselves that life of divine_grace whose goal -isaia- the attainment of the life of blessedness with God . Indeed it -isaia- greatly to be desired that_those men would rightly esteem and would make due provision for life everlasting , whose industry or talents or rank have put it in their_power to shape the course of human events . But alas ! we see with sorrow that_such men too_often proudly flatter themselves that_they_have conferred upon this_world as it were a fresh lease of life and prosperity , inasmuch as by their_own energetic action they_are urging it on to the race for wealth , to a struggle for the possession of commodities which minister to the love of comfort and display . And yet , whithersoever we turn , we see_that human_society , if it be estranged from God , instead of enjoying that peace in its possessions for_which it had sought , -isaia- shaken and tossed like one_who_-isaia- in the agony and heat of fever ; for while it anxiously strives for prosperity , and trusts to it alone , it -isaia- pursuing an object that ever escapes it , clinging to one_that ever eludes the grasp . For as men and states alike necessarily have_their being from God , so they_can do nothing good except in God through Jesus Christ , through whom every best and choicest gift has_ever proceeded and proceeds . But the source and chief of all these gifts -isaia- the venerable Eucharist , which not_only nourishes and sustains that life the desire whereof demands our most strenuous efforts , but_also enhances beyond measure that dignity of man of which in these_days we hear so much . For what can be more honourable or a more worthy object of desire than to be made , as far_as_possible , sharers and partakers in the divine nature ? Now this_-isaia- precisely what Christ does for us in the Eucharist , wherein , after_having raised man by the operation of His grace to a supernatural state , he yet more_closely associates and unites him_with Himself . For there_-isaia- this difference between_the food of the body and that of the soul , that whereas the former -isaia- changed into_our substance , the latter changes us into its_own ; so that St . Augustine makes Christ Himself say : '' You shall_not change Me into yourself as you do the food of your body , but you shall be changed into Me '' confessions . The Mystery of Faith . Moreover , in this_most admirable Sacrament , which_-isaia- the chief means whereby men_are engrafted on the divine nature , men also find the most efficacious help towards progress in every_kind of virtue . And first of all in faith . In all ages faith_has been attacked ; for although it elevates the human mind by bestowing on it the knowledge of the highest truths , yet because , while it makes known the existence of divine mysteries , it yet leaves in obscurity the mode of their being , it -isaia- therefore thought to degrade the intellect . But whereas in past times particular articles of faith have been_made by turns the object of attack ; the seat of war has since been enlarged and extended , until it has come to this , that_men deny altogether that_there_-isaia- anything above and beyond nature . Now nothing can be better adapted to promote a renewal of the strength and fervour of faith in the human mind than the mystery of the Eucharist , the '' mystery of faith , '' as it has_been most appropriately called . For in this one mystery the entire supernatural order , with all its wealth and variety of wonders , -isaia- in a manner summed up and contained : '' He hath made a remembrance of His wonderful works , a merciful and gracious Lord ; He bath given food to them that fear Him '' Psalm cx , . For whereas God has subordinated the whole supernatural order to the Incarnation of His Word , in virtue whereof salvation has_been restored to the human_race , according to those words of the Apostle ; '' He bath purposed . to re establish all things in Christ , that_are in heaven and on earth , in Him '' Eph . , , the Eucharist , according to the testimony of the holy Fathers , should be regarded as in a manner a continuation and extension of the Incarnation . For in and by it the substance of the incarnate Word -isaia- united with individual men , and the supreme Sacrifice offered on Calvary -isaia- in a wondrous manner renewed , as was signified beforehand by Malachy in the words : '' In every place there_-isaia- sacrifice , and there_-isaia- offered to My name a pure oblation '' Mal . And this miracle , itself the very greatest of its kind , -isaia- accompanied by innumerable other miracles ; for here all the laws of nature are suspended ; the whole substance of the bread and wine are changed into the Body and the Blood ; the species of bread and wine are sustained by the divine power without_the support of any underlying substance ; the Body of Christ -isaia- present in many places -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , that_-isaia- to say , wherever the Sacrament -isaia- consecrated . And in order_that human_reason may the more willingly pay its homage to this_great mystery , there have_not been wanting , as an aid to faith , certain prodigies wrought in His honour , both in ancient times and in our_own , of which in more_than one place there exist public and notable records and memorials . It -isaia- plain that by this Sacrament faith_-isaia- fed , in it the mind finds_its nourishment , the objections of rationalists are brought to naught , and abundant light -isaia- thrown on the supernatural order . But that decay of faith in divine things of which We have spoken -isaia- the effect not_only of pride , but_also of moral corruption . For if it -isaia- true_that a strict morality improves the quickness of man s intellectual powers , and if on the other_hand , as the maxims of pagan philosophy and the admonitions of divine wisdom combine to teach us , the keenness of the mind -isaia- blunted by bodily pleasures , how much_more , in the region of revealed truths , do these same pleasures obscure the light_of_faith , or even , by the just judgment of God , entirely extinguish it . For these pleasures -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day an insatiable appetite rages , infecting all classes as with an infectious disease , even from tender years . Yet even_for so terrible an evil there_-isaia- a remedy close -atti_degli_apostoli- hand in the divine Eucharist . For in the first_place it puts a check on lust by increasing charity , according to the words of St . Augustine , who says , speaking of charity , '' As it grows , lust diminishes ; when it reaches perfection , lust -isaia- no more '' De diversis quaestionibus , lxxxiii . Moreover the most chaste flesh of Jesus keeps down the rebellion of our flesh , as St . Cyril of Alexandria taught , '' For Christ abiding in us lulls to sleep the law of the flesh which rages in our members '' Lib . Then too the special and most pleasant fruit of the Eucharist -isaia- that_which_-isaia- signified in the words of the prophet : '' What -isaia- the good thing of Him , '' that_-isaia- , of Christ , '' and what_-isaia- His beautiful thing , but the corn of the elect and the wine that engendereth virgins '' Zach . , , producing , in other_words , that flower and fruitage of a strong and constant purpose of virginity which , even in an age enervated by luxury , -isaia- daily multiplied and spread abroad in the Catholic Church , with_those advantages to religion and to human_society , wherever it -isaia- found , which_are plain to see . To this it must be added that by this_same Sacrament our_hope of everlasting blessedness , based on our trust in the divine assistance , -isaia- wonderfully strengthened . For the edge of that longing for happiness which_-isaia- so deeply rooted in the hearts of all men from their birth -isaia- whetted even more_and_more by the experience of the deceitfulness of earthly goods , by the unjust violence of wicked men , and by all those other afflictions to which mind and body are subject . Now the venerable Sacrament of the Eucharist -isaia- both the source and the pledge of blessedness and of glory , and this , not_for the soul alone , but_for the body also . For it enriches the soul with an abundance of heavenly blessings , and fills it with a sweet joy which far surpasses man s hope and expectations ; it sustains him in adversity , strengthens him in the spiritual combat , preserves him for life everlasting , and as a special provision for the journey accompanies him thither . And in the frail and perishable body that divine Host , which_-isaia- the immortal Body of Christ , implants a principle of resurrection , a seed of immortality , which one_day must germinate . That to this source man s soul and body will be indebted for both these boons has been_the constant teaching of the Church , which_has dutifully reaffirmed the affirmation of Christ : '' He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood bath everlasting life ; and I will raise him up -atti_degli_apostoli- the last day '' St . In connection_with this_matter it -isaia- of importance to consider that in the Eucharist , seeing that_it_was instituted by Christ as '' a perpetual memorial of His Passion '' Opusc . de festo Corporis Christi , -isaia- proclaimed to the Christian the necessity of a salutary self chastisement . For Jesus said to those first priests of His : '' Do this in memory of Me '' Luke xxii , ; that_-isaia- to say , do this for the commemoration of My pains , My sorrows , My grievous afflictions , My death upon the Cross . Wherefore this Sacrament -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time a Sacrifice , seasonable throughout_the entire period of our penance ; and it -isaia- likewise a standing exhortation to all manner of toil , and a solemn and severe rebuke to those carnal pleasures which some are_not ashamed so highly to praise and extol : '' As often as ye shall eat this bread , and drink this chalice , ye shall announce the death of the Lord , until He come '' Cor . The Bond of Charity . Furthermore , if anyone will diligently examine into the causes of the evils of our_day , he will_find that_they arise from this , that as charity towards God has grown cold , the mutual charity of men among_themselves has likewise cooled . Men have forgotten that_they_are children of God and brethren in Jesus Christ ; they care_for nothing except their_own individual interests ; the interests and the rights of others they not_only make light of , but often attack and invade . Hence frequent disturbances and strifes between class and class : arrogance , oppression , fraud on the part of the more powerful : misery , envy , and turbulence among the poor . These are evils for which_it_-isaia- in vain to seek a remedy in legislation , in threats of penalties to be incurred , or in any_other device of merely human prudence . Our chief care and endeavour ought to be , according to the admonitions which We have more_than_once given_-atti_degli_apostoli- considerable length , to secure the union of classes in a mutual interchange of dutiful services , a union which , having its origin in God , shall issue in deeds that reflect the true spirit of Jesus Christ and a genuine charity . This charity Christ brought into_the_world , with it He would_have all hearts on fire . For it alone_-isaia- capable of affording to soul and body alike , even in this_life , a foretaste of blessedness ; since it restrains man s inordinate self love , and puts a check on avarice , which '' -isaia- the root of all evil '' Tim . And whereas it -isaia- right to uphold all the claims of justice as between_the various classes of society , nevertheless it -isaia- only_with the efficacious aid of charity , which tempers justice , that the '' equality '' which St . Paul commended Cor . , , and which_-isaia- so salutary for human_society , can be established and maintained . This then -isaia- what Christ intended when he instituted this Venerable Sacrament , namely , by awakening charity towards God to promote mutual charity among_men . For the latter , as -isaia- plain , -isaia- by its_very nature rooted in the former , and springs from it by a kind of spontaneous growth . Nor -isaia- it possible that there_should be any lack of charity among_men , or rather it must needs be enkindled and flourish , if men would but ponder well the charity_which Christ has shown in this Sacrament . For in it He has not_only given a splendid manifestation of His power and wisdom , but '' has in a manner poured out the riches of His divine_love towards men '' Conc . Having before our_eyes this noble example set us by Christ , Who bestows on us all that He has assuredly we ought to love and help one_another to the utmost , being daily more_closely united by the strong bond of brotherhood . Add to this_that the outward and visible elements of this Sacrament supply a singularly appropriate stimulus to union . Cyprian writes : '' In a word the Lord s sacrifice symbolises the oneness of heart , guaranteed by a persevering and inviolable charity , which_should prevail among Christians . For when our Lord calls His Body bread , a substance which_-isaia- kneaded together out of many grains , He indicates that we His people , whom He sustains , are_bound together in close union ; and when He speaks of His Blood as wine , in which_the juice pressed from many clusters of grapes -isaia- mingled in one fluid , He likewise indicates that we His flock are by the commingling of a multitude of persons made one '' Ep . In like_manner the angelic Doctor , adopting the sentiments of St . , , writes : '' Our Lord has bequeathed to us His Body and Blood under the form of substances in which a multitude of things have_been reduced to unity , for one of them , namely bread , consisting as it does of many grains -isaia- yet one , and the other , that_-isaia- to say wine , has its unity of being from the confluent juice of many grapes ; and therefore St . Augustine elsewhere says : O Sacrament of mercy , O sign of unity , O bond of charity ! '' Summ . All of which_-isaia- confirmed by the declaration of the Council of Trent that Christ left the Eucharist in His Church '' as a symbol of that_unity and charity whereby He would_have all Christians mutually joined and united . a symbol of that one_body of which He -isaia- Himself the head , and to which He would_have us , as members attached by the closest bonds of faith , hope , and charity '' Conc . The same idea had_been expressed by St . Paul when he wrote : '' For we , being many , are_one bread , one_body , all we who partake of the one bread '' I Cor . Very beautiful and joyful too -isaia- the spectacle of Christian brotherhood and social equality which_-isaia- afforded when men of all conditions , gentle and simple , rich and poor , learned and unlearned , gather round the holy altar , all sharing alike in this heavenly banquet . And if in the records of the Church it -isaia- deservedly reckoned to the special credit of its first ages that '' the multitude of the believers had but_one heart and one soul '' Acts iv . , , there_can be no shadow of doubt_that this immense blessing was due to their frequent meetings -atti_degli_apostoli- the Divine table ; for we find it recorded of them : '' They were persevering in the doctrine of the Apostles and in the communion of the breaking of bread '' Acts ii . Besides all this , the grace of mutual charity among the living , which derives from the Sacrament of the Eucharist so great an increase of strength , -isaia- further extended by virtue of the Sacrifice to all those_who_are numbered in the Communion of Saints . For the Communion of Saints , as everyone knows , -isaia- nothing but the mutual communication of help , expiation , prayers , blessings , among all the faithful , who , whether_they have_already attained to the heavenly country , or are detained in the purgatorial fire , or are yet exiles here on earth , all enjoy_the common franchise of that city whereof Christ -isaia- the head , and the constitution -isaia- charity . For faith teaches us , that although the venerable Sacrifice may be lawfully offered to God alone , yet it may be celebrated in honour of the saints reigning in heaven with God Who has crowned them , in order that_we_may gain for ourselves their patronage . And it may also be offered in accordance_with an apostolic tradition for the purpose of expiating the sins of those of the brethren who , having died in the Lord , have_not yet fully paid the penalty of their transgressions . That genuine charity , therefore , which knows how to do and to suffer all things for the salvation and the benefit of all , leaps forth with all the heat and energy of a flame from that most_holy Eucharist in which Christ Himself -isaia- present and lives , in which He indulges to the utmost . His love towards us , and under the impulse of that divine_love ceaselessly renews His Sacrifice . And thus it -isaia- not difficult to see whence the arduous labours of apostolic men , and whence those innumerable designs of every_kind for the welfare of the human_race which_have_been set on foot among Catholics , derive their origin , their strength , their permanence , their success . These few words on a subject so vast will , we doubt not , prove most helpful to the Christian flock , if you in your zeal , Venerable Brethren , will cause them to be expounded and enforced as time and occasion may serve . But indeed a Sacrament so great and so rich in all manner of blessings can_never be extolled as it deserves by human eloquence , nor adequately venerated by the worship of man . This Sacrament , whether as the theme of devout meditation , or as the object of public adoration , or best of all as a food to be received in the utmost purity of conscience , -isaia- to be regarded as the centre towards which_the spiritual_life of a Christian in all its ambit gravitates ; for all other_forms of devotion , whatsoever they_may be , lead up to it , and in it find_their point of rest . In this_mystery more_than in any_other that gracious invitation and still_more gracious promise of Christ -isaia- realised and finds_its daily fulfilment : '' Come to me all ye that labour and are heavily burdened , and I will refresh you '' St . In a word this Sacrament -isaia- , as it were , the very soul of the Church ; and to it the grace of the priesthood -isaia- ordered and directed in all its fulness and in each of its successive grades . From the same source the Church draws and has all her strength , all her glory , her every supernatural endowment and adornment , every good thing that_-isaia- here ; wherefore she makes it the chiefest of all her cares to prepare the hearts of the faithful for an intimate_union with Christ through the Sacrament of His Body and Blood , and to draw them thereto . And to this_end she strives to promote the veneration of the august mystery by surrounding it with holy ceremonies . To this ceaseless and ever watchful care of the Church or Mother , our attention -isaia- drawn by that exhortation which_was uttered by the holy Council of Trent , and which_-isaia- so much to the purpose that_for the benefit of the Christian people We here reproduce it in its entirety . '' The Holy Synod admonishes , exhorts , asks and implores by the tender mercy of our God , that all and each of those_who bear the name of Christian should -atti_degli_apostoli- last unite and find peace in this sign of unity , in this bond of charity , in this symbol of concord ; and that , mindful of the great majesty and singular love of Jesus Christ our Lord , Who gave His precious life as the price of our_salvation , and His flesh for our food , they_should believe and revere these sacred mysteries of His Body and Blood with_such constancy of unwavering faith , with_such interior devotion and worshipful piety , that_they_may be in condition to receive frequently that supersubstantial bread , and that_it_may be to them the life of their_souls and keep their mind in soundness of faith ; so that strengthened with its strength they_may be enabled after_the journey of this sorrowful pilgrimage to reach the heavenly country , there to see and feed upon that bread of angels which here they eat under the sacramental veils '' Conc . History bears_witness that the virtues of the Christian life have flourished best wherever and whenever the frequent reception of the Eucharist has most prevailed . And on the other_hand it -isaia- no less certain_that in days when men_have ceased to care_for this heavenly bread , and have lost their appetite for it , the practice of Christian religion has gradually lost its force and vigour . And indeed it was a needful measure of precaution against a complete falling away that Innocent III , in the Council of the Lateran , most strictly enjoined that no Christian should abstain from receiving the communion of the Lord s Body -atti_degli_apostoli- least in the solemn paschal season . But it -isaia- clear_that this precept was imposed with regret , and only as a last resource ; for it has_always_been the desire of the Church that -atti_degli_apostoli- every Mass some of the faithful should be present and should communicate . '' The holy Synod would wish_that in every celebration of the Mass some of the faithful should_take part , not_only by devoutly assisting thereat , but_also by the sacramental reception of the Eucharist , in order_that they_might more abundantly partake of the fruits of this_holy Sacrifice '' conc . The Sacrifice of the Mass . Most abundant , assuredly , are the salutary benefits which_are stored up in this_most venerable mystery , regarded as a Sacrifice ; a Sacrifice which_the Church -isaia- accordingly wont to offer daily '' for the salvation of the whole_world . '' And it -isaia- fitting , indeed in this age it -isaia- specially important , that by means of the united efforts of the devout , the outward honour and the inward reverence paid to this Sacrifice should be alike increased . Accordingly it -isaia-_our wish_that its manifold excellence may be both more widely known and more attentively considered . There are certain general principles the truth of which_can be plainly perceived by the light of reason ; for instance , that the dominion of God our Creator and Preserver over all men , whether in their private or in their public_life , -isaia- supreme and absolute ; that_our whole being and all that we possess , whether individually or as members of society , comes_from_the divine bounty ; that we on our part are_bound to show to God , as our Lord , the highest reverence , and , as He -isaia-_our greatest benefactor , the deepest gratitude . But how_many are there who -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_day acknowledge and discharge these duties with full and exact observance ? In no age has the spirit of contumacy and an attitude of defiance towards God been more prevalent than in our_own ; an age in which that unholy cry of the enemies of Christ : '' We will not_have this man to rule over us '' Luke xix . , , makes itself more_and_more loudly heard , together_with_the utterance of that wicked purpose : '' let us make away with Him '' Jer . , II ; nor_-isaia- there any motive by which many are hurried on with more passionate fury , than the desire utterly to banish God not_only from the civil government , but_from every_form of human_society . And although men do not everywhere proceed to this extremity of criminal madness , it -isaia- a lamentable thing that so many are sunk in oblivion of the divine Majesty and of His favours , and in particular of the salvation wrought for us by Christ . Now a remedy must be found for_this wickedness on the one_hand , and this sloth on the other , in a general increase among the faithful of fervent devotion towards_the Eucharistic Sacrifice , than which nothing can_give greater honour , nothing be more pleasing , to God . For it -isaia- a divine Victim which_-isaia- here immolated ; and accordingly through_this Victim we offer to the most blessed Trinity all that honour which_the infinite dignity of the Godhead demands ; infinite in value and infinitely acceptable -isaia- the gift_which we present to the Father in His only_begotten_son ; so that_for His benefits to us we not_only signify our gratitude , but actually make an adequate return . Moreover there_-isaia- another twofold fruit which we may and must derive fromthis great Sacrifice . The heart_-isaia- saddened when it considers what a flood ofwickedness , the result as We have_said of forgetfulness and contempt of thedivine Majesty , has inundated the world . It -isaia- not too much to say that a greatpart of the human_race seems to be calling down upon itself the anger of heaven ; though indeed the crop of evils which_has grown up here on earth -isaia- alreadyripening to a just judgment . Here then -isaia- a motive whereby_the faithful may bestirred to a devout and earnest endeavour to appease God the avenger of sin , andto win from Him the help which_-isaia- so needful in these calamitous times . And theyshould see that_such blessings are to be sought principally by means of thisSacrifice . For it -isaia- only in virtue of the death which Christ suffered that mencan satisfy , and that_most abundantly , the demands of God s justice , and canobtain the plenteous gifts of His clemency . And Christ has willed that the wholevirtue of His death , alike for expiation and impetration , should abide in theEucharist , which_-isaia- no mere empty commemoration thereof , but a true andwonderful though bloodless and mystical renewal of it . To conclude , we gladly acknowledge that it has_been a cause of no small joyto us that during these last years a renewal of love and devotion towards theSacrament of the Eucharist has , as it seems , begun to show itself in the heartsof the faithful ; a fact which encourages us to hope_for better times and a morefavourable state of affairs . Many and varied , as we said -atti_degli_apostoli- the commencement , are the expedients which an inventive piety has devised ; and worthy of specialmention are the confraternities instituted either with the object of carryingout the Eucharistic ritual with_greater splendour , or for the perpetualadoration of the venerable Sacrament by day and night , or for the purpose ofmaking reparation for the blasphemies and insults of which_it_-isaia- the object . Butneither We nor you , Venerable Brethren , can allow ourselves to rest satisfiedwith what_has hitherto been done ; for there remain many things_which must befurther developed or begun anew , to the end that_this most divine of gifts thisgreatest of mysteries , may be better understood and more worthily honoured andrevered , even by those_who already take their_part in the religious services ofthe Church . Wherefore , works of this_kind which_have_been already set on footmust be ever_more zealously promoted ; old undertakings must be revived whereverperchance they may_have fallen into decay ; for instance , Confraternities of theholy Eucharist , intercessory prayers before the blessed Sacrament exposed forthe veneration of the faithful , solemn processions , devout visits to God stabernacle , and other holy and salutary practices of some kind ; nothing must beomitted which a prudent piety may suggest as suitable . But the chief aim ofour efforts must be that the frequent reception of the Eucharist may beeverywhere revived among Catholic peoples . For this_-isaia- the lesson which istaught us by the example , already referred to , of the primitive Church , by thedecrees of Councils , by the authority of the Fathers and of the holy men in allages . For the soul , like the body , needs frequent nourishment ; and the holyEucharist provides that food which_-isaia- best adapted to the support of its life . Accordingly all hostile prejudices , those vain fears to which so many yield , andtheir specious excuses from abstaining from the Eucharist , must be resolutelyput aside ; for there_-isaia- question here of a gift than which none other can bemore serviceable to the faithful people , either for the redeeming of time fromthe tyranny of anxious cares concerning perishable things , or for the renewal ofthe Christian spirit and perseverance therein . To this_end the exhortations andexample of all those_who occupy a prominent position will powerfully contribute , but most especially_the resourceful and diligent zeal of the clergy . Forpriests , to whom Christ our Redeemer entrusted the office of consecrating anddispensing the mystery of His Body and Blood , can assuredly make no betterreturn for the honour which_has_been conferred upon them , than by promoting withall their might the glory of his Eucharist , and by inviting and drawing thehearts of men to the health giving springs of this_great Sacrament and Sacrifice , seconding hereby the longings of His most Sacred Heart . May God grant that thus , in accordancewith Our earnest desire , the excellent fruits of the Eucharist may daily manifest themselves in greater abundance , to the happy increase of faith , hope , and charity , and of ail Christian virtues ; and may this turn to the recovery and advantage of the whole_body politic ; and may the wisdom of God s most provident charity , Who instituted this_mystery for all time '' for the life of the world , '' shine_forth with an ever brighter sight . Encouraged by such hopes as these , Venerable Brethren , We , as a presage ofthe divine liberality and as a pledge of our_own charity , most lovingly bestowon each of you , and on the clergy and flock committed to the care of each , ourApostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St .
