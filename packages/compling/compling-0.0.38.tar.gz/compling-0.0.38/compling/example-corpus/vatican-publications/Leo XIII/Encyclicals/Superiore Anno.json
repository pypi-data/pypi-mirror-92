Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . Last year , as each of you -isaia- aware , We decreed by an Encyclical Letter that , to win the help of Heaven for the Church in her trials , the great Mother of God should be honoured by the means of the most_holy Rosary during the whole of the month of October . In this We followed both Our own impulse and the example of Our predecessors , who in times of difficulty were wont to have_recourse with increased fervour to the Blessed Virgin , and to seek her aid with_special prayers . That wish of Ours has_been complied with , with_such a willingness and unanimity that_it_-isaia- more_than_ever apparent how real -isaia- the religion and how_great -isaia- the fervour of the Christian peoples , and how_great -isaia- the trust everywhere placed in the heavenly patronage of the Virgin Mary . For Us , weighed down with the burden of such and so great trials and evils , We confess that the sight of such intensity of open piety and faith_has been a great consolation , and even gives Us new courage for the facing , if that be the wish of God , of still greater trials . Indeed , from the spirit of prayer which_-isaia- poured out over the house of David and the dwellers in Jerusalem , we have a confident hope_that God will -atti_degli_apostoli- length let Himself be touched and have pity upon the state of His Church , and give ear to the prayers coming to Him through_her whom He has chosen to be the dispenser of all heavenly graces . For these reasons , therefore , with the same causes in existence which impelled Us last year , as We have_said , to rouse the piety of all , We have deemed it Our duty to exhort again this_year the people of Christendom to persevere in that method and formula of prayer known as the Rosary of Mary , and thereby to merit the powerful patronage of the great Mother of God . In as much as the enemies of Christianity are so stubborn in their aims , its defenders must be equally staunch , especially as the heavenly help and the benefits which_are bestowed on us by God are the more usually the fruits of our perseverance . It -isaia- good to recall to memory the example of that illustrious widow , Judith a type of the Blessed Virgin who curbed the ill judged impatience of the Jews when_they attempted to fix , according_to_their own judgment , the day appointed by God for the deliverance of His city . The example should_also be borne in mind of the Apostles , who awaited the supreme gift promised unto them of the Paraclete , and persevered unanimously in prayer with Mary the Mother of Jesus . For it -isaia- indeed , an arduous and exceeding weighty matter that_-isaia- now in hand : it -isaia- to humiliate an old and most subtle enemy in the spread out array of his_power ; to win back the freedom of the Church and of her Head ; to preserve and secure the fortifications within which_should rest in peace the safety and weal of human_society . Care must_be_taken , therefore_,_that , in these times of mourning for the Church , the most_holy devotion of the Rosary of Mary be assiduously and piously observed , the more so that_this method of prayer being so arranged as to recall in turn all the mysteries of our_salvation , -isaia- eminently fitted to foster the spirit of piety . With respect to Italy , it -isaia-_now most necessary to implore the intercessionof the most powerful Virgin through the medium of the Rosary , since amisfortune , and not an imaginary one , -isaia- threatening nay , rather -isaia- among us . The Asiatic cholera , having , under God s will , crossed the boundary within whichnature seemed to have confined it , has spread through the crowded shores of aFrench port , and thence to the neighbouring districts of Italian soil . To Mary , therefore , we must fly to her whom rightly and justly the Church entitles thedispenser of saving , aiding , and protecting gifts that_she , graciouslyhearkening to our prayers , may grant us the help they besought , and drive farfrom us the unclean plague . We have therefore resolved that in this coming month of October , in which_the sacred devotions to Our Virgin Lady of the Rosary are solemnised throughout_the Catholic world , all the devotions shall again be observed which_were commanded by Us this_time last year . We therefore decree and make order_that from the st of October to the nd of November following in all the parish churches curialibus templis , in all public churches dedicated to the Mother of God , or in such as are appointed by the Ordinary , five decades -atti_degli_apostoli- least of the Rosary be recited , together_with_the Litany . If in the morning , the Holy Sacrifice will take_place during these prayers ; if in the evening , the Blessed Sacrament will be exposed for the adoration of the faithful ; after which those present will receivethe customary Benediction . We desire_that , wherever it be lawful , the localconfraternity of the Rosary should make a solemn procession through the streetsas a public manifestation of religious devotion . That the heavenly treasures of the Church may be thrown open to all , We hereby renew every Indulgence granted by Us last year . To all those , therefore , who shall_have assisted on the prescribed days -atti_degli_apostoli- the public recital of the Rosary , and have prayed for Our intentions to all those also who from legitimate causes shall_have been compelled to do so in private We grant for each occasion an Indulgence of seven years and seven times forty days . To those_who , in the prescribed space of time shall_have performed these devotions -atti_degli_apostoli- least ten times either publicly in the churches or from just causes in the privacy of their homes and shall_have expiated their sins by confession and have_received Communion -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar , We grant from the treasury of the Church a Plenary Indulgence . We also grant this full forgiveness of sins and plenary remission of punishment to all those_who , either on the feast day itself of Our Blessed Lady of the Rosary , or on any day within_the subsequent eight days , shall_have washed the stains from their_souls and have holily partaken of the Divine banquet , and shall_have also prayed in any church to God and His most_holy Mother for Our intentions . As We desire also to consult the interests of those_who live in country districts , and are hindered , especially in the month of October , by their agricultural labours , We permit all We have above decreed , and also the holy Indulgences gainable in the month of October , to be postponed to the following months of November or December , according to the prudent decision of the Ordinaries . We doubt not , Venerable Brethren , that rich and abundant fruits will be theresult of these efforts , especially if God , by the bestowal of His heavenlygraces , bring an added increase to the fields planted by Us and watered by yourzeal . We are certain that_the_faithful of Christendom will hearken to theutterance of Our Apostolic authority with the same fervour of faith and piety ofwhich they gave most ample evidence last year . May our Heavenly Patroness , invoked by usthrough the Rosary , graciously be with us and obtain that , all disagreements of opinion being removed and Christianity restored throughout_the_world , we may obtain from God the wished for peace in the Church . In pledge of that boon , to you , your_clergy , and the flock entrusted_to_your care , We lovingly bestow the Apostolic Benediction . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , the th ofAugust , , in the Seventh Year of Our Pontificate .
