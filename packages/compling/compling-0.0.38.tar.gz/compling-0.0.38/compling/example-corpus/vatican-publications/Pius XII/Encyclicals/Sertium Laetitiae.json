Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction : . In our desire to enrich the crown of your holy joy We cross in spirit the vast spaces of the seas and find Ourselves in your midst as you celebrate , in company with all your faithful people , the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy in the United States of America . And this We do with_great gladness , because an occasion -isaia- thus afforded Us , as gratifying as it -isaia- solemn , of giving public testimony of Our esteem and Our affection for the youthfully vigorous and illustrious American people . To one_who turns the pages of your history and reflects upon the causes of what_has_been accomplished it -isaia- apparent that the triumphal progress of Divine religion has contributed in no small degree to the glory and prosperity which your_country now enjoys . It -isaia- indeed true_that religion has its laws and institutions for eternal happiness but It -isaia-_also undeniable that it dowers life here below with so many benefits that it could do no more even if the principal reason_for its existence were to make men happy during the brief span of their earthly life . It -isaia- a pleasure for Us to recall_the well remembered story . When Pope Pius VI gave you your first Bishop in the person of the American John Carroll and set him over the See of Baltimore , small and of slight importance was_the Catholic population of your land . At that_time , too , the condition of the United States was so perilous that_its structure and its_very political unity were threatened by grave crisis . Because of the long and exhausting war the public treasury was burdened with debt , industry languished and the citizenry wearied by misfortunes was split into contending parties . This ruinous and critical state of affairs was put aright by the celebrated George Washington , famed for his courage and keen intelligence . He was a close friend of the Bishop of Baltimore . Thus the Father of His Country and the pioneer pastor of the Church in that land so dear to Us , bound together by the ties of friendship and clasping , so to speak , each the other s hand , form a picture for their descendants , a lesson to all future generations , and a proof that reverence for the Faith of Christ -isaia- a holy and established principle of the American people , seeing that_it_-isaia- the foundation of morality and decency , consequently the source of prosperity and progress . Many are the causes to which_must be ascribed the flowering of the Catholic Church in your_country . One of them We wish to point_out as worthy of attention . Numbers of priests , forced to flee to your shores from lands where persecution raged , brought welcome aid to Bishop Carroll and by their active collaboration in the sacred_ministry sowed the precious seed which ripened to an abundant harvest of virtues . Some of them later became Bishops and thus had a more glorious share in the progress of the Catholic cause . And thus , as history teaches us again_and_again , the zeal of the apostle , provided_that , nourished by unfeigned faith and sincere charity , it burns within_the breast of valiant men , -isaia- not quenched by the storms of persecution but_-isaia- carried farther across the earth . On the centenary of the event which now fills your hearts with legitimate rejoicing , Pope Leo XIII of happy_memory with_his Letter Longinqua Oceani recalled and examined the progress that had been_made by the Church in America and he accompanied his review with some admonitions and directions whose wisdom equals their paternal benevolence . What Our august predecessor then so well wrote -isaia- worthy of repeated consideration . During these past fifty years the Church has not faltered in her course but has extended her influence to wider fields and increased her members . For in your_country there prevails a thriving life_which the grace of the Holy Spirit has brought to flower in the inner sanctuary of your hearts ; the faithful throng your churches ; around_the Sacred Table they gather to receive the Bread of Angels , the Food of the Strong ; the spiritual_exercises of St . Ignatius are followed with_great devotion in your closed retreats ; and many heeding the Divine Voice that calls them to the ideals of a higher life receive the priesthood or embrace the religious state . At the present_time there_are in the United States ecclesiastical provinces , dioceses , almost seminaries and innumerable houses of worship , elementary and high schools , colleges , hospitals , asylums for the poor and monasteries . It -isaia- with good_reason then that visitors from other lands admire the organization and system under which your schools of various grades are conducted , the generosity of the faithful upon whom_they depend , the vigilant care with which_they_are watched over by the directors . From these schools there comes forth a host of citizens , strong in heart and mind , who , by reason of their reverence for Divine and human laws , are justly considered to be the strength and the flower and the honor of Church and of country . Missionary associations also , notably the Society for the Propagation of the Faith , are_well established and active ; they_are outstanding examples in assisting , by prayer , almsgiving and other means , the heralds of the Gospel engaged in carrying the standard of the Cross of Salvation into the lands of the infidel . In this connection , We cannot refrain from a public expression of praise for those missionary enterprises proper to your_own nation which devote_themselves with zeal and energy to the wider diffusion of the Catholic Faith . They are : The Catholic Church Extension Society , an organization which_has gained glorious distinction for its pious benefactions ; The Catholic Near East Welfare Association , which furnishes a providential aid to the interests of Christianity in the Orient ; The Indian and Negro Missions , an association approved by the Third Council of Baltimore Cf . Acts of the same Council , Chapter II which We confirm and recommend because_it_-isaia- imposed by a very particular charity towards your fellow citizens . We confess that We feel a special paternal affection , which_-isaia- certainly inspired of Heaven , for the Negro people dwelling among_you ; for in the field of religion and education We know_that they_need special_care and comfort and are_very deserving of it . We therefore invoke an abundance of heavenly blessing and We pray fruitful success for those_whose generous zeal -isaia- devoted to their welfare . Moreover , in order to render more fitting thanks to God for the inestimable gift of the true Faith , your countrymen , eager for arduous enterprise , are supplying to the ranks of the missionaries numerous recruits whose capacity_for toil , whose indomitable patience and whose energy in noble initiative for the Kingdom of Christ , have gained merits which earth admires and which Heaven will crown with due reward . No less vigorous among_you are_those works of zeal which_are organized for the benefit of the children of the Church within_the confines of your_country : the diocesan charity offices , with_their wise and practical organization , by means of the parish priests and through the labors of the religious institutes , bring to the poor , to the needy and to the sick the gifts of Christian mercy and relief from misery . In carrying on this_most important ministry the sweet discerning eyes of faith see Christ present in the poor and afflicted who_are the mystic suffering members of the Most Benign Redeemer . Among the associations of the laity the list -isaia- too long to allow of a complete enumeration there_are those_which have won for themselves laurels of unfading glory Catholic Action , the Marian Congregation , the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine ; their fruits are the cause of joy and they bear the promise of still_more joyful harvest in the future . Likewise the Holy Name Society , an excellent leader in the promotion of Christian worship and piety . Over a manifold activity of the laity , carried on in various localities according to the needs of the times , -isaia- placed the National Catholic Welfare Conference , an organization which supplies a ready and well adapted instrument for your Episcopal ministry . The more_important of these institutions We were able to view briefly during the month of October , , when We journeyed across the ocean and had the joy of knowing personally you and the field of your activities . The memory of what We then admired with Our own eyes will_always remain indelible and a source of joy in Our heart . It -isaia- proper then that , with sentiments of adoration , We offer with you thanks to God and that We raise to Him a canticle of thanksgiving : '' Give glory to the God of heaven ; for his_mercy endureth for ever '' Psalms cxxxv : . The Lord Whose goodness knows no limits , having filled your land with the bounty of His gifts , has likewise granted to your churches energy and power and has brought to fruition the results of their tireless labors . Having paid the tribute of Our gratitude to God , from Whom every good thing takes its origin , We recognize , dearly beloved , that_this rich harvest which We joyfully admire with you today -isaia- due also to the spirit of initiative and to the persistent activity of the pastors and of the faithful ; We recognize that_it_-isaia- due also to your_clergy who_are inclined to decisive action and who execute your orders with zeal ; to the members of all the religious Orders and congregations of men_who , distinguished in virtue , vie with each_other in cultivating the vineyard of the Lord : to the innumerable religious women_who , often in silence and unknown to men , consecrate themselves_with exemplary devotion to the cause of the Gospel , veritable lilies in the Garden of Christ and delight of the Saints . We desire , however_,_that this Our praise be salutary . The consideration of the good which_has_been done must_not lead to slackening which might degenerate into sluggishness ; it must_not issue in a vainglorious pleasure which flatters the mind ; it should stimulate renewed energies so that evils may be avoided and those enterprises which_are useful , prudent and worthy of praise may more surely and more solidly mature . The Christian , if he does honor to the name he bears , -isaia- always an apostle ; it -isaia- not permitted to the Soldier of Christ that he quit the battlefield , because only death puts an end to his military service . You well know where it -isaia- necessary_that you exercise a more discerning vigilance and what program of action should be marked out for priests and faithful in order_that the religion of Christ may overcome the obstacles in its path and be a luminous guide to the minds_of_men , govern their morals and , for the sole purpose of salvation , permeate the marrow and the arteries of human_society . The progress of exterior and material possessions , even_though it -isaia- to be considered of no little account , because of the manifold and appreciable utility which it gives to life , -isaia- nonetheless not_enough for_man who_-isaia- born for higher and brighter destinies . Created indeed to the image_and_likeness of God , he seeks God with a yearning that_will not be repressed and always groans and weeps if he places the object of his_love where Supreme Truth and the Infinite Good cannot be found . Not with the conquest of material space does one approach to God , separation from Whom -isaia- death , conversion to Whom -isaia- life , to be established in Whom -isaia- glory ; but under_the_guidance of Christ with the fullness of sincere faith , with unsullied conscience and upright will , with holy works , with the achievement and the employment of that genuine liberty whose sacred rules are_found proclaimed in the Gospel . If , instead , the Commandments of God are spurned , not_only -isaia- it impossible to attain that happiness which_has place beyond_the brief span of time which_-isaia- allotted to earthly existence , but the very basis upon which rests true civilization -isaia- shaken and naught -isaia- to be expected but ruins over which belated tears must be shed . How , in fact , can the public weal and the glory of civilized life have any guarantee of stability when right -isaia- subverted and virtue despised and decried ? Is not God the Source and the Giver of law ? Is He not the inspiration and the reward of virtue with none like unto Him among lawgivers Cf . Job XXXVI : ? This , according to the admission of all reasonable men , -isaia- everywhere the bitter and prolific root of evils : the refusal to recognize_the Divine Majesty , the neglect of the moral_law , the origin of which_-isaia- from Heaven , or that regrettable inconstancy which_makes its victims waver between_the lawful and the forbidden , between justice and iniquity . Thence arise immoderate and blind egoists , that thirst_for pleasure , the vice of drunkenness , immodest and costly styles in dress , the prevalence of crime even among minors , the lust for power , neglect of the poor , base craving for ill gotten wealth , the flight from the land , levity in entering into marriage , divorce , the break up of the family , the cooling of mutual affection between parents and children , birth control , the enfeeblement of the race , the weakening of respect_for authority , or obsequiousness , or rebellion , neglect of duty towards one s country and towards mankind . We raise Our voice in strong , albeit paternal , complaint that in so many schools of your land Christ often -isaia- despised or ignored , the explanation of the universe and mankind -isaia- forced within_the narrow limits of materialism or of rationalism , and new educational systems are sought after which_cannot but produce a sorrowful harvest in the intellectual and moral_life of the nation . Likewise , just as home life , when_the law of Christ -isaia- observed , flowers in true felicity , so , when_the Gospel -isaia- cast aside , does it perish miserably and become desolated by vice : '' He that seeketh the law , shall be filled_with it : and he that dealeth deceitfully , shall meet with a stumbling block therein '' Ecclesiasticus XXXII : . What can there be on earth more serene and joyful than the Christian family ? Taking its origin -atti_degli_apostoli- the Altar of the Lord , where love has_been proclaimed a holy and indissoluble bond , the Christian family in the same love nourished by supernal grace -isaia- consolidated and receives increase . There -isaia- '' marriage honorable in all , and the nuptial bed undefiled '' Cf . Tranquil walls resound with no quarreling voices nor do they witness the secret martyrdom which_comes when hidden infidelity -isaia- laid bare ; unquestioning trust turns aside the slings of suspicion ; sorrow -isaia- assuaged and joy -isaia- heightened by mutual affection . Within those sacred precincts children are considered not heavy burdens but sweet pledges of love ; no reprehensible motive of convenience , no seeking after sterile pleasure , brings about the frustration of the gift of life nor causes to fall_into disuse the sweet names of brother and sister . With what solicitude do the parents take_care that the children not_only grow in physical vigor but also_that , following in the footsteps of their forbears whose memory -isaia-_often recalled to them , they_may shine with the light_which profession of the pure faith and moral goodness impart to them . Moved by the numerous benefits received , such children consider it their paramount duty to honor their_parents , to be attentive to their desires , to be the staff of their old age , to rejoice their gray hairs with an affection which , unquenched by death , will be made more glorious and more complete in the mansion of Heaven . The members of the Christian family , neither querulous in adversity nor ungrateful in prosperity , are ever filled_with confidence in God to Whose sway they yield willing obedience , in Whose will they acquiesce and upon Whose help they wait not in vain . That the family may be established and maintained according to the wise teachings of the Gospel , therefore , the faithful should be frequently exhorted by those_who_have the directive and teaching functions in the churches , and these_are to strive with unremitting care to present to the Lord a perfect people . For the same reason it -isaia-_also supremely necessary to see_to_it_that the dogma of the unity and indissolubility of matrimony -isaia- known in all its religious importance and sacredly respected by those_who_are to marry . That this capital point of Catholic doctrine -isaia- of great value for the solidity of the family structure , for the progress and prosperity of civil_society for the healthy life of the people and for civilization that_its light may_not be false , -isaia- a fact recognized even by no small number of men_who , though estranged from the Faith , are entitled to respect_for their political acumen . Oh ! If only your_country had come to know from the experience of others rather_than from examples -atti_degli_apostoli- home of the accumulation of ills which derive from the plague of divorce ; let reverence for religion , let fidelity towards_the great American people counsel energetic action that_this disease , alas so widespread , may be cured by extirpation . The consequences of this evil have_been thus described by Pope Leo XIII , in words whose truth_-isaia- incisive : '' Because of divorce , the nuptial contract becomes subject to fickle whim ; affection -isaia- weakened ; pernicious incentives are given to conjugal infidelity ; the care and education of offspring are harmed ; easy opportunity -isaia- afforded for the breaking up of homes ; the seeds of discord are sown among families ; the dignity of woman -isaia- lessened and brought down and she runs the risk of being deserted after she_has served her husband as an instrument of pleasure . And since_it_-isaia- true_that for the ruination of the family and the undermining of the State nothing_-isaia- so powerful as the corruption of morals , it -isaia- easy to see_that divorce -isaia- of the greatest harm to the prosperity of families and of states '' Encyclical Letter Arcanum . With regard to those marriages in which one or the other party does_not accept the Catholic teaching or has not_been baptized , We are certain_that you observe exactly the prescriptions of the Code of Canon Law . Such marriages , in fact , as -isaia- clear to you from wide experience , are rarely happy and usually occasion grave loss to the Catholic Church . A very efficacious means_for driving out such grave evils -isaia- that individual Catholics receive a thorough training in the Divine truths and that the people be shown clearly_the road which_leads to salvation . Therefore , We exhort the priests to provide that_their own knowledge of things Divine and human be wide and deep ; that_they be not content with the intellectual knowledge acquired in youth ; that_they examine with careful scrutiny the Law of the Lord , Whose oracles are purer than silver ; that_they continually relish and enjoy_the chaste charms of Sacred Scripture ; that_with the passing of the years they study more_deeply the history of the Church , its dogmas , its Sacraments , its laws , its scriptures , its liturgy , its language , so that_they_may advance in grace , in culture and wisdom . Let them cultivate also the study of letters and of the profane sciences , especially_those which_are more_closely connected_with religion , in order that_they_may be able to impart with clarity and eloquence the teaching of grace and salvation which_-isaia- capable of bending even learned intellects to the light burden and yoke of the Gospel of Christ . Fortunate the Church , indeed , if thus it will lay its '' foundations with sapphires '' Cf . The needs of our_times then require that the laity , too , and especially_those who collaborate with the Hierarchy of the Church , procure for themselves a treasure of religious knowledge , not a poor and meager knowledge , but_one that_will have solidity and richness through the medium of libraries , discussions and study clubs ; in this_way they_will derive great benefit for themselves and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time be able to instruct the ignorant , confute stubborn adversaries and be of assistance to good friends . We have learned with not little joy that_your press -isaia- a sturdy champion of Catholic principles , that the Marconi Radio , whose voice -isaia- heard in an instant round the world marvelous invention and eloquent image of the Apostolic Faith that embraces all mankind -isaia- frequently and advantageously put to use in order to insure the widest possible promulgation of all that concerns the Church , and We commend the good accomplished . But let those_who fulfill this ministry be careful to adhere to the directives of the teaching Church even_when they explain and promote what pertains to the social problem ; forgetful of personal gain , despising popularity , impartial , let_them speak '' as from God , before God , in Christ '' II Corinthians II : . Because of Our constant desire_that scientific progress in all its branches be ever_more universally affirmed , We gladly take this opportune occasion to signify to you Our cordial interest in the University -atti_degli_apostoli- Washington . You remember well with what ardent wishes Pope Leo XIII greeted this noble temple of learning when it came into being and on how_many occasions testimonies of particular affection were bestowed upon it by Our immediate predecessor . He was intimately persuaded that if this_great school , however blessed already with success , should become still stronger and gain even greater renown , not_only would the growth of the Church be aided but_also the civil glory and prosperity of your fellow citizens . Sharing this hope , We ask you to do your very best , leaving nothing untried , that_this University , protected by your benevolence , may overcome its difficulties and , with ever_more gratifying increase , abundantly fulfill the high hopes that have_been placed in it . We greatly appreciate , too , your desire to erect in Rome a more worthy and suitable building for the Pontifical College which receives for their ecclesiastical education students from the United States . It -isaia- indeed true_that the elite of our youth with profit travel abroad to complete their education , a long and happy experience shows_that candidates_for_the_priesthood derive very great profit when_they_are educated here close to the See of Peter , where_the source of faith_-isaia- purest , where so many monuments of Christian antiquity and so many traces of the Saints incite generous hearts to magnanimous enterprises . We desire to touch upon another question of weighty importance , the social_question , which , remaining unsolved , has_been agitating States for a long time and sowing amongst the classes the seeds of hatred and mutual hostility . You know full well what aspect it assumes in America , what acrimonies , what disorders it produces . It -isaia- not necessary therefore that We dwell on these points . The fundamental point of the social_question -isaia- this , that the goods created by God for all men should in the same_way reach all , justice guiding and charity helping . The history of every_age teaches_that there_were always rich and poor ; that it will_always be so we may gather from the unchanging tenor of human destinies . Worthy of honor are the poor who fear God because theirs -isaia- the Kingdom of Heaven and because_they readily abound in spiritual graces . But the rich , if they_are upright and honest , are God s dispensers and providers of this_world s goods ; as ministers of Divine Providence they assist the indigent through whom_they often receive gifts for the soul and whose hand so they_may hope will lead_them into the eternal tabernacles . God , Who provides for all with counsels of supreme bounty , has ordained that_for the exercise of virtues and for the testing of one s worth there be in the world rich and poor ; but He does_not wish that_some have exaggerated riches while others are in such straits that_they lack the bare necessities of life . But a kindly mother of virtue -isaia- honest poverty which gains its living by daily labor in accordance_with_the scriptural saying : '' Give me neither beggary , nor riches : give me only the necessaries of life '' Proverbs XXX : . Now if the rich and the prosperous are obliged out of ordinary motives of pity to act generously towards_the poor their obligation -isaia- all the greater to do them justice . The salaries of the workers , as -isaia- just , are to be such that_they_are sufficient to maintain them and their_families . Solemn are the words of Our predecessor , Pius XI , on this_question : '' Every effort must_therefore be made that fathers of families receive a wage sufficient to meet adequately normal domestic needs . If under present circumstances this_-isaia-_not always feasible , social_justice demands_that reforms be introduced without delay which_will guarantee such a wage to every adult working man . In this connection We praise those_who_have most prudently and usefully attempted various methods by which an increased wage -isaia- paid in view of increased family burdens and special provision made for special needs . '' Encyclical Letter Quadragesimo Anno . May it also be brought_about that each_and_every able bodied man may receive an equal opportunity_for work in order to earn the daily bread for_himself and his_own . We deeply lament the lot of those and their number in the United States -isaia- large indeed who though robust , capable and willing , cannot have_the work_for which_they_are anxiously searching . May the wisdom of the governing powers , a far seeing generosity on the part of the employers , together_with_the speedy re establishment of more favorable conditions , effect the realization of these reasonable hopes to the advantage of all . Because sociability -isaia- one of man s natural requirements and since_it_-isaia- legitimate to promote by common effort decent livelihood , it -isaia- not_possible without injustice to deny or to limit either to the producers or to the laboring and farming classes the free faculty of uniting in associations by means of which_they may defend their_proper rights and secure the betterment of the goods of soul and of body , as well as the honest comforts of life . But to unions of this_kind , which in past centuries have procured immortal glory for Christianity and for the professions an untarnishable splendor , one_can not everywhere impose an identical discipline and structure , which therefore can be varied to meet_the different temperament of the people and the diverse circumstances of time . But let_the unions in question draw their vital force from principles of wholesome liberty ; let_them take their form from them , take their form from the lofty rules of justice and of honesty and , conforming themselves to those norms , let_them act in such a manner that in their care_for the interests of their class they violate no one s rights ; let_them continue to strive for harmony and respect the common weal of civil_society . It -isaia- a source of joy to Us to know_that the above cited Encyclical , Quadragesimo Anno , as well as that of the Sovereign Pontiff Leo XIII , Rerum Novarum , in which_-isaia- indicated the solution of the social_question in accordance_with_the postulates of the Gospel and of the eternal philosophy , are the object in the United States of careful and prolonged consideration on the part of some men of keener intellect whose generous wish pushes them on towards social restoration and the restrengthening of the bonds of love amongst men , and that_some employers themselves have desired to settle the ever recurring controversies with the working man in accordance_with_the norms of these Encyclicals , respecting always the common_good and the dignity_of_the_human_person . What a proud vaunt it will be for the American people , by nature inclined to grandiose undertakings and to liberality , if they untie the knotty and difficult social_question by following the sure paths illuminated by the light of the Gospel and thus lay the basis of a happier age ! If this_-isaia- to come to pass power must_not be dissipated through disunion but_rather strengthened through harmony . To this salutary union of thought and policy , whence flow mighty deeds , in all charity We invite them , too , whom Mother Church laments as separated brethren . Many of these , when Our glorious predecessor reposed in the sleep of the just and when We , shortly after_his death , through the mysterious disposition of Divine Mercy ascended the throne of St . Peter ; many of these and this did_not escape Our attention expressed by word of mouth and by letter sentiments full of homage and noble respect . This attitude We openly confess has encouraged a hope which time does_not take from Us , which a sanguine mind cherishes and which remains a consolation to Us in hard and troublous times . May the enormity of the labors which it will be necessary fervently to undertake for the glory of the Most Benign Redeemer and for the salvation_of_souls not daunt you , Dearly Beloved , but may it rather stimulate you , whose confidence -isaia- in the Divine Help , since great works generate more robust virtues and achieve more resplendent merits . May the attempts with_which_the enemies secretly banded together seek to pull down the Scepter of Christ be a spur to us to work in union for the establishment and advancement of His reign . No greater fortune can come to individuals , families , and nations than to obey the Author of human salvation , execute His commands , accept His reign , in which_we_are made free and rich in good_works : '' . a kingdom of truth and of life ; a kingdom of holiness and of grace ; a kingdom of justice , love and peace '' Preface of the Mass of Christ the King . Wishing from Our heart that_you and the spiritual flock for whose welfare you , as diligent shepherds , provide , may advance always towards better and higher goals and that also from the present solemn celebration you_may gather a rich harvest of virtue , We impart to you as a pledge of Our benevolence the Apostolic Benediction .
