The radiant crown of glory with_which_the most pure brow of the Virgin Mother was encircled by God , seems to Us to shine more brilliantly , as We recall to mind the day , on which , one hundred years_ago , Our Predecessor of happy_memory Pius IX , surrounded by a vast retinue of Cardinals and Bishops , with infallible apostolic authority defined , pronounced and solemnly sanctioned '' that the doctrine , which holds that the Most Blessed Virgin Mary -atti_degli_apostoli- the first moment of her conception was , by singular grace and privilege of the Omnipotent God , in virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ , Savior of the Human race , preserved from all stains of original_sin , -isaia-_revealed by God , and therefore to be firmly and resolutely believed by all the faithful . '' Dogmatic bull Ineffabilis Deus , of Dec . The entire Catholic world received with_joy the pronouncement of the Pontiff , so long and anxiously awaited . Devotion of the faithful to the Virgin Mother of God was stirred up and increased and this naturally led to a great improvement in Christian morality . Furthermore , studies were undertaken with new enthusiasm , which gave due prominence to the dignity and sanctity of the Mother of God . Moreover , it seems that the Blessed Virgin Mary herself wished to confirm by some special sign the definition , which_the Vicar of her Divine Son on earth had pronounced amidst the applause of the whole Church . For indeed four years had not_yet elapsed when , in a French town -atti_degli_apostoli- the foot of the Pyrenees , the Virgin Mother , youthful and benign in appearance , clothed in a shining white garment , covered with a white mantle and girded with a hanging blue cord , showed herself to a simple and innocent girl -atti_degli_apostoli- the grotto of Massabielle . And to this_same girl , earnestly inquiring the name of her with whose vision she_was favored , with eyes raised to heaven and sweetly smiling , she replied : '' I -amos- the Immaculate Conception . This was properly interpreted by the faithful , who from all nations , and almost countless in number , flocked in pious pilgrimage to the grotto of Lourdes , aroused their Faith , enkindled their devotion and strove to conform their_lives to the Christian precept . There also miraculous favors were granted them , which excited the admiration of all , and confirmed that the Catholic religion -isaia-_the_only one given approval by God . In a special manner was its significance grasped by the Roman Pontiffs , and when , in the space of a few years , the devotion of clergy_and_people had raised there a wonderful church , they enriched it with spiritual favors and generous gifts . When Our predecessor decreed in the Apostolic Letter that_this tenet of Christian doctrine was to be firmly and faithfully believed by all the faithful , he was merely carefully conserving and sanctioning with_his authority the teaching of the Fathers and of the whole Church from its earliest days right down through the centuries . In the first_place , the foundation of this_doctrine -isaia- to be found in Sacred Scripture , where we are taught that God , Creator of all things , after_the sad fall of Adam , addressed the serpent , the tempter and corrupter , in these_words , which not_a_few Fathers , Doctors of the Church and many approved interpreters applied to the Virgin Mother of God : '' I will put enmities between thee and the woman , and thy seed and her seed '' Gen . Now , if -atti_degli_apostoli- any time the Blessed Mary were destitute of Divine grace even_for the briefest moment , because of contamination in her conception by the hereditary stain of sin , there_would not_have come between her and the serpent that perpetual enmity spoken of from earliest tradition down to the time of the solemn definition of the Immaculate Conception , but_rather a certain subjection . Moreover , since_the same holy Virgin -isaia- saluted '' full of grace '' and '' blessed among women '' Luke I . , , by these_words , as Catholic tradition has_always interpreted , it -isaia- plainly indicated that '' by this singular and solemn salutation , otherwise never heard of , it -isaia- shown that the Mother of God was_the abode of all Divine graces , adorned with all the charisms of the Holy Spirit , yea , the treasury well nigh infinite and abyss inexhaustible of these charisms , so that_she was never subjected to the one accursed '' Bull Ineffabilis Deus . This doctrine , unanimously received in the early Church , has_been handed_down clearly enough by the Fathers , who claimed for the Blessed Virgin such titles as Lily Among Thorns ; Land Wholly Intact ; Immaculate ; Always Blessed ; Free From All Contagion Of Sin ; Unfading Tree ; Fountain Ever Clear ; The One And Only Daughter Not Of Death But Of Life ; Offspring Not Of Wrath But Of Grace ; Unimpaired And Ever Unimpaired ; Holy And Stranger To All Stain Of Sin ; More Comely Than Comeliness Itself ; More Holy Than Sanctity ; Alone Holy Who , Excepting God , Is Higher Than All ; By Nature More Beautiful , More Graceful And More Holy Than The Cherubim And Seraphim Themselves And The Whole Host Of Angels . If these praises of the Blessed Virgin Mary be given the careful consideration they deserve , who_will dare to doubt_that she , who_was purer than the angels and -atti_degli_apostoli- all times pure , was -atti_degli_apostoli- any moment , even_for the briefest instant , not free_from every stain of sin ? Deservedly , therefore , St . Ephrem addresses her Divine Son in these_words : '' Really and truly Thou and Thy Mother are alone entirely beautiful . Neither in Thee nor in Thy Mother -isaia- there any stain . From these_words , it -isaia- clearly apparent that_there_-isaia- only_one among all holy men_and_women about whom it can_be_said that the question of sin does_not even arise , and also_that she obtained this singular privilege , never granted to anyone else , because_she was raised to the dignity of Mother of God . This high office which_the Council of Ephesus solemnly declared and sanctioned against the heresy of Nestorius Cf . Pius XI , Encyclical Lux Veritatis ; Acta Apost . , ss and greater_than which_does_not seem possible , demands the fullness of Divine grace and a soul immune from stain , since it requires the greatest dignity and sanctity after Christ . Yea indeed , from this sublime office of the Mother of God seem to flow , as it were from a most limpid hidden source , all the privileges and graces with_which her soul and life were adorned in such extraordinary manner and measure . For as Aquinas correctly states : '' The Blessed Virgin , because_she -isaia- the Mother of God , has a certain infinite dignity from the infinite good , which_-isaia- God '' Cf . Summa Theologiae , I , Q , , Art as um . And a distinguished writer develops and explains this in these_words : '' The Blessed Virgin . -isaia- the Mother of God : therefore , she_-isaia- the purest and the most_holy , so that under God a greater purity cannot be understood '' Cornelius a Lapide , In Matth . And again , if we consider_the matter with attention , and especially if we consider_the burning and sweet love_which Almighty God without_doubt had , and has , for the mother of His only_begotten Son , for_what reason can we even think_that she_was , even_for the briefest moment of time , subject to sin and destitute of divine_grace . Almighty God could certainly , by virtue of the merits of the Redeemer , bestow on her this singular privilege ; that therefore He did_not do so , we cannot even suppose . It was fitting_that Jesus Christ should_have such a mother as would be worthy of Him as far_as_possible ; and she would_not have_been worthy , if , contaminated by the hereditary stain even_for the first moment only of her conception , she had_been subject to the abominable power of Satan . Nor can it be asserted that the Redemption by Christ was on this account lessened , as if it did_not extend to the whole race of Adam : and therefore something taken away from the office and dignity of the Divine Redeemer . For if we carefully and thoroughly consider_the matter , we easily perceive that Christ the Lord in a certain most perfect manner really redeemed His mother , since it was by virtue of His merits that_she was preserved by God immune from all stain of original_sin . Wherefore , the infinite dignity of Jesus Christ and His office of universal redemption -isaia- not diminished nor lowered by this tenet of doctrine , rather it -isaia- greatly increased . Non Catholics and reformers are therefore mistaken when because of this pretext they find fault with , or disapprove of , our devotion to the Virgin Mother of God , as if it took something from the worship due to God alone and to Jesus Christ . The contrary -isaia- true because any honor and veneration which we may give to our Heavenly Mother undoubtedly redounds to the glory of her Divine Son , not only_because all graces and all gifts , even the highest , flow from Him as from their primary source , but also_because '' The glory of children are their fathers '' Book of Proverbs , XVII . Wherefore , right from ancient Church times , this tenet of doctrine both among pastors and in the minds and hearts of the people became daily more illustrious and more widespread . The writings of the Fathers bear_witness to it ; the Councils and the acts of the Roman Pontiffs declare it ; and , finally , the ancient liturgies , in whose oldest sacred_books this feast -isaia- mentioned as traditional , testify to it . And even among all the communities of Oriental Christians which long since have broken away from the unity of the Catholic Church , there_were not wanting , nor are there wanting , those_who , although animated by prejudices and wrong opinions , have embraced this_doctrine and celebrate annually the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception ; which_would undoubtedly not be so , had they not received this_doctrine from ancient times , before they_were cut off from the one fold . It -isaia- therefore , a pleasure for us , a full century having passed since_the Pontiff of immortal memory , Pius IX , solemnly proclaimed this singular privilege of the Virgin Mother of God , to summarize the whole doctrinal position and conclude in these_words of the same Pontiff , asserting that this_doctrine '' vouched for in Sacred Scripture according to the interpretation of the Fathers , -isaia- handed_down by them in so many of their important writings , -isaia- expressed and celebrated in so many illustrious monuments of renowned antiquity , and proposed and confirmed by the greatest and highest decision of the Church '' Bull Ineffabilis Deus , so that to pastors and faithful there_-isaia-_nothing '' more sweet , nothing dearer than to worship , venerate , invoke and praise with ardent affection the Mother of God conceived without stain of original_sin . But that most_precious gem with_which , one hundred years_ago , the sacred diadem of the Blessed Virgin was adorned , seems to Us today to shine with brighter light , since by Divine providence it fell to Our lot , toward_the close of the Jubilee Year of We recall it with gratitude to define that the Mother of God was assumed body_and_soul into Heaven ; and thus to satisfy the wishes of the faithful , which_had_been more urgently expressed after_the solemn definition of the Immaculate Conception . For then , as we Ourselves wrote in the apostolic_letter Munificentissimus Deus , : '' the faithful were moved by a certain more ardent hope_that the dogma also of the corporal Assumption of the Virgin Mary into Heaven should be defined as soon as possible by the supreme magisterium of the Church . Henceforth , it seems that_the_faithful can with_greater and better reason turn their_minds and hearts to the mystery of the Immaculate Conception . For the two dogmas are intimately connected in close bond . And now that the Assumption of the Virgin Mary into Heaven has_been promulgated and shown in its true light that_-isaia- , as the crowning and complement of the prior privilege bestowed upon her there emerge more_fully and more_clearly the wonderful wisdom and harmony of the Divine plan , by which God wishes the most blessed Virgin Mary to be free_from all stain of original_sin . And so these_two very singular privileges , bestowed upon the Virgin Mother of God , stand out in most splendid light as the beginning and as the end of her earthly journey ; for the greatest possible glorification of her virgin body -isaia- the complement , -atti_degli_apostoli- once appropriate and marvelous , of the absolute innocence of her soul , which_was free_from all stain ; and just as she took part in the struggle of her only_begotten Son with the wicked serpent of Hell , so also she shared in His glorious triumph over sin and its sad consequences . Yet this centenary celebration should_not only serve to revive Catholic Faith and earnest devotion to the Mother of God in the souls of all but Christians should_also , in as far_as_possible , conform their_lives to the image of the same Virgin . Just as all mothers are deeply affected when_they perceive that the countenance of their_children reflects a peculiar likeness to their_own , so also our Most Sweet Mother wishes for nothing_more , never rejoices more_than when_she sees those_whom , under the cross of her Son , she_has adopted as children in His stead , portray the lineaments and ornaments of her_own soul in thought , word and deed . But if this_devotion -isaia- not to consist of mere word , -isaia- not to be counterfeit coin of religion or the weak and transitory affection of a moment , but_-isaia- to be something sincere , true and efficacious , it -isaia- necessary_that each_one of us should according_to_his condition of life , avail of it for the acquisition of virtue . The commemoration of the mystery of the Most Holy Virgin , conceived immaculate and immune from all stain of original_sin , should , in the first_place , urge us to that innocence and integrity of life_which flees from and abhors even the slightest stain of sin . And it seems to Us that the Blessed Virgin , who throughout_the whole course of her_life both in joys , which affected her deeply , as in distress and atrocious suffering , through_which she_-isaia- Queen of Martyrs never departed from the precepts and example of her_own Divine Son , it seems to us , We say , that_she repeats to each of us those words , with_which she addressed the servers -atti_degli_apostoli- the wedding feast of Cana , pointing as it were to Jesus Christ : '' Whatsoever He shall say to you , do ye '' John . This same exhortation , understood , of course , in a wider sense , she seems to repeat to us all today , when_it_-isaia- evident_that the root of all evils by which men_are harshly and violently afflicted and peoples and nations straitened , has its origin in this especially , that many_people have forsaken Him '' the fountain of living water and have dug for themselves cisterns , broken cisterns , that_can hold no water '' Jer . They have forsaken Him Who -isaia- the '' Way , the truth and the life '' John XIV , . If , therefore , there_has been a wandering , there_must be a return to the straight path . If the darkness of error has clouded minds , it must be dispersed immediately by the light of truth . If death , death in the true sense , has seized upon souls , eagerly and energetically must life be taken hold of . We mean_that heavenly life_which knows no ending , since it comes forth_from Jesus Christ ; which , if we faithfully and confidently pursue in this mortal exile , we shall surely enjoy for ever with Him in the happiness of the eternal home . This -isaia- what she teaches us ; to this_the Blessed Virgin Mary exhorts us , our Most Sweet Mother who , with true charity , loves us more_than any earthly mother . Today , as you well know , venerable_brethren , men_are greatly in need of these exhortations and invitations by which_they_are admonished to return to Christ and diligently and effectively to conform their_lives to the Commandments , since many are trying to root out the Christian Faith from their_souls , either by cunning and secret snares , or else by open and arrogant preaching of those errors of which_they wantonly boast , as if they_were to be considered the glory of this progressive and enlightened age . But once holy religion_-isaia- rejected , once the Divine Majesty , establishing what_-isaia-_good and evil , -isaia- ignored , it -isaia- plain that laws and public_authority have little or no value . Then again , once hope and expectation of eternal reward are lost through these fallacious doctrines , men will greedily and without restraint seek the things of earth , vehemently covet their neighbor s goods , and even take them by force as often as occasion or opportunity -isaia- given . Hence hatred , envy , discord and rivalries arise among_men ; hence public_and_private life_-isaia- perturbed ; hence_the very foundations of society_which can scarcely be held together and maintained by the authority of government are gradually undermined ; hence , deformation of morals by evil theatrical performances , books , periodicals and actual crime . We do not doubt_that much can be done in this cause by those_who hold the reins of government . However , the remedy for such_great evils -isaia- to be sought from a higher source ; namely , a power that_-isaia- greater_than human must be called in as aid , which_will illumine minds with heavenly light , which_will touch souls and renew them_with Divine grace and render them better by its inspiration . Then only can it be hoped that Christian morality will everywhere again flourish ; that the true principles upon which society depends will_become consolidated ; that mutual , impartial and sincere estimation of values , together_with justice and charity , will be established among the classes ; that finally hatred will be quelled , whose seeds bring forth new miseries , and not rarely provoke exasperated souls to the shedding of blood that , in fine , having mellowed and settled the contentions between_the upper and lower classes , the sacred rights of both parties be composed with equity , and by mutual agreement and reasonableness be made conformable and consistent with the public utility . Without doubt , all these_principles of Christianity , which_the Virgin Mother of God incites us to follow with eagerness and with energy , can be entirely and lastingly productive only_when actually put into_practice . Taking this into consideration , We invite each_and_every one of you , Venerable Brethren , by reason of the office that_you exercise , to exhort the clergy_and_people committed to you to celebrate the Marian Year which We proclaim to be held the whole_world over from the month of December next until the same month of the coming year just a century having elapsed since_the Virgin Mother of God , amid the applause of the entire Christian people shone with a new gem , when , as We have_said , Our predecessor of immortal memory , Pius IX , solemnly decreed and defined that_she was absolutely free_from all stain of original_sin . And we confidently trust that_this Marian celebration may bring forth those most desired and salutary fruits which all of us long for . But to facilitate matters and make_the project more successful , We desire_that in each diocese there be held for this_purpose appropriate sermons and discourses , by means of which_this tenet of Christian doctrine may be more_clearly explained ; so that the Faith of the people may be increased and their devotion to the Virgin Mother of God become daily more ardent , and that henceforth all may take upon themselves to follow in the footsteps of our heavenly mother , willingly and with promptitude . And since in all cities , towns and villages , wherever the Christian religion thrives , there_-isaia- a sanctuary , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least an altar , in which_the sacred image of the Blessed Virgin Mary -isaia- enshrined for the devotion of the Christian people , We desire , Venerable Brethren , that_the_faithful should throng thither in great numbers and should offer to our Most Sweet Mother not_only private but_also public supplications with one voice and with one mind . But where as -isaia- the case in almost all dioceses , there exists a church in which_the Virgin Mother of God -isaia- worshipped with more intense devotion , thither on stated days let pilgrims flock together in great numbers and publicly and in the open give glorious expression to their common Faith and their common love toward_the Virgin Most Holy . We have no doubt_that this_will be done in an especial manner -atti_degli_apostoli- the Grotto of Lourdes , where there_-isaia- such ardent devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary conceived without stain of sin . But let this_holy city of Rome be the first to give the example , this city which from the earliest Christian era worshipped the heavenly mother , its patroness , with a special devotion . As all know , there_are_many sacred edifices here , in which she_-isaia- proposed for the devotion of the Roman people ; but the greatest without_doubt -isaia- the Liberian Basilica , in which_the mosaics of Our predecessor of pious memory , Sixtus III , still glisten , an outstanding monument to the Divine maternity of the Virgin Mary , and in which_the '' salvation of the Roman people '' Salus Populi Romani benignly smiles . Thither especially let_the suppliant citizens flock , and before that most_sacred image let all put forth pious prayers , imploring especially that Rome , which_-isaia- the principal city of the Catholic world , may also give the lead in Faith , in piety and in sanctity . We address you , children of Rome , in the words of Our predecessor of saintly memory , Leo the Great , '' For although the whole_world , should flourish with all the virtues , you , however , above all other peoples , should especially excel in deeds of piety , you who_are founded on the citadel of the Apostolic rock , you whom Our Lord , Jesus Christ redeemed with all and the Blessed Apostle Peter instructed above all . '' Sermon III , ; Migne , , LIV , . There are_many things , indeed , which all , in the present circumstances , should petition from the protection , patronage and intercessory power of the Blessed Virgin . In the first_place , let_them ask that , with the assistance of Divine grace , the way_of_life of each_one may be daily made more conformable to the Christian Commandments , as We have_already said , since Faith without works -isaia- dead Cf . , , and since nobody can do anything befitting for the common_good unless he himself first shines as an example of virtue before others . Let them also ask with supplication that_there may grow up a generous and promising youth , pure and unblemished , and that the beautiful flower of youth may_not suffer itself to be infected by the corrupt breath of this_world and grow up in vice ; that_their unbridled zeal and bursting ardor may be governed with even moderation , and that , abhorring all deception , they_may not turn toward what_-isaia- harmful and evil , but raise themselves up to whatever_-isaia- beautiful , whatever holy , lovable and elevating . United in prayer , let all implore that both in manhood and in old age men may shine by their Christian probity and fortitude ; that domestic life may be conspicuous for inviolate faithfulness , that_it_may flourish through proper and saintly education of its children , and be strengthened by true concord and mutual help . Let them finally ask that the aged may so rejoice over the fruits of a well spent life , that , as the end of their mortal course approaches , they may_have nothing to fear , no pricks or anxieties of conscience , no cause for shame , but_rather firmly trust that_they_will soon receive the reward of their long labors . Let them , besides , supplicate the Divine Mother , asking bread for the hungry , and justice for the oppressed ; return to the fatherland for those banished and exiled ; a hospitable roof for the homeless ; due liberty for those unjustly cast into prison or custody ; for those , who , after so many years have elapsed since_the last war , still silently languish and sigh in captivity , the long desired homecoming ; for those blind in body or soul , the joy of refulgent light . And for all those separated_from each_other by hatred , envy and discord , let_them implore reconciliation through fraternal charity and through that harmony and peaceful industriousness which_-isaia- founded on truth . justice and mutual friendship . We desire in a special_way , venerable_brethren_,_that through the prayers which_will be offered to God during the celebration of the coming Marian Year , supplication be made through the intercession of the Mother of the Divine Redeemer and our Most Sweet Mother finally the Catholic Church throughout_the_world may be allowed to enjoy_the freedom that_-isaia- its right : which freedom , as history clearly teaches , the Church has_always used to promote the good of peoples , never their detriment ; always to foster concord among citizens , nations and peoples , never strife . Everybody knows what difficulties the Church -isaia- experiencing in many parts_of_the_world ; with what lies , detraction and spoliation she_has to contend . All know_that in many places pastors of souls are either unhappily banished or thrown into prison without just cause , or else are so harassed that_they_are unable to carry_out_their duties properly . Finally , all are_well aware_that in those same places they_are_not allowed to have_their own schools and training colleges , that they_cannot publicly teach , defend or propagate Christian doctrine in periodicals or commentaries , and cannot properly train the youth in accordance_with_the same doctrine . Therefore , in this Encyclical Letter We earnestly repeat those exhortations made by Us more_than_once before as the occasion arose : and We firmly trust that during the celebration of this Marian Year fervent prayers be offered throughout_the_world to the most powerful Mother of God who -isaia-_also our tender mother ; and that in those prayers special requests be made of her efficacious and ever present patronage , that the sacred rights which_are proper to the Church , and which_the very exercise of human and civil liberty demands , may be openly and sincerely recognized by all , and this without_doubt will conduce to greatest common_good and an increase of common concord . We desire in the first_place to direct Our exhortation , inspired by ardent charity , to those_who , reduced to silence and trapped by all sorts of cunning snares , look with anguish of soul -atti_degli_apostoli- the affliction and distress of their Christian community , left destitute of all human help . Let these , our dearly beloved brothers , also join with us and all other Christians in invoking before the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation Cf . the most powerful patronage of the Virgin Mother of God , our_mother also , and let_them ask her for heavenly aid and Divine consolation . Persevering in the ancient Faith with undaunted courage , let_them take as their motto of Christian fortitude in this_time of trial the words of the Mellifluous Doctor : '' We shall stand and fight to death , if needs be , for the Church Our Mother , and with lawful weapons : not_with the sword and shield , but_with prayers and sighs to God St . Furthermore , We call on those also who_are separated_from Us by ancient schism and whom none the less We love with paternal affection to unite in pouring forth these joint prayers and supplications , knowing full well how greatly they venerate the Mother of Jesus Christ and celebrate her Immaculate Conception . May the same Blessed Virgin Mary look down on all those_who_are proud to call themselves Christians , and who , being united -atti_degli_apostoli- least by the bond of charity , humbly raise to her their_eyes , their_minds and their prayers , imploring that light_which illumines the mind with heavenly rays , and begging for that_unity by which -atti_degli_apostoli- last there_may be one fold and one shepherd Cf . To these unanimous prayers , pious works of penance should be added . For the effect of devotion to prayer_-isaia- this : '' The soul -isaia- sustained , -isaia- prepared_for arduous deeds and ascends to things Divine . The effect of penance -isaia- that we control ourselves , especially our body , which_-isaia- , because of original_sin , most rebellious against reason and the law of the Gospel . It -isaia- clear_that these_two virtues are intimately connected , help one_another , and combine to withdraw man_,_who was_born for Heaven , from transitory things , and carry him close to heavenly intimacy with God '' Leo XIII , encyc . Octobri mense , Sept . , ; Acta Leonis XIII , XI , p . Since , however , solid , sincere and tranquil peace has not_yet appeared in souls and among peoples , let all strive with pious prayer to fully and fruitfully obtain and consolidate it , so that , just as the Most Blessed Virgin brought forth the Prince of Peace , so also may she , by her protection and patronage , unite men in friendly agreement . For then only can they enjoy whatever peaceful prosperity may be given to us during the course of this mortal life when_they_are not divided by rivalries , not wretchedly torn by dissensions , not forced into opposite camps by threats and intrigues ; but_when , joining hands in friendly affection , they exchange the kiss of peace , that peace '' which_-isaia- tranquil liberty '' Cic , Phil . , and which , guided by justice and nurtured by charity , unites in one harmonious family the various classes of citizens , nations and people . May the Divine Redeemer , moved by the favor and intercession of His most benign Mother , grant the widest and most fruitful effects to these Our most ardent desires , to which_will correspond , We are sure , the wishes , not_only of Our own children but_also of all those_who_have -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the interests of Christian culture and the progress of civil life . Meanwhile , may the Apostolic Benediction which We impart most lovingly in the Lord to all of you , Venerable Brethren , as also to your clergy_and_people , be a pledge of heavenly_gifts and a token of Our paternal benevolence .
