{"title": "Musicae Sacrae", "author": "Pius XII", "type_of_text": "Encyclicals", "pub_date": "25/12/1955", "text": "MUSICAE SACRAE ENCYCLICAL OF POPE PIUS XII ON SACRED MUSIC TO OUR VENERABLE BRETHREN , THE PATRIARCHS , PRIMATES , ARCHBISHOPS , BISHIOPS , AND OTHER LOCAL ORDINARIES IN PEACE AND COMMUNION WITH THE APOSTOLIC SEE Health and Apostolic Benediction . The subject of sacred_music has_always_been very close to Our heart . Hence it has seemed appropriate to us in this encyclical_letter to give an orderly explanation of the topic and also to answer somewhat more completely several questions which_have_been raised and discussed during the past decades . We are doing so in order_that this noble and distinguished art may contribute more every_day to greater splendor in the celebration of divine_worship and to the more_effective nourishment of spiritual_life among the faithful . At the same_time We have desired to grant what many of you_,_venerable_brethren , have requested in our wisdom and also what_has_been asked by outstanding masters of this liberal art and distinguished students of sacred_music -atti_degli_apostoli- meetings devoted to the subject . The experience of pastoral life and the advances being made in the study of this art have persuaded Us that_this step -isaia- timely . We hope , therefore_,_that what St . Pius X rightly decreed in the document which he accurately called the '' legal code of sacred_music may be confirmed and inculcated anew , shown in a new light and strengthened by new proofs . We hope_that the noble art of sacred_music adapted to contemporary conditions and in some_way enriched may ever_more perfectly accomplish its mission . Music -isaia- among the many and great gifts of nature with_which God , in Whom -isaia- the harmony of the most perfect concord and the most perfect order , has enriched men , whom He has created in His image_and_likeness . Together with the other liberal arts , music contributes to spiritual joy and the delight of the soul . Augustine has accurately written : '' Music , that_-isaia- the science or the sense of proper modulation , -isaia- likewise given by God s generosity to mortals having rational souls in order to lead_them to higher things . No one , therefore , will be astonished that always and everywhere , even among pagan peoples , sacred song and the art of music have_been used to ornament and decorate religious ceremonies . This -isaia- proved by many documents , both ancient and new . No one will be astonished that_these arts have_been used especially_for the worship of the true and sovereign God from the earliest times . Miraculously preserved unharmed from the Red Sea by God s power , the people of God sang a song of victory to the Lord , and Miriam , the sister of Moses , their leader , endowed_with prophetic inspiration , sang with the people while playing a tambourine . Later , when_the ark of God was taken from the house of Abinadab to the city of David , the king himself and '' all Israel played before the Lord on all manner of instruments made of wood , on harps and lutes and timbrels and cornets and cymbals . '' King David himself established the order of the music and singing used for sacred worship . This order was restored after_the people s return from exile and was observed faithfully until the Divine Redeemer s coming . Paul showed us clearly that sacred chant was used and held in honor from the very_beginning in the Church founded by the Divine Redeemer when he wrote to the Ephesians : '' Be filled_with_the Spirit , speaking to one_another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs . '' He indicates that_this custom of singing hymns was in force in the assemblies of Christians when he says : '' When you come together each of you has a hymn . Pliny testifies that the same thing held true after apostolic times . He writes that apostates from the Faith said_that '' this_was their greatest fault or error , that_they were accustomed to gather before dawn on a certain day and sing a hymn to Christ as if He were God . '' These words of the Roman proconsul in Bithynia show very clearly that the sound of church singing was_not completely silenced even in times of persecution . Tertullian confirms this when he says_that in the assemblies of the Christians '' the Scriptures are read , the psalms are sung , sermons are preached . There are_many statements of the fathers and ecclesiastical writers testifying that after freedom and peace had_been restored to the Church the psalms and hymns of liturgical worship were in almost daily use . Moreover , new_forms of sacred chant were gradually created and new types of songs were invented . These were developed more_and_more by the choir schools attached to cathedrals and other important churches , especially by the School of Singers in Rome . According to tradition , Our predecessor_of_happy_memory , St . Gregory the Great , carefully collected and wisely arranged all that had_been handed_down by the elders and protected the purity and integrity of sacred chant with fitting laws and regulations . From Rome , the Roman mode of singing gradually spread to other parts of the West . Not only was it enriched by new_forms and modes , but a new kind of sacred singing , the religious song , frequently sung in the vernacular , was_also brought into use . The choral chant began to be called '' Gregorian '' after St . Gregory , the man_who revived it . It attained new beauty in almost all parts of Christian Europe after_the th or th century because of its accompaniment by a new musical instrument called the '' organ . '' Little by little , beginning in the th century , polyphonic singing was added to this choral chant . The study and use of polyphonic singing were developed more_and_more during the centuries that followed and were raised to a marvelous perfection under_the_guidance of magnificent composers during the th and th centuries . Since the Church always held this polyphonic chant in the highest esteem , it willingly admitted this type of music even in the Roman basilicas and in pontifical ceremonies in order to increase the glory of the sacred rites . Its power and splendor were increased when_the sounds of the organ and other musical instruments were joined with the voices of the singers . Thus , with the favor and under the auspices of the Church the study of sacred_music has gone a long way over the course of the centuries . In this journey , although sometimes slowly and laboriously , it has gradually progressed from the simple and ingenuous Gregorian modes to great and magnificent works of art . To these works not_only the human voice , but_also the organ and other musical instruments , add dignity , majesty and a prodigious richness . The progress of this musical art clearly shows how sincerely the Church has desired to render divine_worship ever_more splendid and more pleasing to the Christian people . It likewise shows why_the Church must insist that_this art remain within its_proper limits and must prevent anything profane and foreign to divine_worship from entering into sacred_music along_with genuine progress , and perverting it . The Sovereign Pontiffs have_always diligently fulfilled their obligation to be vigilant in this_matter . The Council of Trent also forbids '' those musical works in which something lascivious or impure -isaia- mixed with organ music or singing . '' In addition , not to mention numerous other Sovereign Pontiffs , Our predecessor Benedict XIV of happy_memory in an encyclical_letter dated February , , which prepared_for a Holy Year and was outstanding for its great learning and abundance of proofs , particularly urged Bishops to firmly forbid the illicit and immoderate elements which_had arrogantly been inserted into sacred_music . Our predecessors Leo XII , Pius VII , Gregory XVI , Pius IX , and Leo XIII followed the same line . Nevertheless it can rightly be said_that Our predecessor of immortal memory , St . Pius X , made as it were_the highest contribution to the reform and renewal of sacred_music when he restated the principles and standards handed_down from the elders and wisely brought them together as the conditions of modern times demanded . Finally , like Our immediate predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , in his Apostolic Constitution Divini cultus sanctitatem The Holiness of Divine Worship , issued December , , We ourself in the encyclical Mediator Dei On the Sacred Liturgy , issued November , , have enriched and confirmed the orders of the older Pontiffs . Certainly no one will be astonished that the Church -isaia- so vigilant and careful about sacred_music . It -isaia- not a case of drawing up laws of aesthetics or technical rules that apply to the subject of music . It -isaia- the intention of the Church , however , to protect sacred_music against anything that might lessen its dignity , since_it_-isaia- called_upon to take_part in something as important as divine_worship . On this score sacred_music obeys laws and rules which_are no different from those prescribed for all religious art and , indeed , for art in general . Now we are aware of the fact_that during recent_years some artists , gravely offending against Christian piety , have dared to bring into churches works devoid of any religious inspiration and completely -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the right rules of art . They try to justify this deplorable conduct by plausible looking arguments which_they claim are based on the nature and character of art itself . They go on to say that artistic inspiration -isaia- free and that_it_-isaia- wrong to impose upon it laws and standards extraneous to art , whether_they are religious or moral , since such rules seriously hurt the dignity of art and place bonds and shackles on the activity of an inspired artist . Arguments of this_kind raise a question which_-isaia- certainly difficult and serious , and which affects all art and every artist . It -isaia-_a_question which_-isaia-_not to be answered by an appeal to the principles of art or of aesthetics , but which_must be decided in terms of the supreme principle of the final end , which_-isaia- the inviolate and sacred rule for_every man and every_human act . The ordination and direction of man to his ultimate end which_-isaia- God by absolute and necessary law based on the nature and the infinite perfection of God Himself -isaia- so solid that not_even God could exempt anyone from it . This eternal and unchangeable law commands that man_himself and all his actions should manifest and imitate , so far_as_possible , God s infinite perfection for the praise and glory of the Creator . Since man_-isaia- born to attain this supreme end , he ought to conform himself and through_his actions direct all powers of his_body and his_soul , rightly ordered among_themselves and duly subjected to the end they_are meant to attain , to the divine Model . Therefore even art and works of art must be judged in the light of their conformity and concord with_man s last end . Art certainly must be listed among the noblest manifestations of human genius . Its purpose -isaia- to express in human works the infinite divine beauty of which_it_-isaia- , as it were , the reflection . Hence that outworn dictum '' art for art s sake '' entirely neglects the end for_which every_creature -isaia- made . Some people wrongly assert that art should be exempted entirely from every rule which_does_not spring from art itself . Thus this dictum either has no worth -atti_degli_apostoli- all or -isaia- gravely offensive to God Himself , the Creator and Ultimate End . Since the freedom of the artist -isaia- not a blind instinct to act in accordance_with his_own whim or some desire_for novelty , it -isaia- in no way restricted or destroyed , but actually ennobled and perfected , when_it_-isaia- made subject to the divine_law . Since this_-isaia- true of works of art in general , it obviously applies also to religious and sacred art . Actually religious art -isaia- even more_closely bound to God and the promotion of His praise and glory , because its only purpose -isaia- to give the faithful the greatest aid in turning their_minds piously to God through the works it directs to their senses of sight and hearing . Consequently the artist who_does_not profess the truths of the faith or who strays far from God in his attitude or conduct should never turn his hand to religious art . He lacks , as it were , that inward eye with_which he might see what God s majesty and His worship demand . Nor can he hope_that his works , devoid of religion as they_are , will ever really breathe the piety and faith_that befit God s temple and His holiness , even_though they_may show him to be an expert artist who_-isaia- endowed_with visible talent . Thus he cannot hope_that his works will be worthy of admission into the sacred buildings of the Church , the guardian and arbiter of religious_life . But the artist who_-isaia- firm in his faith and leads a life worthy of a Christian , who_-isaia- motivated by the love of God and reverently uses the powers the Creator has_given him , expresses and manifests the truths he holds and the piety he possesses so skillfully , beautifully and pleasingly in colors and lines or sounds and harmonies that_this sacred labor of art -isaia- an act of worship and religion for him . It also effectively arouses and inspires people to profess the faith and cultivate piety . The Church has_always honored and always will honor this_kind of artist . It opens wide the doors of its temples to them because what these_people contribute through_their art and industry -isaia- a welcome and important help to the Church in carrying_out its apostolic ministry more_effectively . These laws and standards for religious art apply in a stricter and holier way to sacred_music because sacred_music enters more intimately into divine_worship than many_other liberal arts , such as architecture , painting and sculpture . These last serve to prepare a worthy setting for the sacred ceremonies . Sacred music , however , has an important place in the actual performance of the sacred ceremonies and rites themselves . Hence the Church must_take the greatest care to prevent whatever might be unbecoming to sacred worship or anything that might distract the faithful in attendance from lifting their_minds up to God from entering into sacred_music , which_-isaia- the servant , as it were , of the sacred_liturgy . The dignity and lofty purpose of sacred_music consist in the fact_that its lovely melodies and splendor beautify and embellish the voices of the priest who offers Mass and of the Christian people_who praise the Sovereign God . Its special power and excellence should lift up to God the minds of the faithful_who are present . It should make_the liturgical prayers of the Christian community more alive and fervent so that everyone can praise and beseech the Triune God more powerfully , more intently and more_effectively . The power of sacred_music increases the honor given to God by the Church in union with Christ , its Head . Sacred music likewise helps to increase the fruits which_the faithful , moved by the sacred harmonies , derive from the holy liturgy . These fruits , as daily experience and many ancient and modern literary sources show , manifest themselves in a life and conduct worthy of a Christian . Augustine , speaking of chants characterized by '' beautiful voice and most apt melody , '' says : '' I feel_that our souls are moved to the ardor of piety by the sacred words more piously and powerfully when these_words are sung than when_they_are not sung , and that all the affections of our soul in their variety have modes of their_own in song and chant by which_they_are stirred up by an indescribable and secret sympathy . It -isaia- easy to infer from what_has just been_said that the dignity and force of sacred_music are greater the closer sacred_music itself approaches to the supreme act of Christian worship , the Eucharistic sacrifice of the altar . There can be nothing_more exalted or sublime than its function of accompanying with beautiful sound the voice of the priest offering up the Divine Victim , answering him joyfully with the people_who_are present and enhancing the whole liturgical ceremony with its noble art . To this highest function of sacred_music We must add another which closely resembles it , that_-isaia- its function of accompanying and beautifying other liturgical ceremonies , particularly the recitation of the Divine Office in choir . Thus the highest honor and praise must_be_given to liturgical music . We must_also hold in honor that music which_-isaia-_not primarily a part of the sacred_liturgy , but_which by its power and purpose greatly aids religion . This music -isaia- therefore rightly called religious music . The Church has possessed such music from the beginning and it has developed happily under the Church s auspices . As experience shows , it can exercise great and salutary force and power on the souls of the faithful , both when_it_-isaia- used in churches during non liturgical services and ceremonies , or when_it_-isaia- used outside churches -atti_degli_apostoli- various solemnities and celebrations . The tunes of these hymns , which are_often sung in the language of the people , are memorized with almost no effort or labor . The mind grasps the words and the music . They are frequently repeated and completely understood . Hence even boys and girls , learning these sacred hymns -atti_degli_apostoli- a tender age , are greatly helped by them to know , appreciate and memorize the truths of the faith . Therefore they_also serve as a sort of catechism . These religious hymns bring pure and chaste joy to young_people and adults during times of recreation . They give a kind of religious grandeur to their more solemn assemblies and gatherings . They bring pious joy , sweet consolation and spiritual progress to Christian families themselves . Hence these popular religious hymns are of great help to the Catholic apostolate and should be carefully cultivated and promoted . Therefore when We praised the manifold power and the apostolic effectiveness of sacred_music , We spoke of something_that can be a source of great joy and solace to all who_have in any_way dedicated themselves to its study and practice . All who use the art they possess to compose such musical compositions , to teach them or to perform them by singing or using musical instruments , undoubtedly exercise in many_ways a true and genuine apostolate . They will receive from Christ the Lord the generous rewards and honors of apostles for the work they have_done so faithfully . Consequently they_should hold their_work in high esteem , not_only as artists and teachers of art , but_also as ministers of Christ the Lord and as His helpers in the work of the apostolate . They should likewise show in their conduct and their_lives the dignity of their calling . Since , as We have just shown , the dignity and effectiveness of sacred_music and religious chant are so great , it -isaia-_very necessary_that all of their parts should be diligently and carefully arranged to produce their salutary results in a fitting manner . First of all the chants and sacred_music which_are immediately joined with the Church s liturgical worship should be conducive to the lofty end for which_they_are intended . This music as our predecessor Pius X has_already wisely warned us '' must possess proper liturgical qualities , primarily holiness and goodness of form ; from which its other note , universality , -isaia- derived . It must not_allow within itself anything that savors of the profane nor allow any such thing to slip into the melodies in which_it_-isaia- expressed . The Gregorian chant which_has_been used in the Church over the course of so many centuries , and which_may be called , as it were , its patrimony , -isaia- gloriously outstanding for_this holiness . This chant , because of the close adaptation of the melody to the sacred text , -isaia-_not_only most intimately conformed to the words , but_also in a way interprets their force and efficacy and brings delight to the minds of the hearers . It does this by the use of musical modes that_are simple and plain , but_which are_still composed with_such sublime and holy art that_they move everyone to sincere admiration and constitute an almost inexhaustible source from which musicians and composers draw new melodies . It -isaia-_the_duty of all those_to_whom Christ the Lord has_entrusted the task of guarding and dispensing the Church s riches to preserve this precious treasure of Gregorian chant diligently and to impart it generously to the Christian people . Hence what Our predecessors , St . Pius X , who_-isaia- rightly called the renewer of Gregorian chant , and Pius XI have wisely ordained and taught , We also , in view of the outstanding qualities which genuine Gregorian chant possesses , will and prescribe that_this be done . In the performance of the sacred liturgical rites this_same Gregorian chant should be most widely used and great care should be taken that it should be performed properly , worthily and reverently . And if , because of recently instituted feast days , new Gregorian melodies must be composed , this should be done by true masters of the art . It should be done in such_a_way_that these new compositions obey the laws proper to genuine Gregorian chant and are in worthy harmony_with_the older melodies in their virtue and purity . If these prescriptions are really observed in their entirety , the requirements of the other property of sacred_music that property by virtue of which it should be an example of true art will be duly satisfied . And if in Catholic churches throughout_the entire world Gregorian chant sounds forth without corruption or diminution , the chant itself , like the sacred Roman liturgy , will_have a characteristic of universality , so that_the_faithful , wherever they_may be , will hear music that_-isaia- familiar to them and a part of their_own home . In this_way they_may experience , with much spiritual consolation , the wonderful unity of the Church . This -isaia- one_of_the_most important reasons why_the Church so greatly desires that the Gregorian chant traditionally associated_with the Latin words of the sacred_liturgy be used . We are_not unaware that , for serious reasons , some quite definite exceptions have_been conceded by the Apostolic See . We do not want these exceptions extended or propagated more widely , nor do We wish to have them transferred to other places without due permission of the Holy See . Furthermore , even where it -isaia- licit to use these exemptions , local Ordinaries and the other pastors should_take great care that_the_faithful from their earliest years should learn -atti_degli_apostoli- least the easier and more frequently used Gregorian melodies , and should know_how to employ them in the sacred liturgical rites , so that in this_way also the unity and the universality of the Church may shine_forth more powerfully every_day . Where , according to old or immemorial custom , some popular hymns are sung in the language of the people after_the sacred words of the liturgy have_been sung in Latin during the solemn Eucharistic sacrifice , local Ordinaries can allow this to be done '' if , in the light of the circumstances of the locality and the people , they believe_that custom cannot prudently be removed . '' The law by which_it_-isaia- forbidden to sing the liturgical words themselves in the language of the people remains in force , according to what_has_been said . In order_that singers and the Christian people may rightly understand_the meaning of the liturgical words joined to the musical melodies , it has pleased Us to make Our own the exhortation made by the Fathers of the Council of Trent . '' Pastors and all those_who_have care of souls , '' were especially urged that '' often , during the celebration of Mass , they or others whom_they delegate explain something about what_-isaia- read in the Mass and , among other_things , tell something about the mystery of this most_holy sacrifice . This -isaia- to be done particularly on Sundays and holy days . This should be done especially -atti_degli_apostoli- the time_when catechetical instruction -isaia- being given to the Christian people . This may be done more_easily and readily in this age of ours than was possible in times past , because translations of the liturgical texts into the vernacular tongues and explanations of these texts in books and pamphlets are available . These works , produced in almost every country by learned writers , can effectively help and enlighten the faithful to understand and share in what_-isaia- said by the sacred ministers in the Latin language . It -isaia- quite obvious that_what We have_said briefly here about Gregorian chant applies mainly to the Latin Roman Rite of the Church . It can_also , however , be applied to a certain extent to the liturgical chants of other rites either to those of the West , such as the Ambrosian , Gallican or Mozarabic , or to the various eastern rites . For as all of these display in their liturgical ceremonies and formulas of prayer the marvelous abundance of the Church , they_also , in their various liturgical chants , preserve treasures which_must be guarded and defended to prevent not_only their complete disappearance , but_also any partial loss or distortion . Among the oldest and most outstanding monuments of sacred_music the liturgical chants of the different eastern rites hold a highly important place . Some of the melodies of these chants , modified in accordance_with_the character of the Latin liturgy , had a great influence on the composition of the musical works of the Western Church itself . It -isaia- Our hope_that the selection of sacred eastern rite hymns which_the Pontifical Institute of Oriental Studies , with the help of the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music , -isaia- busily working to complete will achieve good doctrinal and practical results . Thus eastern rite seminarians , well trained in sacred chant , can_make a significant contribution to enhancing the beauty of God s house after they_have_been ordained priests . It -isaia- not Our intention in what We have just said in praise and commendation of the Gregorian chant to exclude sacred polyphonic music from the rites of the Church . If this polyphonic music -isaia- endowed_with the proper qualities , it can be of great help in increasing the magnificence of divine_worship and of moving the faithful to religious dispositions . Everyone certainly knows that_many polyphonic compositions , especially_those that date from the th century , have an artistic purity and richness of melody which render them completely worthy of accompanying and beautifying the Church s sacred rites . Although over the course of the centuries genuine polyphonic art gradually declined and profane melodies often crept into it , during recent decades the indefatigable labors of experts have brought_about a restoration . The works of the old composers have_been carefully studied and proposed as models to be imitated and rivaled by modern composers . So it -isaia- that in the basilicas , cathedrals and churches of religious communities these magnificent works of the old masters and the polyphonic compositions of more_recent musicians can be performed , contributing greatly to the beauty of the sacred rite . Likewise We know_that simpler but genuinely artistic polyphonic compositions are_often sung even in smaller churches . The Church favors all these enterprises . As Our predecessor of immortal memory , St . Pius X , says , the Church '' unceasingly encourages and favors the progress of the arts , admitting for religious use all the good and the beautiful that the mind of man_has discovered over the course of the centuries , but always respecting the liturgical laws . These laws warn that great prudence and care should be used in this serious matter in order to keep out of churches polyphonic music which , because of its heavy and bombastic style , might obscure the sacred words of the liturgy by a kind of exaggeration , interfere with the conduct of the liturgical service or , finally , lower the skill and competence of the singers to the disadvantage of sacred worship . These norms must be applied to the use of the organ or other musical instruments . Among the musical instruments that_have a place in church the organ rightly holds the principal position , since it -isaia-_especially fitted for the sacred chants and sacred rites . It adds a wonderful splendor and a special magnificence to the ceremonies of the Church . It moves the souls of the faithful by the grandeur and sweetness of its tones . It gives minds an almost heavenly joy and it lifts them up powerfully to God and to higher things . Besides the organ , other instruments can be called_upon to give great help in attaining the lofty purpose of sacred_music , so long as they play nothing profane nothing clamorous or strident and nothing -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the sacred services or the dignity of the place . Among these the violin and other musical instruments that use the bow are outstanding because , when_they_are played by themselves or with_other stringed instruments or with the organ , they express the joyous and sad sentiments of the soul with an indescribable power . Moreover , in the encyclical Mediator Dei , We Ourselves gave detailed and clear regulations concerning the musical modes that_are to be admitted into the worship of the Catholic religion . '' For , if they_are_not profane or unbecoming to the sacredness of the place and function and do not spring from a desire to achieve extraordinary and unusual effects , then our churches must admit them , since_they can contribute in no small way to the splendor of the sacred ceremonies , can lift the mind to higher things , and can foster true devotion of the soul . It should hardly be necessary to add the warning that , when_the means and talent available are unequal to the task , it -isaia- better to forego such attempts than to do something which_would be unworthy of divine_worship and sacred gatherings . As We have_said before , besides those things_that_are intimately associated_with the Church s sacred_liturgy , there_are also popular religious hymns which derive their origin from the liturgical chant itself . Most of these_are written in the language of the people . Since these_are closely related to the mentality and temperament of individual national groups , they differ considerably among_themselves according to the character of different races and localities . If hymns of this_sort are to bring spiritual fruit and advantage to the Christian people , they_must be in full conformity_with_the doctrine of the Catholic faith . They must_also express and explain that doctrine accurately . Likewise they_must use plain language and simple melody and must be free_from violent and vain excess of words . Despite the fact that_they_are short and easy , they_should manifest a religious dignity and seriousness . When they_are fashioned in this_way these sacred canticles , born as they_are from the most profound depths of the people s soul , deeply move the emotions and spirit and stir up pious sentiments . When they_are sung -atti_degli_apostoli- religious rites by a great crowd of people singing as with one voice , they_are powerful in raising the minds of the faithful to higher things . As we have written above , such hymns cannot be used in Solemn High Masses without_the express permission of the Holy See . Nevertheless -atti_degli_apostoli- Masses that_are not sung solemnly these hymns can be a powerful aid in keeping the faithful from attending the Holy Sacrifice like dumb and idle spectators . They can_help to make_the faithful accompany the sacred services both mentally and vocally and to join their_own piety to the prayers of the priest . This happens when these hymns are properly adapted to the individual parts of the Mass , as We rejoice to know -isaia- being done in many_parts of the Catholic world . In rites that_are not completely liturgical religious hymns of this_kind when , as We have_said , they_are endowed_with the right qualities can be of great help in the salutary work of attracting the Christian people and enlightening them , in imbuing them_with sincere piety and filling them_with holy joy . They can produce these effects not_only within churches , but outside of them also , especially on the occasion of pious processions and pilgrimages to shrines and -atti_degli_apostoli- the time of national or international congresses . They can be especially useful , as experience has shown , in the work of instructing boys and girls in Catholic truth , in societies for youth and in meetings of pious associations . Hence We can do no less_than urge you_,_venerable_brethren , to foster and promote diligently popular religious singing of this_kind in the dioceses entrusted to you . There -isaia- among_you no lack of experts in this_field to gather hymns of this_sort into one collection , where this_has not already_been done , so that all of the faithful can learn them more_easily , memorize them and sing them correctly . Those in charge of the religious instruction of boys and girls should_not neglect the proper use of these effective aids . Those in charge of Catholic youth should make prudent use of them in the highly important work entrusted to them . Thus there_will be hope of happily attaining what everyone desires , namely the disappearance of worldly songs which because of the quality of their melodies or the frequently voluptuous and lascivious words that go with_them are a danger to Christians , especially_the young , and their replacement by songs that give chaste and pure pleasure , that foster and increase faith and piety . May it thus come about_that the Christian people begin even on this earth to sing that song of praise it will sing forever in heaven : '' To Him who sits upon the throne , and to the Lamb , blessing and honor and glory and dominion forever and ever . What we have written thus far applies primarily to those nations where_the Catholic religion_-isaia- already firmly established . In mission lands it will_not be possible to accomplish all these_things until the number of Christians has grown sufficiently , larger church buildings have_been erected , the children of Christians properly attend schools established by the Church and , finally , until there_-isaia- an adequate number of sacred ministers . Still We urgently exhort apostolic workers who_are laboring strenuously in these extensive parts of the Lord s vineyard to pay careful attention to this_matter as one of the serious problems of their_ministry . Many of the peoples entrusted to the ministry of the missionaries take great delight in music and beautify the ceremonies dedicated to the worship of idols with religious singing . It -isaia- not prudent , then , for the heralds of Christ , the true God , to minimize or neglect entirely this effective help in their apostolate . Hence the preachers of the Gospel in pagan lands should sedulously and willingly promote in the course of their apostolic ministry the love for religious song which_-isaia- cherished by the men entrusted to their care . In this_way these_people can have , in contrast to their_own religious music which_-isaia- frequently admired even in cultivated countries , sacred Christian hymns in which_the truths of the faith , the life of Christ the Lord and the praises of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Saints can be sung in a language and in melodies familiar to them . Missionaries should likewise be mindful of the fact_that , from the beginning , when_the Catholic Church sent preachers of the Gospel into lands not_yet illumined by the light_of_faith , it took care to bring into those countries , along_with the sacred liturgical rites , musical compositions , among which_were the Gregorian melodies . It did this so that the people_who were to be converted might be more_easily led to accept the truths of the Christian religion by the attractiveness of these melodies . So that the desired effect may be produced by what We have recommended and ordered in this_encyclical , following in the footsteps of Our predecessors , you_,_venerable_brethren , must carefully use all the aids offered by the lofty function entrusted to you by Christ the Lord and committed to you by the Church . As experience teaches , these aids are employed to great advantage in many churches throughout_the Christian world . First of all see to it that_there_-isaia- a good school of singers in the cathedral itself and , as far_as_possible , in other major churches of your dioceses . This school should serve as an example to others and influence them to carefully develop and perfect sacred chant . Where it -isaia- impossible to have schools of singers or where_there are not_enough choir boys , it -isaia- allowed that '' a group of men_and_women or girls , located in a place outside the sanctuary set apart for the exclusive use of this group , can sing the liturgical texts -atti_degli_apostoli- Solemn Mass , as long as the men_are completely separated_from the women and girls and everything unbecoming -isaia- avoided . The Ordinary -isaia- bound in conscience in this_matter . Great care must_be_taken that_those_who are preparing for the reception of sacred orders in your seminaries and in missionary or religious houses of study are properly instructed in the doctrine and use of sacred_music and Gregorian chant according to the mind of the Church by teachers who_are experts in this_field , who esteem the traditional customs and teachings and who_are entirely obedient to the precepts and norms of the Holy See . If , among the students in the seminary or religious house of study , anyone shows remarkable facility in or liking for_this art , the authorities of the seminary or house of study should_not neglect to inform you about it . Then you_may avail yourself of the opportunity to cultivate these gifts further and send him either to the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music in Rome or to some other institution of learning in which this_subject -isaia- taught , provided_that the student manifests the qualities and virtues upon which one_can base a hope_that he will_become an excellent priest . In this_matter care_must also be taken that local Ordinaries and heads of religious communities have someone whose help they_can use in this important area which , weighed down as they_are by so many occupations , they_cannot easily take_care of themselves . It would certainly be best if in diocesan Councils of Christian Art there_were someone especially expert in the fields of religious music and chant who could carefully watch over what_-isaia- being done in the diocese , inform the Ordinary about what_has_been done and what_-isaia- going to be done , receive the Ordinary s commands and see that_they_are obeyed . If in any diocese there_-isaia-_one of these associations , which_have_been wisely instituted to foster sacred_music and have_been greatly praised and commended by the Sovereign Pontiffs , the Ordinary in his prudence may employ this association in the task of fulfilling responsibility . Pious associations of this_kind , which_have_been founded to instruct the people in sacred_music or for advanced study in this_subject , can contribute greatly by words and example to the advance of sacred_music . Help and promote such associations , venerable_brethren , so that_they_may lead an active life , may employ the best and the most effective teachers , and so that , throughout_the entire diocese , they_may diligently promote the knowledge , love and use of sacred_music and religious harmonies , with due observance of the Church s laws and due obedience to Ourselves . Moved by paternal solicitude , We have dealt_with this_matter -atti_degli_apostoli- some length . We are entirely confident that you_,_venerable_brethren , will diligently apply all of your pastoral solicitude to this sacred subject which contributes so much to the more worthy and magnificent conduct of divine_worship . It -isaia- Our hope_that whoever in the Church supervises and directs the work of sacred_music under your leadership may be influenced by Our encyclical_letter to carry on this glorious apostolate with new ardor and new effort , generously , enthusiastically and strenuously . Hence , We hope_that this_most noble art , which_has_been so greatly esteemed throughout_the Church s history and which today has_been brought to real heights of holiness and beauty , will be developed and continually perfected and that on its_own account it will happily work to bring_the children of the Church to give due praise , expressed in worthy melodies and sweet harmonies , to the Triune God with stronger faith , more flourishing hope and more ardent charity . May it produce even outside the walls of churches in Christian families and gatherings of Christians what St . Cyprian beautifully spoke of to Donatus , '' Let the sober banquet resound with Psalms . And if your memory by good and your voice pleasant , approach this_work according to custom . You give more nourishment to those dearest to you if we hear spiritual things and if religious sweetness delights the ears . In the meantime , buoyed up by the hope of richer and more joyous fruits which We are confident will come from this_exhortation of Ours , as a testimony of Our good_will and as an omen of heavenly_gifts to each_one of you_,_venerable_brethren , to the flock entrusted_to_your care and to those_who observe Our wishes and work to promote sacred_music , with abundant charity , We impart the Apostolic Benediction .
