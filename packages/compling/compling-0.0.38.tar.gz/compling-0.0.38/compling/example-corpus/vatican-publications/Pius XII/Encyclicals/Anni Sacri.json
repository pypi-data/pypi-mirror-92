To Rome , whence the light of the Gospel teaching radiates since_the origins of the Church , multitudes of the faithful have streamed from all parts_of_the_world . They have come to the See of Peter not_only to redeem their_own faults , but_also to expiate the sins of the world and implore the return of society to God , from Whom alone_can come true peace of heart , civil concord and the well_being of nations . And We know that_these first groups of pilgrims form the vanguard of those_who will come more frequently and in greater numbers during the favorable season . Therefore , the hope -isaia- warranted that_from this still_more salutary and abundant fruits will be harvested . Nevertheless , if these sights have_given Us gentle comfort , reasons are_not lacking for the anxiety and anguish which grieve Our paternal heart . And in the first_place , although war has almost everywhere ceased , nevertheless , the longed for peace has not come a stable and solid peace which might happily solve the many and ever_increasing reasons for discord . Many nations are_still opposed to each_other ; and as confidence lessens an armaments race begins , leaving the hearts of all overcome by fear and trepidation . That which seems to Us not_only the greatest evil but the root of all evil -isaia- this : often the lie -isaia- substituted for the truth , and -isaia- then used as an instrument of dispute . On the part of not_a_few religion_-isaia- passed by as a thing of no importance , and elsewhere absolutely prohibited in family and social_life as a remnant of ancient superstitions ; public_and_private atheism -isaia- exalted in such_a_way_that God and His law are_being abolished , and morals no longer have any foundation . The Press also too_often vulgarly reviles religious feeling , while it does not_hesitate to spread the most shameful obscenities , agitating and with incalculable harm leading into vice tender childhood and betrayed youth . By means of false promises a people -isaia- deceived and provoked to hatred , rivalry and rebellion , especially_when the hereditary faith , the only relief in this earthly exile , -isaia- successfully torn from its heart . Disturbances , riots and revolts are organized and fomented in continuing series , which prepare for the ruin of the economy and cause irreparable harm to the common_good . We must above all deplore with overwhelming sadness that in not_a_few nations the rights of God , Church and human_nature itself are outraged and trampled upon . Sacred ministers , even_those invested with high dignities , are either driven from their_proper Sees , exiled and imprisoned , or impeded in a manner preventing them_from exercising their_ministry . In the field of education , whether of lower or of university level , as well as in publications and the Press , permission to explain and defend the doctrine of the Church either -isaia- not given or -isaia- so restricted and subjected to such surveillance by official censorship that the arbitrary proposition that_truth , liberty and religion must submissively serve only the civil authority seems to be the established principle . Since these innumerable evils spring , as We have_said , from one source only , the repudiation of God and contempt for His law , it -isaia- necessary , Venerable Brethren , to offer to God fervent prayers and recall all to those principles whence alone_can come enlightenment for minds , peace and concord for souls and well ordered justice between_the various social classes . As you_know , once religion_-isaia- taken away there cannot be a well ordered , well regulated society . In this_point lies the urgency to spur on priests under your guidance in order_that , especially during the Holy Year , they spare no efforts so that souls entrusted to them , with_their false prejudices and erroneous convictions cast aside , and hatreds and discords settled , may nourish themselves on the teachings of the Gospel and thus participate in Christian life so as to hasten the desired renewal of morals . And since_the priest can reach neither everybody nor everything , and as his work_-isaia- not_always able to meet adequately all needs , those_who serve in the Catholic Action ranks must offer the aid of their_own experience and activity . No one_must be idle and lazy in the face of so many evils and dangers while those in the other camp strive to destroy the very basis of Catholic religion and Christian worship . Let it never come to pass that '' the children of this_world are wiser than the children of light '' Luke xvi . ; let it never be that the latter are less active than the former . But human efforts are ineffective unless strengthened by Divine Grace . We exhort you , therefore , Venerable Brethren , to begin a veritable crusade of prayer among your faithful to implore from the Father of Mercies and the God of Consolation Cor . suitable remedies for the present evils . We intensely desire_that , united with Us , they offer public prayers on March th Passion Sunday , when_the sacred rites of the Church begin to commemorate the bitter sufferings by means of which_the Divine Redeemer liberated us from slavery to the demon and led us back to the freedom of the sons of God . It -isaia- Our intention on that day to descend into the Basilica of St . Peter to unite Our prayers not_only with_those present but as We hope with_those of the whole Catholic world . Let those_who , because of illness or old age or other reasons , cannot come to church , offer to God with humble and trusting heart their sufferings and their fears so that the prayer of all , the yearning of all and the wish of all may be one . Let all , united with Us in prayer , implore from Divine mercy that a new order , based on truth , justice and charity , may arise from the longed for restoration of morals . May the Heavenly Light illuminate the minds of those_who_have in their hands the destinies of peoples ; may_they realize_that just as peace_-isaia- the work of wisdom and justice , so war -isaia- the fruit of blindness and hatred ; let_them consider that_one day they_must render account not_only to history but to God s eternal judgment . Those who profusely sow the seed of hatred , of discord and of rivalry ; those_who secretly or openly arouse the masses and provoke rebellions ; those_who deceive with empty promises the easily agitated masses , even they_must understand_that the justice demanded by Christian principles , which_gives birth to equilibrium and fraternal concord , -isaia- achieved not through force and violence , but_with the application of the law . Guided by the supreme light gained by collective prayer , let all be persuaded that_only the Divine Redeemer can compose the many and formidable conflicts ; only Jesus Christ , We say , Who -isaia- the Way , the Truth and the Life John xvi . , Who bestows celestial clarity to clouded minds and Divine strength to doubtful and indolent wills Imitation of Christ , III , , ; He alone_can set on the road to eternal happiness the souls of men joined by the bond of brotherhood . With faith , love and hope , therefore , We address to Him Our prayers . May He then , especially during_this Holy Year , benignly look down upon humanity , oppressed by so many misfortunes , assailed by so many fears and by waves of so many discords . And as one_day , by His divine sign , He calmed the tempest on the Lake of Galilee , so today may He quieten human storms . Let the lies of the wicked be exposed by His light , let_the surly arrogance of the proud be humbled , let_the rich be led to justice , generosity and charity , let_the poor and wretched take as their model the family of Nazareth , which also earned its bread through daily labor ; finally , let those_who hold the Government of State be persuaded that_there_-isaia- no more solid social foundation than Christian teaching and the safeguarding of religious liberty . We desire , Venerable Brethren , that_you make these_things known to the faithful entrusted_to_your care and that_you exhort them to pray fervently with Us to the Lord . Confident that all will respond to our exhortations with loving willingness , with fullness of heart We impart to each_one of you and all your faithful Our Apostolic Benediction , pledge of Our benevolence and token of heavenly favor .
