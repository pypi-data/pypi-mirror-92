In all truth We can tell you , Venerable Brethren , that neither joyous nor sad events diminish the sorrow which_-isaia- kept alive in Our soul by the thought that , in the land in which_our Lord Jesus Christ shed His blood to bring redemption and salvation to all mankind , the blood of man continues to flow ; and that beneath the skies which echoed on that fateful night with the Gospel tidings of peace , men continue to fight and to increase the distress of the unfortunate and the fear of the terrorized , while thousands of refugees , homeless and driven , wander from their fatherland in search of shelter and food . To make Our sorrow more grievous , there -isaia-_not_only the news which continually reaches Us of the destruction and damage of sacred buildings and charitable places built around_the Holy Places , but there_-isaia-_also the fear that_this inspires in Us for the fate of the Holy Places themselves scattered throughout Palestine , and more especially within_the Holy City . We must assure you , Venerable Brethren , that confronted with the spectacle of many evils and the forecast of worse to come , We have_not withdrawn into Our sorrow , but have_done all in Our power to provide a remedy . Even before the armed conflict began , speaking to a delegation of Arab dignitaries who came to pay homage to Us , We manifested our lifelong solicitude for peace in Palestine , and , condemning any recourse to violence , We declared that peace could only be realized in truth and justice ; that_-isaia- to say by respecting the rights of acquired traditions , especially in the religious field , as well as by the strict fulfillment of the duties and obligations of each group of inhabitants . When war was declared , without abandoning the attitude of impartiality which_was imposed by Our apostolic duty , which places Us above the conflicts which agitate human_society , We did not_fail to do Our utmost , in the measure which depended upon Us , and according to the possibilities offered to Us , for the triumph of justice_and_peace in Palestine and for the respect and protection of the Holy Places . At the same_time , although numerous and urgent appeals are received daily by the Holy See , We have sought as much as possible to come to the aid of the unhappy victims of the war , sending the means -atti_degli_apostoli- Our disposal to Our representatives in Palestine , the Lebanon , and Egypt for this_purpose , and encouraging the formation among Catholics in various countries of undertakings organized for the same purpose . Convinced , however , of the insufficiency of human means_for the adequate solution of a question the complexity of which no one_can fail to see , We have , above all , had constant recourse to prayer , and in Our recent Encyclical Letter , Auspicia Quaedam , We invited you , Venerable Brethren , to pray , and to have_the faithful entrusted_to_your pastoral_care pray , in order_that , under the auspices of the Blessed Virgin , matters may be settled in justice_and_peace , and concord may be happily restored in Palestine . As We said on June nd to members of the Sacred College of Cardinals , informing them of Our anxieties for Palestine , We do not believe_that the Christian world could contemplate indifferently , or in sterile indignation , the spectacle of the sacred land which everyone approached with the deepest respect to kiss with most ardent love trampled over again by troops and stricken by aerial bombardments . We do not believe_that it could permit the devastation of the Holy Places , the destruction of the great sepulcher of Christ . We are full of faith_that the fervent prayers raised to Almighty and Merciful God by the Christians throughout_the_world who , together_with_the aspirations of so many noble hearts , are ardently inspired by truth and good , will render less arduous to the men_who hold the destinies of peoples the task of making justice_and_peace in Palestine a beneficial reality and of creating , with the efficient co operation of all those interested , an order_that may guarantee security of existence and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , the moral and physical conditions of life conducive to spiritual and material well_being , to each of the parties -atti_degli_apostoli- present in conflict . We are full of faith_that these prayers and these hopes , an indication of the value that the Holy Places have for so great a part of the human_family , will strengthen the conviction in the high quarters in which_the problems of peace are discussed that it would be opportune to give Jerusalem and its outskirts , where are_found so many and such precious memories of the life and death of the Savior , an international character which , in the present circumstances , seems to offer a better guarantee for the protection of the sanctuaries . It would also be necessary to assure , with international guarantees , both free access to Holy Places scattered throughout Palestine , and the freedom of worship and the respect of customs and religious traditions . And God grant that the day may soon dawn when Christians may resume their pilgrimages to the Holy Places , there to see more_clearly revealed , as they contemplate the evidence of the love of Jesus Christ , Who gave His life_for His brethren , how men and nations may live harmoniously together , -atti_degli_apostoli- peace with_their world and themselves . With reliance , then , on this hope , as a pledge of heavenly favors and in token of our affection , gladly in the Lord do we impart to you , Venerable Brethren , and to your flocks , as to all who will_take this appeal of Ours to heart , Our Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Castel Gandolfo , near Rome , on the th day of October , in the year , the tenth of Our Pontificate", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli", "author_dob": "02/03/1876", "trait": "Domenicano", "author_start": "02/03/1939", "author_end": "09/10/1958", "pontificate_years": 19}
