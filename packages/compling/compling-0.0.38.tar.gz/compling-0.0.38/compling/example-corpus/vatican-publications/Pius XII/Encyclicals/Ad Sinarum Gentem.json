About three years_ago We issued the apostolic_letter Cupimus Imprimis : ff . to Our dear Chinese people , and in a special manner to you , Venerable Catholic Brothers and beloved_sons . We issued it not_only to express to you Our sympathy in your afflictions , but_also to exhort you paternally to fulfill all the duties of the Christian religion with_that resolute fidelity that sometimes demands heroic strength . At the present moment , We once_more send up Our prayers , together_with yours , to Almighty God , Father of mercy , that '' as the sun shines_forth again after_the tempest and the storm , so , too , after so much distress , disturbances and suffering , there_will , with God s help , shine_forth upon your Church peace , tranquillity and freedom '' Ibid . In recent_years , however , the conditions of the Catholic Church in your midst have_not improved in the least . The accusations and calumnies against the Apostolic See and those_who keep themselves faithful to it have increased . The Apostolic Nuncio , who represented Our person among_you has_been expelled . The snares to deceive those less instructed in the truth have_been intensified . However as we wrote to you '' you_are opposing with a firm will all forms of insidious attack , whether subtle , hidden , or masked under a false appearance of truth '' Ibid . We know_that these_words of Our previous Apostolic Letter were_not able to reach you . So We willingly repeat them_for you by means of this Encyclical . We know too , to Our great mental comfort , that_you have persevered in your firm and holy resolve , and that no force has succeeded in separating you from the unity of the Church . For this We heartily congratulate you and give_you deserved praise . But as We must be solicitous for the eternal_salvation of each_person , We cannot hide the sadness and affliction of Our soul in learning that , although the great majority of Catholics have remained steadfast in the Faith , still there_are_some in your midst who , either deceived in their good faith , or overcome by fear , or misled by new and false doctrines , have adhered , even recently , to dangerous movements being promoted by the enemies of all religion , especially of the religion divinely revealed by Jesus Christ . The consciousness of Our duty demands_that We once_more direct Our words to you through_this Encyclical Letter , with the hope_that it can become known to you . May it be of some comfort and encouragement for those_who persevere staunchly and bravely in truth and virtue . To the others may it bring light and Our paternal admonitions . First of all , today as in the past , the persecutors of the Christians falsely accuse them of not loving their_country and of not being good citizens . We wish once_more to proclaim what cannot_fail to be recognized by anyone guided by right_reason that the Chinese Catholics are second to no one in their ardent love and ready loyalty to their most noble fatherland Ibid . The Chinese people We want to repeat what We wrote in its praise in the Apostolic Letter cited above '' from the most remote times has_been eminent among the other peoples of Asia for its achievements , its literature and the splendor of its civilization , and once it had_been illuminated by the light of the Gospel that greatly excels the wisdom of this_world , drew from it still finer qualities of soul , namely the Christian virtues which perfect and strengthen the natural virtues '' Ibid . We see_that you are_also worthy of praise for this_reason . In the daily and prolonged trials in which_you find yourselves , you follow only the just way when_you give , as becomes Christians , respectful homage to your public_authorities in the field of their competency . Moved by love of your_country , you_are ready to fulfill all your duties as citizens . But it -isaia-_also a great consolation for Us to know_that when_the occasion has arisen , you_have openly affirmed , and still affirm , that_you can in no way stray from the precepts of the Catholic religion and that_you can in no way deny your Creator and Redeemer , for Whose love many of you_have faced torture and prison . As We have_already written to you in the previous Letter , this Apostolic See , especially in these recent_times , has exercised the greatest solicitude that as many priests and Bishops of your_own noble race as possible be correctly instructed and trained . And so Our immediate predecessor_of_happy_memory , Pius XI , personally consecrated in the majestic Basilica of St . Peter the first six Bishops chosen from among your_people . We ourselves , having nothing dearer to Our heart than the daily advancement of your Church , have_been happy to establish the Sacred Hierarchy in China and for the first time in history have conferred the dignity of the Roman Purple on one of your citizens Ibid . We desire , then_,_that the day may soon come for_this We send up to God most ardent petitions and suppliant prayers when Bishops and priests of your_own nation and in sufficient number can govern_the Catholic Church in your immense country , and when there_will no longer be need of help from foreign missionaries in your apostolate . But truth itself and the knowledge of Our duty demand_that We propose for your careful attention the following points : First , these preachers of the gospel , who left their_own beloved countries to cultivate among_you the Master s field with_their labor and sweat , are_not moved by earthly motives . They seek only , and desire nothing_more than , to illumine your people_with the light of Christianity , to teach them Christian customs and to help_them with a supernatural charity . In the second place , even_when the increased number of Chinese clergy will no longer need the aid of foreign missionaries , the Catholic Church in your nation , as in all the others , will_not be able to be ruled with '' autonomy of government , '' as they_say today . In fact , even then , as you well know , it will be entirely necessary_for your Christian community , if it wishes to be part of the society divinely founded by our Redeemer , to be completely subject to the Supreme Pontiff , Vicar of Jesus Christ on earth , and be strictly united with_him in regard to religious faith_and_morals . With these_words and it -isaia- well to note them -isaia- embraced the whole_life and work of the Church , and also its constitution , its government , its discipline . All of these_things depend certainly on the will of Jesus Christ , Founder of the Church . By virtue of God s Will , the faithful_are divided into two classes : the clergy and the laity . By virtue of the same Will -isaia- established the twofold sacred hierarchy , namely , of orders and jurisdiction . Besides as has_also been divinely established the power of orders through_which the ecclesiastical hierarchy -isaia- composed of Bishops , priests , and ministers comes_from receiving the Sacrament of Holy Orders . But the power of jurisdiction , which_-isaia- conferred upon the Supreme Pontiff directly by divine rights , flows to the Bishops by the same right , but_only through the Successor of St . Peter , to whom not_only the simple faithful , but_even all the Bishops must be constantly subject , and to whom they_must be bound by obedience and with the bond of unity . Finally by the same Divine Will , the people or the civil authority must_not invade the rights and the constitution of the ecclesiastical hierarchy Cf . Council of Trent , Sess . XXIII ; De Ordine , Cann . ; Vatican Council , Sess . All ought to note what to you , Venerable brothers and beloved_sons , -isaia- evident_that We intensely desire_that the time will soon come when_the financial means furnished by the Chinese people will suffice for the needs of the Church in China . However , as you well know , the offerings received for_this from the other nations have_their origin in that Christian charity through_which all those_who_have been redeemed by the sacred blood of Jesus Christ are necessarily united to one_another in fraternal alliance and are spurred by Divine Love to spread everywhere , according_to_their strength , the kingdom of our Redeemer . And this not_for political or any profane ends , but_only to put into useful practice the precept of charity that Jesus Christ gave to us all , and through_which we are recognized as His true disciples Cf . Thus have_the Christians of all ages voluntarily done , as the Apostle of the Gentiles related of the faithful of Macedonia and Achaia , who willingly sent their offerings '' for the poor among the saints -atti_degli_apostoli- Jerusalem '' Rom . , and as the Apostle exhorted his_children in Christ who lived in Corinth and Galatia to do the same thing Cf . Lastly , there_are_some among_you who_would wish that_your Church would be completely independent , not_only , as We have_said , in regard to its government and finances , but_also in regard to the teaching of Christian doctrine and sacred preaching , in which_they try to claim '' autonomy . We do not -atti_degli_apostoli- all deny that the manner of preaching and teaching ought to differ according to place and therefore ought to conform , when possible , to the nature and particular character of the Chinese people , as also to its ancient traditional customs . If this_-isaia- properly done , certainly greater fruits will be gathered among_you . But and it -isaia- absurd merely to think of it by what right can men arbitrarily and diversely in different nations , interpret the gospel of Jesus Christ ? . Bishops , who_are the successors of the Apostles , and priests , who according_to_their proper office cooperate with the Bishops , have_been charged with announcing and teaching that gospel which Jesus and His Apostles first announced and taught , and which_this Holy See and all the Bishops united to it have preserved and transmitted pure and inviolate through the centuries . The holy pastors , therefore , are_not the inventors and the composers of this gospel , but_only its authorized custodians and its divinely constituted heralds . Wherefore We Ourselves , and the Bishops together_with Us , can and ought to repeat the words of Jesus Christ : '' My teaching_-isaia- not my own , but his who sent me '' John . And to all the Bishops , in every_age , can be directed the exhortation of St . Paul : '' O Timothy , guard the trust and keep free_from profane novelties in speech and the contradictions of so called knowledge '' I Tim . And so also these_words of the same Apostle : '' Guard the good trust through the Holy Spirit , who dwells in us '' Tim . We are_not teachers of a doctrine invented by the human mind . But our conscience obliges us to embrace and follow what Jesus Christ Himself taught , and what He solemnly commanded His Apostles and their successors to teach Cf . A Bishop , or a priest of the true Church of Christ , ought time and again to meditate on what_the Apostle Paul said of his preaching of the Gospel : '' For I give_you to understand , brethren_,_that the gospel which_was preached by me -isaia- not of man . For I did_not receive it from man , nor was I taught it ; but I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ '' Gal . Being most certain_that this_doctrine whose integrity We must defend with the help of the Holy Ghost has_been divinely revealed , We repeat these_words of the Apostle of the Gentiles : '' But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel to you other_than that which_we_have preached to you , let_him be anathema '' Gal . You can easily see , Venerable Brothers and beloved_sons , why he cannot be considered a Catholic or bear the name of Catholic who professes or teaches differently from what We have up to this_point briefly explained . This includes those persons_who have adhered to the dangerous principles underlying the movement of the '' Three Autonomies , '' or to other similar principles . The promoters of such movements with the greatest cunning seek to deceive the simple or the timid , or to draw them away from the right path . For this_purpose they falsely affirm that the only true patriots are_those_who adhere to the church thought up by them , that_-isaia- , to that_which has the '' Three Autonomies . '' But in reality they seek , in a word , to establish finally among_you a '' national '' church_,_which no longer could be Catholic because it world be the negation of that universality or rather '' catholicity '' by which_the society truly founded by Jesus Christ -isaia- above all nations and embraces them one and all . We want to repeat here_the words that We have written on the same argument in the letter already cited : '' The Church does_not single out a particular people , an individual nation , but loves all men , whatever be their nation or race , with_that supernatural charity of Christ , which_should necessarily unite all as brothers , one to the other . '' Hence it cannot be affirmed that_she serves the interests of any particular power . Nor likewise can she be expected to countenance that particular_churches be set up in each nation , thus destroying that_unity established by the Divine Founder , and unhappily separating them_from this Apostolic See where Peter , the Vicar of Jesus Christ , continues to live in his_successors until the end of time . '' Whatever Christian community were to do this , would lose its vitality as the branch cut from the vine Cf . and could_not bring forth salutary fruit '' , : p . We earnestly exhort '' in the heart of Christ '' Phil . those faithful of whom We have mournfully written above to come back to the path of repentance and salvation . Let them remember_that , when_it_-isaia- necessary , one_must render to Caesar what_-isaia- Caesar s , and with_greater reason , one_must render to God what_-isaia- God s Cf . When men demand things contrary to the Divine Will , then it -isaia- necessary to put into_practice the maxim of St . Peter : '' We must obey God rather_than men '' Acts . Let them also remember that_it_-isaia- impossible to serve two masters , if these order things opposed to one_another Cf . Also -atti_degli_apostoli- times it -isaia- impossible to please both Jesus Christ and men Cf . But if it sometimes happens_that he who wishes to remain faithful to the Divine Redeemer even unto death must suffer great harm , let_him bear it with a strong and serene soul . On the other_hand , We wish to congratulate repeatedly those_who , suffering severe difficulties , have_been outstanding in their loyalty to God and to the Catholic Church , and so have_been '' counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus '' Acts . With a paternal heart We encourage them to continue brave and intrepid along the road they have_taken , keeping in mind the words of Jesus Christ : '' And do not be afraid of those_who kill the body but cannot kill the soul . But rather be afraid of him_who_-isaia- able to destroy both soul and body in hell . But as for you , the very hairs of your head are all numbered . Therefore do not be afraid . Therefore everyone who acknowledges me before men , I will_also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven . But whoever disowns me before men , I in turn will disown him before my Father in heaven '' Matt . Certainly , O Venerable Brothers and beloved_sons , the struggle imposed on you by divine law_-isaia- not a light one . But Christ the Lord , Who has declared blessed those who_suffer persecution for_justice sake , has commanded them to be glad and rejoice , for their reward in heaven will be very great Cf . He Himself will benignly assist you from heaven with His powerful aid , so that_you can fight the good fight and keep the faith Cf . Then too , the Mother of God , the Virgin Mary , who -isaia-_also the most loving mother of all , will assist all of you with_her most efficacious protection . May she , the Queen of China , defend and help you in a particular_way in this Marian Year , so that_you_may persevere with constancy in your resolutions . May you be aided by the Holy Martyrs of China , who serenely faced death for love of their fatherland , and above all for their loyalty to the Divine Redeemer and His Church . Meanwhile may the Apostolic Benediction be for you an omen of heavenly graces , which in testimony of Our most special benevolence , We impart with much affection in the Lord both to you , Venerable Brothers and beloved_sons , and to the whole and dearest Chinese nation .
