At the tomb of the Prince of the Apostles , in the majestic Vatican Basilica , Our immediate Predecessor of deathless memory , Pius XI , duly consecrated and raised to the fullness of the priesthood , as you well know , '' the flowers and . latest buds of the Chinese episcopate . On that solemn occasion he added these_words : '' You have come , Venerable Brethren , to visit Peter , and you have_received from him the shepherd s staff , with_which to undertake your apostolic journeys and to gather together your sheep . It -isaia- Peter who with_great love has embraced you who_are in great part Our hope_for the spread of the truth of the Gospel among your_people . The memory of that allocution comes to Our mind today , Venerable Brethren and dear children , as the Catholic Church in your fatherland -isaia- experiencing great suffering and loss . But the hope of our great Predecessor was_not in vain , nor did it prove without effect , for new bands of shepherds and heralds of the Gospel have_been joined to the first group of bishops whom Peter , living in his Successor , sent to feed those chosen flocks of the Lord . New works and religious undertakings prospered among_you despite many obstacles . We too shared that hope when later We had the pleasure of establishing the hierarchy in China and saw yet wider paths opening up for the spread of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ . But , alas , after a few years the sky was overcast by storm clouds . On your Christian communities , many of which_had_been flourishing from times long past , there fell sad and sorrowful times . Missionaries , among whom were many archbishops and bishops noted for their apostolic zeal , and Our own Internuncio were driven from China , while bishops_,_priests , and religious men_and_women , together_with many of the faithful , were cast into prison or incurred every_kind of restraint and suffering . On that occasion We raised Our voice in sorrow , and , in Our Encyclical of January , , Cupimus imprimis , rebuked the unjust attack . In that letter , for the sake of truth and conscious of Our duty , We declared that the Catholic Church -isaia- a stranger to no people on earth , much less hostile to any . With a mother s anxiety , she embraces all peoples in impartial charity . She seeks no earthly advantage but employs what powers she possesses to attract the souls of all men to seek what_-isaia- eternal . We also stated_that missionaries promote the interest of no particular nation ; they come from every quarter of the earth and are_united by a single love , God , and thus they seek and hope_for nothing else save the spread of God s kingdom . Thus , it -isaia- clear_that their work_-isaia- neither without purpose nor harmful , but beneficent and necessary since it aids Chinese priests in their Christian apostolate . And some two years later , October , , another Encyclical Letter was addressed to you , beginning Ad Sinarum gentem , in which We refuted accusations made against Catholics in China . We openly declared that Catholics yielded to none nor could they do so in their true loyalty and love of their native country . Seeing also that_there was being spread among_you the doctrine of the so called '' three autonomies , '' We warned by virtue of that universal teaching_authority which We exercise by divine command that_this same doctrine as understood by its authors , whether in theory or in its consequences , cannot receive the approval of a Catholic , since it turns minds away from the essential unity of the Church . In these_days , however , We have to draw attention to the fact_that the Church in your lands in recent_years has_been brought to still worse straits . In the midst of so many great sorrows it brings Us great comfort to note that in the daily attacks which_you have met neither unflinching faith nor the most ardent love of the Divine Redeemer and of His Church has_been wanting . You have borne witness to this faith and love in innumerable ways , of which only a small part -isaia- known to men , but_for all of which_you will someday receive an eternal reward from God . Nevertheless We regard it as Our duty to declare openly , with a heart filled to its depths with sorrow and anxiety , that affairs in China are , by deceit and cunning endeavor , changing so much for the worse that the false doctrine already condemned by Us seems to be approaching its final stages and to be causing its most serious damage . For by particularly subtle activity an association has_been created among_you to which_has_been attached the title of '' patriotic , '' and Catholics are_being forced by every_means to take_part in it . This association as has often been proclaimed was formed ostensibly to join the clergy and the faithful in love of their religion and their_country , with_these objectives in view : that they_might foster patriotic sentiments ; that they_might advance the cause of international peace ; that they_might accept that species of socialism which_has_been introduced among_you and , having accepted it , support and spread it ; that , finally , they_might actively cooperate with civil authorities in defending what_they describe as political and religious_freedom . And yet despite these sweeping generalizations about defense of peace and the fatherland , which_can certainly deceive the unsuspecting it -isaia- perfectly clear_that this association -isaia- simply an attempt to execute certain well defined and ruinous policies . For under an appearance of patriotism , which in reality -isaia- just a fraud , this association aims primarily -atti_degli_apostoli- making Catholics gradually embrace the tenets of atheistic materialism , by which God Himself -isaia- denied and religious principles are rejected . Under the guise of defending peace the same association receives and spreads false rumors and accusations by which many of the clergy , including venerable bishops and even the Holy See itself , are claimed to admit to and promote schemes for earthly domination or to give ready and willing consent to exploitation of the people , as if they , with preconceived opinions , are acting with hostile intent against the Chinese nation . While they declare that_it_-isaia- essential that every_kind of freedom exist in religious matters and that_this makes mutual relations_between the ecclesiastical and civil powers easier , this association in reality aims -atti_degli_apostoli- setting aside and neglecting the rights of the Church and effecting its complete subjection to civil authorities . Hence all its_members are forced to approve those unjust prescriptions by which missionaries are cast into exile , and by which bishops_,_priests , religious men , nuns , and the faithful in considerable numbers are thrust into prison ; to consent to those measures by which_the jurisdiction of many legitimate pastors -isaia- persistently obstructed ; to defend wicked principles totally opposed to the unity , universality , and hierarchical constitution of the Church ; to admit those first steps by which_the clergy and faithful_are undermined in the obedience due to legitimate bishops ; and to separate Catholic communities from the Apostolic See . In order to spread these wicked principles more efficiently and to fix them in everyone s mind , this association which , as We have_said , boasts of its patriotism uses a variety of means including violence and oppression , numerous lengthy publications , and group meetings and congresses . In these meetings , the unwilling are forced to take_part by incitement , threats , and deceit . If any bold spirit strives to defend truth , his voice -isaia- easily smothered and overcome and he -isaia- branded with a mark of infamy as an enemy of his native land and of the new society . There should_also be noted those courses of instruction by which pupils are forced to imbibe and embrace this false doctrine . Priests , religious men_and_women , ecclesiastical students , and faithful of all ages are forced to attend these courses . An almost endless series of lectures and discussions , lasting for weeks and months , so weaken and benumb the strength of mind and will that by a kind of psychic coercion an assent -isaia- extracted which contains almost no human element , an assent which_-isaia-_not freely asked for as should be the case . In addition to these there_are the methods by which minds are upset by every device , in private and in public , by traps , deceits , grave fear , by so called forced confessions , by custody in a place_where citizens are forcibly '' reeducated , '' and those '' Peoples Courts '' to which even venerable bishops are ignominiously dragged for trial . Against methods of acting such as these , which violate the principal rights of the human_person and trample on the sacred liberty of the sons of God , all Christians from every part_of_the_world , indeed all men_of_good sense cannot refrain from raising their voices with Us in real horror and from uttering a protest deploring the deranged conscience of their fellow men . And since these crimes are_being committed under the guise of patriotism , We consider it Our duty to remind everyone once_again of the Church s teaching on this_subject . For the Church exhorts and encourages Catholics to love their_country with sincere and strong love , to give due obedience in accord with natural and positive divine_law to those_who hold public office , to give_them active and ready assistance for the promotion of those undertakings by which their native land can in peace and order daily achieve greater prosperity and further true development . The Church has_always impressed on the minds of her_children that declaration of the Divine Redeemer : '' Render therefore to Caesar the things_that_are Caesar s and to God the things_that_are God s . '' We call it a declaration because these_words make certain and incontestable the principle that Christianity never opposes or obstructs what_-isaia- truly useful or advantageous to a country . However , if Christians are_bound in conscience to render to Caesar that_-isaia- , to human authority what belongs to Caesar , then Caesar likewise , or those_who control the state , cannot exact obedience when they_would be usurping God s rights or forcing Christians either to act -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with_their religious duties or to sever themselves from the unity of the Church and its lawful hierarchy . Under such circumstances , every Christian should cast aside all doubt and calmly and firmly repeat the words with_which Peter and the other Apostles answered the first persecutors of the Church : '' We must obey God rather_than men . With emphatic insistence , those_who promote the interests of this association which claims a monopoly on patriotism , speak over and over again of peace and admonish Catholics earnestly to exert all their_efforts to establish it . On the surface these_words are excellent and righteous , for who deserves greater praise than the man_who prepares the way to introduce and establish peace ? . But peace as you well know , Venerable Brethren and beloved_sons does_not consist of words alone and does_not rely on changing formulas which_are suitable for the moment but contradict one s real plans and practices , which do not conform with the meaning and way of true peace but_with hatred , discord , and deceit . Peace worthy of the name must be founded on the principles of charity and justice which He taught who_-isaia- the '' Prince of Peace , '' and who adopted this title as a kind of royal standard for Himself . True peace_-isaia- that_which the Church desires to be established : one that_-isaia- stable , just , fair , and founded on right order ; one_which binds all together citizens , families , and peoples by the firm ties of the rights of the Supreme Lawgiver , and by the bonds of mutual fraternal love and cooperation . As she looks forward to and hopes for_this peaceful dwelling together of nations , the Church expects each nation to preserve that degree of dignity which becomes it . For the Church , which_has ever kept a friendly attitude toward_the various events in your_country , long ago spoke through Our late Predecessor of happy_memory and expressed the desire_that '' full recognition be given to the legitimate aspirations and rights of the nation , which_-isaia- more populous than any_other , whose civilization and culture go back to the earliest times , which_has , in past ages , with the development of its resources , had periods of great prosperity , and which it may be reasonably conjectured will_become even greater in the future ages , provided it pursues justice and honor . On the other_hand , as has_been made_known by radio and by the press , there_are_some even among the ranks of the clergy who_do_not shrink from casting suspicion on the Apostolic See and hint that it has evil designs toward your_country . Assuming false and unjust premises , they_are_not afraid to take a position which_would confine within a narrow scope the supreme teaching_authority of the Church , claiming that_there are certain questions such as those_which concern social_and_economic matters in which Catholics may ignore the teachings and the directives of this Apostolic See . This opinion it seems entirely unnecessary to demonstrate its existence -isaia- utterly false and full of error because , as We declared a few years_ago to a special meeting of Our Venerable Brethren in the episcopacy : . '' The power of the Church -isaia- in no sense limited to so called strictly religious matters '' ; but the whole matter of the natural_law , its institution , interpretation and application , in so far as the moral aspect -isaia- concerned , are within its power . '' By God s appointment the observance of the natural_law concerns the way by which_man must strive toward his supernatural end . The Church shows the way and -isaia- the guide and guardian of men with_respect to their supernatural end . This truth had already_been wisely explained by Our Predecessor St . Pius X in his Encyclical Letter Singulari quadam of September , , in which he made this statement : '' All actions of a Christian man so far as they_are morally either good or bad that_-isaia- , so far as they agree with or are contrary to the natural and divine_law fall under the judgment and jurisdiction of the Church . Moreover , even_when those_who arbitrarily set and defend these narrow limits profess a desire to obey the Roman Pontiff with_regard to truths to be believed , and to observe what_they call ecclesiastical directives , they proceed with_such boldness that_they refuse to obey the precise and definite prescriptions of the Holy See . They protest that_these refer to political affairs because of a hidden meaning by the author , as if these prescriptions took their origin from some secret conspiracy against their_own nation . Here We must mention a symptom of this falling away from the Church . It -isaia- a very serious matter and fills Our heart_the heart of a Father and universal Pastor of the faithful with a grief that defies description . For those_who profess themselves most interested in the welfare of their_country have for some considerable time been striving to disseminate among the people the position , devoid of all truth , that Catholics have_the power of directly electing their bishops . To excuse this_kind of election they allege a need to look after_the good souls with all possible speed and to entrust the administration of dioceses to those pastors who , because_they do not oppose the communist desires and political methods , are acceptable by the civil_power . We have heard that_many such elections have_been held contrary to all right and law and that , in addition , certain ecclesiastics have rashly dared to receive episcopal consecration , despite the public and severe warning which_this Apostolic See gave those involved . Since , therefore , such serious offenses against the discipline and unity of the Church are_being committed , We must in conscience warn all that_this_-isaia- completely -atti_degli_apostoli- variance with the teachings and principles on which rests the right order of the society divinely instituted by Jesus Christ our Lord . For it has_been clearly and expressly laid_down in the canons that it pertains to the one Apostolic See to judge whether a person_-isaia- fit for the dignity and burden of the episcopacy , and that complete freedom in the nomination of bishops -isaia- the right of the Roman Pontiff . But if , as happens -atti_degli_apostoli- times , some persons or groups are permitted to participate in the selection of an episcopal candidate , this_-isaia- lawful only if the Apostolic See has allowed it in express terms and in each particular case for clearly defined persons or groups , the conditions and circumstances being very plainly determined . Granted this exception , it follows_that bishops who_have_been neither named nor confirmed by the Apostolic See , but who , on the contrary , have_been elected and consecrated in defiance of its express orders , enjoy no powers of teaching or of jurisdiction since jurisdiction passes to bishops only through the Roman Pontiff as We admonished in the Encyclical Letter Mystici Corporis in the following words : '' . As far as his_own diocese -isaia- concerned each bishop feeds the flock entrusted to him as a true shepherd and rules it in the name of Christ . Yet in exercising this office they_are_not altogether independent but are subordinate to the lawful authority of the Roman Pontiff , although enjoying ordinary power of jurisdiction which_they receive directly from the same Supreme Pontiff . And when We later addressed to you the letter Ad Sinarum gentem , We again referred to this_teaching in these_words : '' The power of jurisdiction which_-isaia- conferred directly by divine right on the Supreme Pontiff comes to bishops by that_same right , but_only through the successor of Peter , to whom not_only the faithful but_also all bishops are_bound to be constantly subject and to adhere both by the reverence of obedience and by the bond of unity . Acts requiring the power of Holy Orders which_are performed by ecclesiastics of this_kind , though_they are valid as long as the consecration conferred on them was valid , are yet gravely illicit , that_-isaia- , criminal and sacrilegious . To such conduct the warning words of the Divine Teacher fittingly apply : '' He who enters not by the door into the sheepfold , but climbs up another way , -isaia- a thief and a robber . '' The sheep indeed know_the true shepherd s voice . '' But a stranger they_will not follow , but will flee from him , because_they do not know_the voice of strangers . We are aware that_those_who thus belittle obedience in order to justify themselves_with regard to those functions which_they_have unrighteously assumed , defend their position by recalling a usage which prevailed in ages past . Yet everyone sees that all ecclesiastical discipline -isaia- overthrown if it -isaia- in any_way lawful for one to restore arrangements which_are no longer valid because the supreme_authority of the Church long ago decreed otherwise . In no sense do they excuse their_way of acting by appealing to another custom , and they indisputably prove that_they follow this line deliberately in order to escape from the discipline which now prevails and which_they ought to be obeying . We mean_that discipline which_has_been established not_only_for China and the regions recently enlightened by the light of the Gospel , but_for the whole Church , a discipline which_takes its sanction from that universal and supreme power of caring for , ruling , and governing which_our Lord granted to the successors in the office of St . Peter the Apostle . Well known are the terms of Vatican Council s solemn definition : '' Relying on the open testimony of the Scriptures and abiding by the wise and clear decrees both of our_predecessors , the Roman Pontiffs , and the general Councils , We renew the definition of the Ecumenical Council of Florence , by virtue of which all the faithful must believe_that the Holy Apostolic See and the Roman Pontiff hold primacy over the whole_world , and the Roman Pontiff himself_-isaia- the Successor of the blessed Peter and continues to be the true Vicar of Christ and head of the whole Church , the father and teacher of all Christians , and to him -isaia- the blessed Peter our Lord Jesus Christ committed the full power of caring for , ruling and governing the Universal Church . We declare that the Roman Church by the Providence of God holds the primacy of ordinary power over all others , and that this_power of jurisdiction of the Roman Pontiff , which_-isaia- truly episcopal , -isaia- immediate . Toward it , the pastors and the faithful of whatever rite and dignity , both individually and collectively , are_bound by the duty of hierarchical subordination and true obedience , not_only in matters which pertain to faith_and_morals , but_also in those_which concern the discipline and government of the Church spread throughout_the whole_world , in such_a_way_that once the unity of communion and the profession of the same Faith has_been preserved with the Roman Pontiff , there_-isaia-_one flock of the Church of Christ under one supreme shepherd . This -isaia- the teaching of the Catholic truth from which no one_can depart without loss of faith and salvation . From what We have_said , it follows_that no authority whatsoever , save that_which_-isaia- proper to the Supreme Pastor , can render void the canonical appointment granted to any bishop ; that no person or group , whether of priests or of laymen , can claim the right of nominating bishops ; that_no_one can lawfully confer episcopal consecration unless he has_received the mandate of the Apostolic See . Consequently , if consecration of this_kind -isaia- being done contrary to all right and law , and by this crime the unity of the Church -isaia- being seriously attacked , an excommunication reserved specialissimo modo to the Apostolic See has_been established which_-isaia- automatically incurred by the consecrator and by anyone_who has_received consecration irresponsibly conferred . What then -isaia- to be the opinion concerning the excuse added by members of the association promoting false patriotism , that_they had to act as they alleged because of the need to tend to the souls in those dioceses which_were then without a bishop ? . It -isaia- obvious that no thought -isaia- being taken of the spiritual good of the faithful if the Church s laws are_being violated , and further , there_-isaia- no question of vacant sees , as they wish to argue in defense , but of episcopal sees whose legitimate rulers have_been driven out or now languish in prison or are_being obstructed in various_ways from the free exercise of their_power of jurisdiction . It must likewise be added that_those clerics have_been cast into prison , exiled , or removed by other means , whom_the lawful ecclesiastical superiors had designated in accordance_with canon_law and the special powers received_from_the Apostolic See to act in their place in the government of the dioceses . It -isaia- surely a matter for grief that while holy bishops noted for their zeal for souls are enduring so many trials , advantage -isaia- taken of their difficulties to establish false shepherds in their place so that the hierarchical order of the Church -isaia- overthrown and the authority of the Roman Pontiff -isaia- treacherously resisted . And some have even become so arrogant that_they blame the Apostolic See for these terrible and tragic events which_have certainly been deliberate accomplishments of the Church s persecutors even_though everyone knows that the Church has_been unable , in the past and -atti_degli_apostoli- present , when such information has_been needed , to obtain requisite data about qualified candidates_for the episcopacy simply because_she was prevented from communicating freely and safely with the dioceses of China . Venerable brethren and dear children , thus far We have told you of the anxiety with which_we_are moved by the errors which certain men_are trying to sow among_you , and by the dissensions which are_being aroused . Our intention -isaia- that , enlightened and strengthened by the encouragement of your common father , you_may remain steadfast and without blemish in that_faith by which We are_united and by which alone We shall obtain salvation . But now , following the ardent dictates of Our heart , We must tell you of the close and particular feelings of intimacy which draw Us near to you . To Our mind come those torments which rend asunder your bodies or your minds , particularly those_which the most valiant witnesses of Christ are enduring , among whose number are several of Our Venerable Brethren in the episcopate . Daily -atti_degli_apostoli- the altar We offer to the Divine Redeemer the trials of all of them , together_with_the prayers and sufferings of the whole Church . Be constant then and put your trust in Him according to the words : '' Cast all your anxiety upon Him , because He cares for you . He sees clearly your anguish and your torments . He particularly finds acceptable the grief of soul and the tears which many of you , bishops and priests , religious and laymen , pour forth in secret when_they behold the efforts of those_who_are striving to subvert the Christians among_you . These tears , these bodily pains and tortures , the blood of the martyrs of past and present all will_bring it about_that , through the powerful intervention of Mary , the Virgin Mother of God , Queen of China , the Church in your native land will -atti_degli_apostoli- long last regain its strength and in a calmer age , happier days will shine upon it . Relying on this hope , to you and to the flocks committed to your_care We most lovingly grant in the Lord , as a token of divine gifts and a sign of Our special good_will , Our Apostolic Benediction .
