That admirable prodigy of fraternal concord which_the numberless multitudes of the faithful , from almost every nation , flocking to Rome as devout pilgrims during the course of the Holy Year have provided seems to us to contain as it were a warning voice , a solemn testimony to everybody that the peoples of the world do not wish for war nor discord nor hatred , but ardently desire peace , unity of minds and that Christian love_which alone_can be the source of a better and more happy era for all . It -isaia-_our ardent wish_that all should -atti_degli_apostoli- last hear that warning , as with anxious mind We behold peoples engaged in a fearful preparation_for war while in certain places a horrible fury of slaughter -isaia-_already reaping its harvest of courageous , youthful lives . Is it not abundantly clear_that bloody conflicts bring in their wake untold ruins , slaughter and misery of every_kind ? So terrible are the mechanical equipment and instruments of modern warfare invented by the genius of man genius which indeed was created for other purposes that_they must inspire any thinking person with profound horror , especially as they oftentimes strike not merely armies but_also civilians and even innocent children , women , the aged and infirm , and likewise sacred buildings and most outstanding artistic achievements . Who -isaia- there who_-isaia- not stricken with horror -atti_degli_apostoli- the thought of possible addition of other cemeteries to the innumerable graveyards of the recent war ; likewise , that to the still crumbling walls of so many cities and towns still further ruins may be added ? Who -isaia- there , in fine , who_does_not tremble -atti_degli_apostoli- the prospect of economic difficulties which so greatly affect almost all peoples , and in particular those of the poorer classes , being aggravated still_more by the further loss of wealth which_-isaia- a necessary concomitant of war . We who raise our_mind above the flood of human desires , We who cherish fatherly affection for the people of all nations and races and desire to preserve intact the peace of all and to daily advance their prosperity , We , Venerable Brethren , whenever We see the brightness of the heavens overcast with lowering clouds and new dangers of wars threaten mankind , We cannot help raising our voice and exhorting all to put aside animosities , to compose differences and to introduce that true peace which , as it behooves , will publicly and sincerely recognize and safeguard the rights of religion and peoples and of individual citizens . Nevertheless we well know that_human efforts are incapable of achieving such result . It -isaia- necessary first of all to renew the hearts of men , to repress covetousness and greed , to allay hatreds , to really put into_practice the norms and dealings of justice , to bring_about a better distribution of wealth , to foster mutual charity and to stir up virtue in all . There -isaia- nothing which_can conduce more_effectively and contribute more to the attainment of this_great objective than the Christian religion ; for its divine precepts teach us that_men , as brothers , form one family whose Father -isaia- God , of which Christ -isaia- the Redeemer and by His heavenly grace the nourisher , and whose lasting homeland -isaia- Heaven . If these precepts were really and duly put into_effect , then without_any doubt no wars , sedition , strife or suppression of civil or religious liberty would disturb public_and_private life , but a peaceful stability , founded on right order and justice , would possess the minds and souls of men and would open up a safe path to the attainment of a daily growing measure of prosperity . This -isaia- indeed a difficult but necessary task . And if necessary it can brook no delay , but should be put into_effect as soon as possible . If it -isaia- difficult and beyond human capacity , then we must have_recourse in prayer and supplication to the heavenly Father , as down through the centuries in times of crisis our forefathers have_done with happy and salutary results . Wherefore We strongly urge and exhort you , Venerable Brethren , to arrange for public supplications and to invite your flocks to implore peace and concord for peoples ; so that under the patronage of religion there_may be a sacred struggle , as it were , to offset that abominable strife which threatens the whole human_family with so many dangers . You are undoubtedly aware_that We shall celebrate the Eucharistic sacrifice -atti_degli_apostoli- the hour of midnight that marks the beginning of the feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary , and that_our suppliant voice by means of radio communication may be heard by all . We wish , moreover , that especially on that holy night all the faithful , united with the Vicar of Jesus Christ , should invoke from the Father of Mercies through the intercession of the most powerful patronage of the Virgin Mother of God , preserved from every stain of Original Sin , that -atti_degli_apostoli- long last , with hatreds put to rest and all differences justly and equitably settled , the light of real and genuine peace may radiate to all nations and peoples . And We further desire_that with the same spiritual ardor for_this cause prayers be repeatedly offered during the novena of supplication customarily held in preparation_for the solemn feast of the Birth of Jesus Christ , to beseech the Divine Infant that the peace proclaimed above His sacred crib by angelic choirs to men_of_good will Luke , may shine_forth throughout_the_world and become firmly established everywhere . Nor should there be omitted earnest prayers of supplication to the new born Redeemer through His Blessed Mother that the Catholic religion , which -isaia-_the_most secure foundation of human_society and civilized culture , may enjoy due liberty in all nations and that_those '' who_suffer persecution for_justice sake '' Matt . , , those_who because_of_their courageous defense of the rights of the Holy Church are confined to prison , or are driven forth and banished from their homes , and those also who , exiled from their fatherlands , wander about in wretchedness or still languish in captivity , may receive heavenly consolations and be granted -atti_degli_apostoli- length that good fortune which_they_have been awaiting with_such burning desire and ardent longing . We do not doubt , Venerable Brethren , that_with your usual pastoral_care and diligence you will communicate this , our_paternal exhortation , to your_clergy and faithful in the way you deem most suitable ; and We likewise feel certain_that all our dearly beloved_children in Christ throughout_the_world will gladly and willingly correspond to this present invitation . Meanwhile , may the apostolic_blessing which , lovingly in the Lord , We impart as a pledge of our_paternal benevolence be to each and all of you , Venerable Brethren , to all your fellow citizens , and to those in particular who pour forth suppliant prayers in accordance_with our intentions , a source of heavenly graces .
