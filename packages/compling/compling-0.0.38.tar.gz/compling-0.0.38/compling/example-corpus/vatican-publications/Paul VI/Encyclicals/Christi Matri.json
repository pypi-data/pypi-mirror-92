Venerable Brothers , Health and Apostolic Benediction . It -isaia- a solemn custom of the faithful during the month of October to weave the prayers of the Rosary into mystical garlands for the Mother of Christ . Following in the footsteps of Our predecessors , We heartily approve this , and We call_upon all the sons of the church to offer special devotions to the Most Blessed Virgin this_year . For the danger of a more_serious and extensive calamity hangs over the human_family and has increased , especially in parts of eastern Asia where a bloody and hard fought war -isaia- raging . So We feel most urgently that We must once_again do what We can to safeguard peace . We are_also disturbed by what We know to be going on in other areas , such as the growing nuclear armaments race , the senseless nationalism , the racism , the obsession for revolution , the separations imposed upon citizens , the nefarious plots , the slaughter of innocent people . All of these can furnish material for the greatest calamity . A Special Task from God . Like Our immediate predecessors , We seem to have_received a special task from God in His providence to work patiently and constantly to preserve and strengthen peace . This task , as -isaia- evident , arises from the fact_that We have_been entrusted with the governing of the whole Church , which , as a '' sign lifted up to the nations , '' does_not serve political ends but_rather must bring_the truth and grace of Jesus Christ , its divine Founder , to mankind . Indeed , from the very_beginning of Our apostolic ministry , We have omitted no effort to further the cause of peace in the world through prayers , entreaties and exhortations . As you well remember , last year We flew to North America to speak about the most desirable blessing of peace -atti_degli_apostoli- the General Assembly of the United Nations , before a very distinguished audience representing almost every nation . We warned against allowing some to be inferior to others , and against allowing some to attack others . Instead , all should devote their_efforts and zeal to the establishment of peace . Even afterwards , moved by apostolic concern , We did_not stop urging those upon whom this_great matter depends to ward off from mankind the frightful disaster that might result . A Very Grave Obligation . Now once_again We raise Our voice '' with a loud cry and with tears , '' urgently beseeching those_who rule over nations to do everything they_can to see_to_it_that the conflagration spreads no farther but_rather -isaia- completely extinguished . We do not doubt_that all men_who want what_-isaia- right and honorable whatever their race , color , religion and social class feel the same as We do . Therefore , let all those responsible bring_about the necessary conditions for the laying down of arms before the possibility of doing so -isaia- taken away by the pressure of events . Those in whose hands rests the safety of the human_race should realize_that in this_day and age they_have a very grave obligation in conscience . Mindful of their_own nation , of the world , of God and history , let_them examine their_own consciences . Let them realize_that in the future their names will be blessed if they wisely succeed in complying with this_exhortation . Negotiations Must Begin . In the name of the Lord We cry out to them to stop . Men must come together and get down to sincere negotiations . Things must be settled now , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of some loss of inconvenience , for later they may_have to be settled -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of immense harm and enormous slaughter that cannot even be imagined now . But this peace must be based on justice and freedom for mankind , and must_take into_account_the rights of individuals and communities . Otherwise it will be fluid and unstable . As We say all this with deep emotion and an anxious heart , it -isaia- only right for Us to do as Our supreme pastoral_care urges , and ask for help from heaven . Peace , which '' -isaia- such a great good that_even among earthly , mortal things , there_-isaia-_nothing more pleasant to hear , nothing_more ardently desired , and finally nothing better to be found , '' has to be sought from Him who_-isaia- the Prince of Peace . But since_the Church , in uncertain and anxious times , has_been accustomed to have_recourse to that_most ready intercessor , her Mother Mary , We have good_reason to direct Our own attention and yours , venerable_brethren , and that of all the Christian faithful , to her . Irenaeus says , she '' has become the cause of salvation for the whole_human_race . '' Mary , Queen of Peace . Nothing seems more appropriate and valuable to Us than to have_the prayers of the whole Christian family rise to the Mother of God , who_-isaia- invoked as the Queen of Peace , begging her to pour forth abundant gifts of her_maternal goodness in midst of so many great trials and hardships . We want constant and devout prayers to be offered to her whom We declared Mother of the Church , its spiritual parent , during the celebration of the Second Vatican Council , thereby winning the applause of the Fathers and of the Catholic world , and confirming a point of traditional doctrine . For the Mother of the Savior -isaia- , as St . Augustine teaches , '' surely the mother of His members , '' and St . Anselm , to mention only_one other , agrees with_him in these_words : '' What could ever be deemed more suitable than for you to be the mother of those_whose father and brother Christ deigned to become ? '' She was called '' most truly the mother of the Church '' by Our predecessor Leo XIII . Hence We have good_reason to place our trust in her in the midst of this terrible disorder . The Value of the Rosary . If evils increase , the devotion of the People of God should_also increase . And so , venerable_brothers , We want you to take the lead in urging and encouraging people to pray ardently to our most merciful mother Mary by saying the Rosary during the month of October , as We have_already indicated . This prayer_-isaia- well suited to the devotion of the People of God , most pleasing to the Mother of God and most effective in gaining heaven s blessings . The Second Vatican Council recommended use of the Rosary to all the sons of the Church , not in express words but in unmistakable fashion in this phrase : '' Let them value highly the pious practices and exercises directed to the Blessed Virgin and approved over the centuries by the magisterium . As the history of the Church makes clear , this_very fruitful way of praying -isaia-_not_only efficacious in warding off evils and preventing calamities , but -isaia-_also of great help in fostering Christian life . '' It nourishes the Catholic faith_which readily takes on new_life from a timely commentary on the sacred mysteries , and it turns minds toward_the truths that have_been taught us by God . And so during the month of October , dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary , prayers and petitions should be increased , so that_through her intercession the dawn of true peace may shine_forth to men . This means true religious peace too , for unfortunately , not everyone -isaia- allowed to profess his religion freely in this age . In particular , We want October th the day on which , as We mentioned earlier , We went last year to the United Nations for the sake of peace to be celebrated throughout_the whole Catholic world this_year as a Day of Prayer for Peace . It will be up to you_,_venerable_brethren , in the light of your_own commendable devotion and on the basis of the obvious importance of this_matter , to prescribe sacred ceremonies in which priests , religious and the faithful especially boys and girls in the flower of their innocence , and the sick and others_who are suffering can all ask the help of the Mother of God and of the Church . On that day We Ourself will go to St . Peter s Basilica , to the tomb of the Prince of the Apostles , to offer special prayers to the Virgin Mother of God , protector of Christians and mediator for peace . In this_way heaven will be moved , in a sense , by the one voice of the Church resounding from all the continents on the earth . Augustine says , '' Amid the various languages of men , the faith of the heart speaks one tongue . Look down with maternal clemency , Most Blessed Virgin , upon all your children . Consider the anxiety of bishops_who fear that_their flocks will be tormented by a terrible storm of evils . Heed the anguish of so many_people , fathers and mothers of families who_are uncertain about their future and beset by hardships and cares . Soothe the minds of those -atti_degli_apostoli- war and inspire them_with '' thoughts of peace . '' Through your intercession , may God , the avenger of injuries , turn to mercy . May He give back to nations the tranquility they seek and bring them to a lasting age of genuine prosperity . With confidence that the exalted Mother of God will graciously hear Our humble prayer , We lovingly impart the apostolic_blessing to you_,_venerable_brethren , and to the clergy_and_people committed to your_care .
