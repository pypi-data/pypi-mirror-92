If any_one of you -isaia- ill , he says , he should send for the elders of the church , and they_must anoint him_with oil in the name of the Lord and pray over him . The prayer of faith will save the sick man and the Lord will raise him up again ; and if he has committed any sins , he will be forgiven James : . '' From ancient times testimonies of the Anointing of the Sick are_found in the Church s Tradition , particularly her liturgical Tradition , both in the East and in the West . Especially worthy of note in this_regard are the Letter which Innocent I , our predecessor , addressed to Decentius , Bishop of Gubbio , and the venerable prayer used for blessing the Oil of the Sick : '' Send forth , Lord , your Holy Spirit , the Paraclete , '' which_was inserted in the Eucharistic Prayer and -isaia- still preserved in the Roman Pontifical . In the course of the centuries , in the liturgical Tradition the parts of the body of the sick person to be anointed with Holy Oil were more explicitly defined , in different_ways , and there_were added various formulas to accompany the anointings with prayer , which_are contained in the liturgical books of various Churches . During the Middle Ages , in the Roman Church there prevailed the custom of anointing the sick on the five senses , using the formula : '' Per istam Sanctam unctionem et suam Piissimam misericordiam , indulgeat tibi Dominus quidquid deliquisti , '' adapted to each sense . In addition , the doctrine concerning Sacred Anointing -isaia- expounded in the documents of the Ecumenical Councils , namely the Council of Florence and in particular the Council of Trent and the Second Vatican Council . After the Council of Florence had described the essential elements of the Anointing of the Sick , the Council of Trent declared its divine institution and explained what_-isaia- given in the Epistle of Saint James concerning the Sacred Anointing , especially with_regard to the reality and effects of the sacrament : '' This reality -isaia-_in_fact the grace of the Holy Spirit , whose anointing takes away sins , if any still remain to be taken away , and the remnants of sin ; it also relieves and strengthens the soul of the sick person , arousing in him a great confidence in the divine mercy , whereby being thus sustained he more_easily bears the trials and labors of his sickness , more_easily resists the temptations of the devil lying in wait Gen . : , and sometimes regains bodily health , if this_-isaia- expedient for the health of the soul . '' The same Council also declared that in these_words of the Apostle it -isaia- stated with sufficient clarity that '' this anointing -isaia- to be administered to the sick , especially_those who_are in such a condition as to appear to have reached the end of their_life , whence it -isaia-_also called the sacrament of the dying . '' Finally , it declared that the priest_-isaia- the proper minister of the sacrament . The Second Vatican Council adds the following : '' Extreme Unction , which_may also and more fittingly be called Anointing of the Sick , -isaia- not a sacrament for those only who are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the point of death . Hence , as soon as any_one of the faithful begins to be in danger of death from sickness or old age , the appropriate time for him to receive this_sacrament has certainly already arrived . '' The fact_that the use of this_sacrament concerns the whole Church -isaia- shown by these_words : '' By the sacred anointing of the sick and the prayer of her priests , the whole Church commends those_who_are ill to the suffering and glorified Lord , asking that_he_may lighten their suffering and save them cf . She exhorts them , moreover , to contribute to the welfare of the whole People of God by associating themselves freely with the passion and death of Christ cf . '' All these elements had to be taken into consideration in revising the rite of Sacred Anointing , in order better to adapt to present_day conditions those elements which_were subject to change . We thought fit to modify the sacramental formula in such_a_way_that , in view of the words of Saint James , the effects of the sacrament might be better expressed . Further , since olive oil , which hitherto had_been prescribed for the valid administration of the sacrament , -isaia- unobtainable or difficult to obtain in some parts_of_the_world , we decreed , -atti_degli_apostoli- the request of numerous bishops , that in the future , according to the circumstances , oil of another sort could also be used , provided it were obtained from plants , inasmuch as this more_closely resembles the matter indicated in Holy Scripture . As regards the number of anointings and the parts of the body to be anointed , it has seemed to us opportune to proceed to a simplification of the rite . Therefore , since_this revision in certain point s touches upon the sacramental rite itself , by our Apostolic authority we lay_down that the following -isaia- to be observed for the future in the Latin Rite : THE SACRAMENT OF THE ANOINTING OF THE SICK IS ADMINISTERED TO THOSE WHO ARE DANGEROUSLY ILL , BY ANOINTING THEM ON THE FOREHEAD AND HANDS WITH OLIVE OIL , OR , IF OPPORTUNE , WITH ANOTHER VEGETABLE OIL , PROPERLY BLESSED , AND SAYING ONCE ONLY THE FOLLOWING WORDS : '' PER ISTAM SANCTAM UNCTIONEM ET SUAM PIISSIMAM MISERICORDIAM ADIUVET TE DOMINUS GRATIA SPIRITUS SANCTI , UT A PECCATIS LIBERATUM TE SALVET ATQUE PROPITIUS ALLEVIET . In case of necessity however it -isaia- sufficient that a single anointing be given on the forehead or , because of the particular condition of the sick person , on another more suitable part of the body , the whole formula being pronounced . This sacrament can be repeated if the sick person , having once received_the Anointing , recovers and then again falls sick , or if , in the course of the same illness , the danger becomes more acute Having laid_down and declared these elements concerning the essential rite of the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick , we , by our Apostolic authority , also approve the Order of the Anointing of the Sick and of their pastoral_care , as it has_been revised by the Sacred Congregation for Divine Worship . At the same_time , we revoke , where necessary , the prescriptions of the Code of Canon Law or other laws hitherto in force , or we abrogate them ; other prescriptions and laws , which_are neither abrogated nor changed by the above mentioned Order , remain valid and in force . The Latin edition of the Order containing the new rite will come into force as soon as it -isaia- published . The vernacular editions , prepared by the episcopal_conferences and confirmed by the Apostolic See , will come into force on the day that_will be laid_down by the individual conferences . The old Order can be used until December , . From January , , however , the new Order only -isaia- to be used by all those_whom it concerns . We desire_that these decrees and prescriptions of ours shall , now and in the future , be fully effective in the Latin Rite , notwithstanding , as far as -isaia- necessary , the Apostolic Constitutions and Directives issued by our_predecessors and other prescriptions , even if worthy of special mention .
