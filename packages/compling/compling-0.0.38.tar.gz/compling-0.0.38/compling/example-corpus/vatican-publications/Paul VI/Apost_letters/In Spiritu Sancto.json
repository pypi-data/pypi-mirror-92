Joseph , her glorious spouse , and of the Apostles SS . Peter and Paul , must be numbered without_doubt among the greatest events of the Church . In fact it was_the largest in the number of Fathers who came to the seat of Peter from every part_of_the_world , even from those places_where the hierarchy has_been very recently established . It was_the richest because of the questions which for four sessions have_been discussed carefully and profoundly . And last of all it was_the most opportune , because , bearing in mind the necessities of the present_day , above all it sought to meet_the pastoral needs and , nourishing the flame of charity , it has made a great effort to reach not_only the Christians still separated_from communion with the Holy See , but_also the whole human_family . At last all which regards the holy ecumenical_council has , with the help of God , been accomplished and all the constitutions , decrees , declarations and votes have_been approved by the deliberation of the synod and promulgated by us . Therefore we decided to close for all intents and purposes , with our_apostolic authority , this_same ecumenical_council called by our predecessor , Pope John XXIII , which opened October , , and which_was continued by us after_his death . We decided moreover that all that_has_been established synodally -isaia- to be religiously observed by all the faithful , for the glory of God and the dignity of the Church and for the tranquillity and peace of all men . We have approved and established these_things , decreeing that the present letters are and remain stable and valid , and are to have legal effectiveness , so that_they be disseminated and obtain full and complete effect , and so that_they_may be fully convalidated by those_whom they concern or may concern now and in the future ; and so that , as it be judged and described , all efforts contrary to these_things by whomever or whatever authority , knowingly or in ignorance be invalid and worthless from now on . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , under the seal of the ring of the fisherman , Dec . , on the feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the year , the third year_of_our pontificate", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini", "author_dob": "26/09/1897", "author_start": "21/06/1963", "author_end": "06/08/1978", "pontificate_years": 15}
