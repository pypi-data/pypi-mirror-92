This project -isaia- something_that many have asked of us , and since we consider it fully in harmony_with_the tasks which_the Church must undertake in the modern_world , we intend to inform you diligently of it ; for you more_than anyone else know and share our cares . We refer to the project of linking more_closely within_the broad field of Christian solidarity among peoples and the promoting of the development of mankind through true charity all the energies and the initiatives which flourish in the Church . The aim -isaia- to enable the bishops of the whole_world , and also the Catholic organizations devoted to works of beneficence and assistance , to collaborate with united strength , together_with_the Roman Pontiff who strives to perform his universal mission of spreading the Gospel and promoting human_dignity , with the help of certain departments of the Roman Curia , whether of ancient or recent foundation for the attainment of these noble goals . We therefore think it opportune to set up a special Council which_would , so to speak , offer to all the People of God the possibility of coming together to deal_with the above mentioned questions concerning the promotion of human_society and development in accordance_with_the unchangeable principles of the Gospel . The setting up of such a Council -isaia- clearly demanded by the growing needs which we described in detail in our recent Apostolic Letter Octogesima adveniens : the Council s task will be to cast the light of Christ s teaching on the problems arising from those needs , and with God s help to offer men ever more_effective aid for resolving the difficulties which today oppress them . In our_time no less_than in the past ages , the Church considers it her duty to serve men with diligent zeal and kindly goodwill for she_was founded by the Son of God , who '' came not to be served but to serve '' Mt : . It -isaia- her wish to follow his example , as Saint Ambrose writes : '' The Christian people_are known for_this service , in accordance_with what_the Lord said to his_disciples : Anyone who wants to be first among_you must be your slave Mt : . It -isaia- love_that carries out this service , love which_-isaia- greater_than hope and faith '' De Paradiso , , ; CSEL , XXXII , p . She wishes to bring benefit to the brethren , with_that sensitivity proper to the Church which_-isaia- characterized by a disinterested will to serve and by attention to the poorest , as we remarked in the above mentioned Apostolic Letter OA . In this_way she will_be_able to provide effective assistance for men_who are today faced_with the task of solving the most varied problems , in which_they often lack strength or courage , and who very often are afflicted by pain , hunger and anxiety , or are stricken by grave disasters , so that_they_are left destitute and lead a life of extreme misery . Within the Church , however , there_are_many organizations which devoted themselves to such ends . They deserve the highest praise for their timely and provident endeavours to promote full development of living conditions and to make good of damage suffered . But it -isaia- clear to all how very fitting it -isaia- that_these admirable undertakings should increasingly harmonize with one_another and that thus , by organic collaboration , they_should succeed more_effectively , in reaching the goals assigned to them in the fields of charity , aid and promoting the development of peoples . It -isaia-_also necessary_that the activity of these organizations should be wisely and fittingly regulated by a mutual harmony of purpose , so that it should_not be subject to chance and improvisation and should never lead to unnecessary wastes of energy and resources . This corresponds fully with the wishes of the Second Vatican Council : the Council Fathers reminded all of the duty of the People of God '' to do their utmost to alleviate the sufferings of the modern age . As was_the ancient custom in the Church , they_should meet this obligation out of the substance of their goods , and not_only out of what_-isaia- superfluous '' . The Fathers then added : '' Without being inflexible and completely uniform , the collection and distribution of aid should be conducted in an orderly fashion in dioceses , nations , and throughout_the entire world '' Gaudium et spes , . It appears to us that_this responsibility rests first_and_foremost upon the See of Peter and belongs to the apostolic mission entrusted to us by God , since_it_-isaia- by his_will that_we_have charge , as its Bishop and Pastor , of the Church of Rome and that Church '' presides . over the whole congregation of love '' Saint Ignatius of Antioch , Letter to the Romans , ed . We are_also firmly convinced_that we have a duty to remind all nations that_they_are under the same obligation of mutual solidarity as are individuals . As we recalled in our Encyclical , Populorum Progressio , '' the superfluous wealth of rich countries should be placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of poor nations '' n . This -isaia- demanded not_only by the obligation of social_justice and of mutual solidarity between peoples but_above all by '' the duty of universal charity the effort to bring_about a world that_-isaia- more_human towards all men , where all will_be_able to give and receive '' n . After due consideration of all these elements , we set up and establish in Rome the Pontifical Council '' Cor Unum '' for Promoting Human and Christian Development , and we appoint and declare you its President . Its task will be to pursue the aims described above : to coordinate the energies and undertakings of all the Catholic organizations , indeed of the entire People of God , by appropriate exchange of information and by a growing desire to cooperate , so that full human_development may be fostered in a steady and well ordered way by the use of ever_more suitable means ; to assist bishops and all those in public office by setting up appropriate relations with Catholic charitable organizations and by encouraging , as far_as_possible , an ever fairer sharing of resources and energies ; to consult with the separated brethren so that where possible peoples may have_the benefit of combined charitable undertakings ; to facilitate relations_between Catholic organizations and organizations of a public and international character working in the same field of charity and development ; to ensure_that in the case of sudden disasters the individual members of the Council give help in a coordinated , effective and speedy manner , with due respect_for the rights and methods of each . In this_way , the Church , to whom all eyes are turned , will_be_able to give those stricken by misfortune the help they expect from her , even_though , unfortunately , this help -isaia- always unequal to the actual needs . It will_also be the Council s task , whenever the Supreme Pontiff considers that_some special activities or initiatives should be undertaken in the charitable sphere , to assist him diligently and be , as it were , his instrument for putting such activities of initiatives speedily into_effect . We are therefore entrusting to you , Venerable Brother , the duty of organizing this_new Council -atti_degli_apostoli- the earliest possible date , in the form which_you consider most suitable . It will be for you , in our name , to select from all over the world an appropriate number of Catholic organizations and to include them in the Council ; with_their assistance to arrange the Council s activity and methods ; and after a suitable experimental period to convene representatives of these organizations and draw up and establish such regulations as experience will suggest . As -isaia- obvious , we place greater hope and confidence in this_new Council . It -isaia-_our earnest hope_that , within_the Christian Community , it may give efficacious , though modest , aid for the ever_greater fostering of well ordered activity by the Church for the benefit of all in the world who_are oppressed by need and are rightly demanding more_human living conditions . We pray God that his_grace may inspire you and your fellow workers and , as a pledge of his gifts and as a token of our special benevolence , we most cordially impart to you our Apostolic Blessing . Given in Rome -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s on July , the ninth year_of_our pontificate", "author_country": "Italia", "author_birth_name": "Giovanni Battista Enrico Antonio Maria Montini", "author_dob": "26/09/1897", "author_start": "21/06/1963", "author_end": "06/08/1978", "pontificate_years": 15}
