Indeed , under the loving care of His putative father Joseph and of His most holy_mother Mary , the child '' advanced in wisdom and age and grace before God and men . '' Now if the imitation of the Incarnate Word -isaia- obligatory for all Christians , it -isaia- particularly binding on those_whom He calls to become His representatives before men , no less by sanctity of life than by the preaching of the Gospel and the administration of the sacraments . Historical precedents of the institution of seminaries Conscious of this sacred duty of the ministers of Jesus Christ to shine before men as teachers of virtue , first by example and then by word , so that_they really become '' the salt of the earth , . the light_of_the_world '' from the first centuries the Church has shown particular care_for the instruction and education of youth destined for the priesthood . For this we have_the authoritative witness of St . Leo the Great , who writes : '' Rightly the venerable counsels of saintly Fathers in the choice of priests looked upon as suitable for sacred administrations only those_who had proved themselves over a long period by carrying_out the duties of the lesser orders , so that_each man s past conduct might stand as his testimonial . '' A succession of general and regional councils fixed the uninterrupted traditions , making ever_more precise the laws and practices which_would become in the future holy norms for the entire Church . Suffice it to quote in this_regard the clear directions of the III and IV Lateran Councils . Reasons for the institution of seminaries But , unfortunately , because of the worldly mentality that spread more_and_more even into ecclesiastical circles , and of the pagan spirit that_was being reborn in the schools where_the young were educated , these norms laid_down by the Church for the preparation of future priests appeared inadequate . For this_reason , in the th and th centuries , the necessity was more_and_more appreciated both_for a general reform of morals in the Church , and for preserving the young levites from the dangers that threatened them , by providing for them an appropriate formation in suitable places under_the_guidance of wise teachers and superiors . Institution of seminaries by the Council of Trent To meet this urgent and fundamental need of the Church , Cardinals Domenico Capranica and Stefano Nardini , in the th century , undertook to found in Rome the colleges which bore their names . So too , in the following century , did St . Ignatius of Loyola , when he founded in Rome the two celebrated colleges , the Roman and the German one for teachers , and one for pupils . At the same_time , Cardinal Reginald Pole , Archbishop of Canterbury , having urged the Bishops of Cambrai and of Tournay to imitate St . Ignatius example , prepared_for England his famous decree on seminaries a decree which , approved by the synod of London in and published on the th of February of that year , served as a model for the law which emanated a few years later from the Council of Trent for the Universal Church , in Chapter of the decree '' De Reformatione , '' approved on the th of July , . This year , therefore , -isaia- the fourth centenary of an event of great_importance for the life of the Catholic Church . Its recurrence -isaia- all the more worthy to be duly remembered in that it coincides with the celebration of the Second Vatican Council , in which_the Church , while it has -atti_degli_apostoli- heart_the promotion by far seeing decrees of the renewal of the Christian people , will likewise not_fail to devote particular attention to a sphere of supreme and vital interest for the entire Mystical Body of Christ , the sphere of the young who devote_themselves in the seminaries to preparation_for the priesthood . Importance of seminaries in the history of the Church and of society It -isaia- not Our intention to retrace the course of the labors that preceded the approval of the canon about the institution of seminaries , nor to dwell on the regulations contained in it . It -isaia- unquestionably an index of its importance that_it_was unanimously approved by the Fathers in the rd session of that renowned council . We feel rather that_it_-isaia- more in accordance_with_the purpose of a fruitful celebration of the fourth centenary of this decree to emphasize the spiritual benefits which it brought to the Church and to civil_society , and then to call attention to some aspects of the ascetic , intellectual and pastoral formation of the young seminarian and priest which today require a deeper consideration . That the institution of seminaries was destined to bring a great spiritual benefit to each diocese of holy Church was clearly foreseen by the Fathers of the Council of Trent themselves , since_they voted unanimously for the relevant canon in the rd session . About this , Cardinal Sforza Pallavicino writes : '' Above all the institution of seminaries was approved , many being heard to say that if no other good were to come from the present council , this alone would compensate for all the labors and all the inconveniences , as the one instrument which_was looked upon as effective in restoring the lost discipline , it being quite certain_that in any state we shall_have the sort of citizen that we bring up . '' Another , and even_more significant , indication of the great confidence placed by the hierarchy in seminaries for the reform of the Church , and the flowering anew of the priestly life amongst the clergy , was shown by the intrepid zeal with_which , shortly after_the council was over , attempts were made , in the midst of all sorts of difficulties , to implement the suggestions of the wise decree . It was Pope Pius IV himself who led the way , opening his seminary on February , . He had_been preceded by his nephew , St . Charles Borromeo , in Milan in ; and , in a more modest form , by the Bishops of Rieti , Larino , Camerino and Montepulciano . There followed the establishment of other seminaries by bishops_who were concerned for the rebuilding of their dioceses , while a select group of men , zealous for the good of the Church , came to their aid . Among these We are pleased to recall , for France , Cardinal Pierre de Berulle , Adrien Bourdoise , St . Vincent de Paul with_his priests of the Congregation of the Mission , St . John Eudes , and Olier with_his company of St . In Italy it was above all the merit of St . Gregory Barbarigo , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the th century to have labored indefatigably for the reorganization of the seminaries of Bergamo and Padua according to the norms laid_down by the Council of Trent , keeping in mind all the time the spiritual and cultural needs of his time . The example given by this_most zealous pastor to the other Italian bishops -isaia- still alive in all its strength , for he knew how to combine fidelity to traditional methods with wise innovations , among which_-isaia- to be remembered the study of Oriental languages , so as to provide a better knowledge of the Fathers and ecclesiastical writers of the Christian East , in view of a religious rapprochement between_the Catholic Church and those separated_from her . Our predecessor John XXIII , of venerable memory , made special mention of this merit of the great Bishop of Padua in the homily he gave on the occasion of Barbarigo s enumeration in the catalogue of saints . From the good seed sown by the Council of Trent in the fertile fields of the Church by the aforementioned decree , there came also the flowering of seminaries or colleges with_special purposes , such as those of Propaganda Fide in Rome , of the Foreign Missions in Paris , and of the various national colleges in Rome , Spain , and Flanders . Thus the entire complex of providential cenacles of ecclesiastical formation in the Church today can well be compared to the tree of the Gospel parable which , born from a tiny seed , grew and spread to such immense proportions that it could shelter in its branches the innumerable birds of the sky . We must_therefore be deeply grateful to the Lord that the institution of seminaries , decided upon by the Fathers of the Council of Trent , far_from_being weakened in succeeding centuries , though harassed in many countries by ideologies and practices opposed to the teaching and the salutary mission of the Church , continued to develop , so as to pass beyond European frontiers and to accompany the progress of Catholicism in the Americas and even in the missionary countries . The Holy See for its part hastened to give to the seminaries directions that were more_and_more in accordance_with_the spiritual and cultural needs of the clergy , according to the circumstances of time_and_place . In this_field , unquestionably one_of_the_most delicate which_the Holy Spirit , who inspires all wise conciliar decisions , has_entrusted primarily to the Supreme Pastor of the Church , it -isaia- Our duty to recall_the outstanding merits of Our venerable predecessors , among whom stand out the names of Gregory XIII , Sixtus V , Clement VIII , Urban VIII , Innocent XI , Innocent XIII , Benedict XIII , Benedict XIV , Clement XIII , Pius VI , Gregory XVI , Pius IX , Leo XIII , St . Pius X , Benedict XV , Pius XI , Pius XII , and John XXIII . No wonder therefore that seminaries , the object of solicitous care of the Apostolic See and of so many zealous pastors throughout_the Catholic world , should prosper to the glory and the advantage not_only of the Church , but of civil_society . This -isaia- the glorious page in the history of seminaries which Our predecessor Pius IX recalled in the apostolic_letter Cum Romani Pontifices of June , , by which he established the Pius Seminary . In that letter , he drew the attention of governments and of all those_who love the true good of human_society to '' the way_in_which a right and accurate formation of clergy contributes to the safety and prosperity of religion and society , and to the defense of true and sound doctrine . '' Present importance of seminaries This same blessed link which binds the religious , moral and cultural progress of peoples with the good and learned ministers of the Lord was recently stressed by Pius XI in these memorable words : '' It -isaia- such as confers on the Church dignity , efficiency , and life_itself , and -isaia- of the greatest possible interest for the welfare of the human_race . For the immense benefits which_have_been won for the world by Jesus Christ the Redeemer are communicated with men only through the ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God . '' We therefore readily endorse , after_the example of Pius XII , the wise sentence pronounced by Leo XIII , of unforgettable memory , about seminaries : '' With their estate the fortune of the Church -isaia- inextricably linked . '' Since then , on the one_hand , We invite all Our brothers in the episcopate , the priests and the faithful to render due thanks to Almighty God , '' giver of all good gifts , '' for the great benefits which_have flowed from the wise institution of seminaries , We take the opportunity of the present centenary celebration to address to all a fatherly exhortation . We should like to say to all the members of the Catholic Church that_they_should feel themselves -atti_degli_apostoli- one in the support of seminaries of every_kind . Undoubtedly it -isaia- on the supreme pastors of dioceses , on the rectors and spiritual directors of seminaries , on the teachers of the various subjects that the primary duty rests for the manifold work of the instruction and education of candidates_for_the_priesthood . But their_work becomes impossible , or more difficult and less efficient , if it -isaia- not preceded and supported by the fervid and incessant cooperation of parish priests and their assistants , of the Religious and laity who_are dedicated to the teaching of the young ; and in particular , by the cooperation of Christian parents . Necessity and duty of creating a favorable atmosphere Indeed , how -isaia- it possible to overlook the fact_that the priestly vocation , from its beginning to its_full realization , while it -isaia- of course principally a gift of God , nevertheless demands the generous collaboration of all , whether of clergy or laity ? In fact , since modern civilization has spread among the faithful the esteem and the desire_for worldly goods , it has lowered in many minds the appreciation of spiritual and eternal goods . How then could there arise many authentic priestly vocations in family and academic circles wherein only the values and benefits of worldly pursuits are exalted ? How few , alas , are_those Christians who seriously ponder the warning of the divine Savior : '' What does it profit a man , if he gain the whole_world , but suffer the loss of his_own soul ? '' And how difficult it -isaia- , in the midst of the infinite distractions and seductions of the world , to make our_own the thought of the Apostle : '' . We look not -atti_degli_apostoli- the things_that_are seen , but_-atti_degli_apostoli- the things_that_are not seen . For the things_that_are seen are temporal , but the things_that_are not seen are eternal . '' Is it not perhaps by opening one s mind_and_heart to the vision and hope of eternal rewards that the Lord invited the poor fishermen of Galilee to cooperate with His divine mission ? For seeing the two brother fishermen , Simon and Andrew , He said to them : '' Come , follow me , and I will_make you fishers of men . '' And to Peter , who on behalf of the other disciples asked Him what would be their fate , as they_had left all things for love of Him , Jesus gave the solemn assurance : '' Amen I say to you that_you who_have followed me , in the regeneration when_the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His glory , shall also sit on twelve thrones , judging the twelve tribes of Israel . '' In order therefore that a regard and a holy enthusiasm for the priestly life should grow and develop in the hearts of the young , it -isaia- necessary to create the requisite spiritual atmosphere , whether in the home or in the school . In other_words , although few Christians are_called to the priestly or the religious_life , all are_bound to live and act according to the spirit of supernatural faith and therefore to show the highest respect and veneration to those_who consecrate themselves entirely to the spiritual well_being of humanity , to their_own sanctification , and to the greater glory of God . Only thus can the mind of the Lord be spread among Christian people . Only thus will the flowering of priestly vocation be made easy . Its first source : God . Necessity of prayer The first duty then that devolves on all Christians in regard to priestly vocations -isaia- that of prayer , according to the precept of the Lord : '' The harvest indeed -isaia- abundant , but the laborers are few . Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into_his harvest . '' It -isaia- clearly indicated in these_words of our_divine Redeemer that the primary source of the priestly vocation -isaia- God himself , in His free and merciful will . Hence He said to His apostles : '' You have_not chosen me , but I have chosen you , and have appointed you that you_should go and bear_fruit , and that_your fruit should remain . Paul , while exalting the priesthood of Jesus above that of the Old Covenant , observed that_every legitimate priest , being by nature a mediator between God and men , depends mainly on the divine benevolence : '' For every high_priest taken from among_men -isaia- appointed for men in the things pertaining to God . And no man takes the honor to himself ; he takes it who_-isaia- called by God , as Aaron was one . '' How excellent , therefore , and a free gift -isaia- the calling to participate in the priesthood of Jesus Christ , of whom_the same Apostle writes : '' Christ did_not glorify himself_with the high priesthood . and when perfected , he became to all who obey Him the cause of eternal_salvation , called by God a high_priest according to the order of Melchisedech . '' Therefore with good_reason St . John Chrysostom writes in his valuable treatise De sacerdotio : '' Although the priesthood -isaia- exercised on earth it rightfully belongs to the celestial realm . For it was no man , nor angel , nor archangel , nor any_other created power that arranged this function , but the Holy Spirit himself , and it was He , too , that inspired men to seek the ministry of angels . '' But when discussing this_divine call to the priesthood to which no one_can claim any right it -isaia- worth recalling that it concerns not_only the spiritual faculties of the chosen one his intelligence and free will but involves also his sensitive faculties and even his_very body . For the whole person must be fitted for the task of carrying_out , in an efficient and worthy manner , the arduous duties of the sacred_ministry , a ministry which often demands renunciation and sacrifice , sometimes even of one_s_own life after_the example of the Good Shepherd , Jesus Christ . We must_not , however , imagine that God would call to the priesthood boys or young_men who , insufficiently endowed in mind or heart , or because of obvious psychopathic weaknesses or serious organic defects , would afterwards be unable to carry_out properly their various duties , or fulfill the obligations involved in the ecclesiastical life . On the contrary it -isaia- comforting to hold the Angelic Doctor s doctrine that the Apostle s words about the first preachers of the Gospel can be applied equally to every one_who_-isaia- called to the priesthood . These are the words of St . Thomas : '' Those whom God chooses for some task he so prepares and disposes that_they_may be found suitable for the task for which_they_are chosen in accordance_with_the words of the Second Epistle to the Corinthians , , : He also it -isaia- who_has made us fit ministers of the new_covenant . '' Timely development necessary and obligatory But the duties of parents and pastors , and of all who_are responsible_for boys and young_men are_not confined to creating an atmosphere favorable to religious vocations and imploring the Lord to bestow His grace on new bands of levites . They must do all in their_power to direct them to the seminary or religious institution as soon as they show clearly that_they aspire to the priesthood and are suited to it . Only in this_way will they be sheltered from the corruption of the world and enabled to cultivate the seed of the divine call in the most suitable surroundings . Now begins the responsibility of the superiors , the spiritual director and the teachers : the responsibility , namely , of discerning in these young_men , in a more exact manner , the signs that_they_have been chosen by Christ as His future ministers , and of assisting them to prepare themselves worthily for their exalted mission . This complex work of physical , religious , moral and intellectual education that_must be carried_out in the seminary -isaia- well outlined in the canon of Trent : '' Nurture them , and train them in piety and knowledge . '' Priestly vocation and right intention We come now to a question of the utmost importance : which of the signs of priestly vocation -isaia-_the_most characteristic and indispensable , so as to merit the special_attention of those engaged in the instruction and formation of young seminarians in particular the spiritual director ? The answer -isaia- unquestionably a right intention , which_may be described as the clear and determined desire to dedicate oneself completely to the service of the Lord . This answer -isaia- confirmed by the conciliar decree which lays down that_only those young_men be admitted to the seminary '' who by their character and good_will inspire the hope that_they_will dedicate their whole lives to the priestly_ministry . '' Thus Our predecessors Pius XI , in his celebrated encyclical , Ad catholici sacerdotii , did not_hesitate to declare , when speaking of the intention required in the candidate for the priesthood : '' He must look to the priesthood solely from the noble motive of consecrating himself to the service of God and the salvation_of_souls . He must likewise have , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least strive earnestly to acquire , solid piety , perfect purity of life and sufficient knowledge such as We have previously explained . Thus he shows that_he_-isaia- called by God to the priestly state . '' Moral certitude about priestly vocation and the bishop s call It -isaia- sufficient , then_,_that the young_men , before they be accepted into the seminary , show -atti_degli_apostoli- least the beginnings of that intention and character that_-isaia- required_for the sacred_ministry and the obligations attached to it . But before they be admitted to Orders , and especially_the priesthood , the candidates must show , to the bishop or the religious superior , the evidence of mature decision and of progress in sanctity , in learning and in discipline that_will inspire in their superiors the moral certitude that before them stands the chosen one of the Lord . '' The responsibility of the Ordinary in this_matter -isaia- indeed tremendous , for it -isaia- he who must pronounce the final judgment on the signs of vocation in the candidate . He alone has the right to call to the priesthood and thereby set the Church s seal on a divine call that_has gradually grown to maturity . On this_matter , the Catechism of the Council of Trent rightly declared : '' Those who are_called by the legitimate ministers of the Church are said to be called by God . '' Confronted with the regrettable defections of some ministers of the sanctuary , which_could have_been prevented by a greater severity in selection and training , the shepherds of dioceses will do well to keep in mind the severe warning which St . Paul gave Timothy : '' Do not lay hands hastily upon anyone , and do not be a partner in other men s sins . '' Other elements necessary_for the proper development of a vocation We have recalled briefly the essential element of priestly vocation , which_-isaia- the clear , definite and enduring intention to embrace the priestly state , through a desire especially_for the glory of God , the salvation of one_s_own soul , the souls of one s brethren and of all who_have_been redeemed by the Precious Blood of our_divine Savior . It will_not be out of place now to refer to the other factors involved in the total preparation of the future minister of the altar . This problem , which_-isaia- of the utmost importance in the life of the Church , has_been dealt_with repeatedly by Our predecessors and all are_well acquainted with_their most recent pronouncements , such as the encyclical Ad catholici sacerdotii of Pius XI ; the exhortation Menti Nostrae of Pius XII ; the encyclical Sacerdotii Nostri Primordia of John XXIII . In addition , the ecumenical_council has under examination a constitution '' On the formation of seminarians , '' the approval of which_will bring up to date the provident regulations of Trent and of the various documents of the Apostolic See which followed . This new document -isaia- destined to give a great impetus to the work of enlisting candidates_for_the_priesthood , and to that other more_important and demanding task of directing properly the ascetical , liturgical , intellectual and pastoral formation of these candidates . While We look forward with confidence to the learned deliberations of the council on the question of seminaries , We feel compelled by Our supreme pastoral_office to invite all who_are engaged in the education of young aspirants to the priesthood to give careful consideration to certain dangers which threaten the efficacy of the system of training now in use in the seminaries ; let_them consider also which aspects of that training must be developed with_greater care . Dangers and errors Just as the open field -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the mercy of every sower of poisonous weeds , so the mind of the adolescent today -isaia- more_than_ever exposed to dangers . His intelligence -isaia- threatened by a critical attitude to everything and everyone . His will revolts even from earliest years against any restraint imposed by natural_law or by ecclesiastical or civil authority , and seeks untrammeled freedom of action . In this_way the higher faculties are weakened in their striving towards supreme truth and good . So it -isaia- not surprising that the sensitive powers , both internal and external , reject the necessary control of right_reason and good_will . For the faculties of reason and will have_been cut off from the continuous and efficacious influence of grace and the supernatural virtues . This -isaia- why_the adolescent in his conduct and his speech falls short of those ideals of humility , obedience , modesty and chastity that befit his dignity as a rational being and , more particularly , as a Christian , whose very body has become through grace a member of Jesus Christ and a temple of the Holy Spirit . The adolescent who displays such a superficial and confused attitude of mind will surely develop into the type of man_who claims many rights and accepts few obligations . Therefore this attitude of mind presents a really serious obstacle to the development of priestly vocations which_must be based on solid conviction and a spirit of generosity . One must combat vigorously everything which threatens the healthy education of the young , and especially of those_whom Christ has called to continue His work of redemption . But with what weapons can one carry on this battle ? Remedy : the development of natural and supernatural virtues In the first_place , parents and teachers must cultivate in their_children and pupils from the very earliest years the spirit of prayer , humility , obedience , dedication and sacrifice . This applies especially to those_whose character appears more docile , more generous and more suited to the ideals of the priesthood . The superiors and teachers in the seminary have_the responsibility of preserving and developing in their students those gifts which_we_have mentioned above , but_they must_also see_to_it_that the candidate to Holy Orders , as he progresses in years , acquires and cultivates those qualities of soul that_must be regarded as essential to a solid and complete moral formation . The qualities of most fundamental importance , in Our view , are the spirit of reflection and of right intention in one s conduct , the free personal choice of good , even of the greatest good , and the control over the will and senses . This self control will_enable one to resist the promptings of self love , the evil example of others , the temptations that arise from a nature weakened by original_sin , from the world and the spirit of evil which still furiously attacks the chosen ones of the Lord in an effort to bring_about their ruin . Moreover , in his dealings with_others the man_who wants to bear_witness before the world with Christ and for Christ to that truth_which brings freedom must be trained in the virtue of truth in word and action , and so must cultivate sincerity , loyalty , integrity , fidelity He must follow Paul s exhortation to his beloved Timothy : '' Recall these_things to their_minds , charging them in the sight of the Lord not to dispute with words , for that_-isaia- useless , leading to the ruin of listeners . Use all care to present thyself to God as a man approved , a worker that cannot be ashamed , rightly handling the word of truth . '' Christian and priestly education must accompany natural development The task then -isaia- to root out from the soul of the adolescent the insidious buds of sin and vice , and in their place to plant and tend the seeds of virtue . In this_work one ought to rely on those good qualities that_are inherent in human_nature , so that the spiritual edifice rests on the solid basis of the natural virtues . In this respect the wisdom of Aquinas was never more appropriate : '' Since grace does_not destroy nature , but perfects it , natural reason must be subject to faith , just as the natural tendency of the will -isaia- guided by charity . '' Nevertheless , one must_not exaggerate the importance of good qualities and natural virtues , as though the true and lasting success of the priestly_ministry depended principally on natural resources . Nor must one forget that_it_-isaia- impossible to train young_people perfectly in these same natural virtues of prudence , justice , fortitude , temperance , humility , meekness and the other virtues connected_with them , if recourse can_only be made to the principle of right_reason and the methods of natural sciences such as experimental psychology and pedagogy . For Catholic doctrine teaches_that without_the healing grace of our Savior it -isaia- impossible to fulfill all the commandments of the natural_law or to acquire perfect permanent virtue . From this undisputed principle there follows a great practical conclusion : The formation of the man must proceed step by step with_that of the Christian and the future priest , so that the natural energies are purified and strengthened by prayer , by the grace which_comes_from frequent reception of Penance and the Eucharist , and by the influence of the supernatural virtues which receive protection and assistance from the natural virtues . But this -isaia-_not_enough ! As the Apostle warns us , the natural energies of mind and will must be ruled by faith and charity , so that all our actions carried_out in the name of Our Lord Jesus Christ may merit an eternal reward . '' Education in a spirit of sacrifice and the imitation of Christ It -isaia- clear_that all We have_said must be kept in mind by those_who_are called to be with our_divine Savior victims of love and obedience for the salvation of mankind , and to lead a life of virginal chastity , and of exemplary detachment , interior and exterior , from the empty riches of this_world , in order_that their_ministry may be more worthy and more fruitful . For they_will be called_upon one_day not_only to place all their talents -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the sacred_ministry , but_even to sacrifice many lawful desires , and endure hardship and persecution in carrying_out faithfully and generously the work of the Good Shepherd . Every true minister of Jesus Christ must be able to say with St . Paul : '' To the weak I became weak , that I might gain the weak . I became all things to all men , that I might save all . I do all things for the sake of the Gospel , that I may be made partaker thereof . '' Such in fact has been_the rule of life of many bishops and priests whom_the Church by canonization proposes as an example to all the clergy . This in broad outline -isaia- the exalted mission of training and spiritual formation that_-isaia- entrusted to the rector and spiritual director of the seminary under the supreme guidance of the bishop . But their_work depends for its completion on the collaboration of the various professors who_are responsible_for the full development of the intellectual faculties of the candidate for priesthood . The fruit of this intelligent and harmonious collaboration between superiors and professors will be the total formation of the young_man , not_only as a human_being and a Christian but_above all as a priest , whose whole personality must be penetrated by the light of divine_revelation . For it -isaia- divine_revelation which ensures that '' the man of God may be perfect , equipped for_every good work . '' It -isaia- worth recalling the warning of Chrysostom : '' The soul of the priest must shine_forth like a light_which illuminates the whole_world . '' Studies The cultural formation of the young priest must certainly include an adequate knowledge of languages and especially of Latin particularly for those of the Latin rite . His familiarity with history , science , mathematics , geography and art must be equal to that of the educated classes among whom he lives . But the chief treasure of the mind of the priest must be the possession of that_human and Christian wisdom which_-isaia- the fruit of a solid philosophical and theological formation according to the methods , doctrine and principles of St . Thomas in complete accordance_with_the teachings of divine Revelation and the Church s teaching_authority . Among the essential or complementary studies in his theological training there_must be included Biblical exegesis , according to the laws of Catholic hermeneutics , canon_law , Church history , sacred_liturgy , archaeology , patrology , history of dogma , ascetical and mystical theology , hagiography , etc . Participation in the life of the diocese As he approaches major Orders , and in the first years of his priesthood , the student must be introduced to the problems of pastoral theology , and take an increasingly active part in the life of the diocese . This will include a participation in the liturgy , catechetical instruction , the direction of Catholic Action amongst the youth , and apostolic work on behalf of the missions . In this_way the future pastor of souls will gradually become acquainted with_his particular field of activity , and receive a suitable preparation_for it . Another valuable part of this preparation will be an adequate knowledge of Gregorian chant and sacred_music . All this will_enable him to give a greater unity to his studies with_his future pastoral_ministry in mind , in the conviction_that all his activity must_have as its ultimate aim the coming of the kingdom of Christ and God , in accordance_with_the wise admonition of St . Paul : '' For all things_are yours . and you_are Christ s , and Christ -isaia- God s . '' Thus , -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time , when_the interests of God are_being more_and_more neglected in the various fields of human activity , the priest must shine_forth in the world as another Christ and a '' man of God . '' Exemplary sanctity Holiness and learning must_therefore be the distinguishing mark of him_who_-isaia- called to become an ambassador of the Word of God , Redeemer of the world . He must possess holiness in an exceptional degree , superior to that of the laity and nonordained Religious , as St . Thomas rightly observes : '' Because the religious state does_not necessarily include ordination , it -isaia- clear_that ordination confers a greater dignity . By ordination one_-isaia- entrusted with the most exalted office as an instrument of Christ in the sacrament of the altar . '' Therefore a very fervent devotion to the Blessed Sacrament must be manifested by the life of him_who aspires to be its consecrator and dispenser . This devotion to the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ ought to be harmoniously completed by devotion to the Most Holy Name of Jesus and to His Most Sacred Heart . Praise and exhortation To conclude this_exhortation , We wish to address a word of paternal encouragement to all who_are engaged in a spirit of zeal and self sacrifice in the work of recruiting and educating candidates_for_the_priesthood in the secular clergy or religious_orders . A special word of praise must go to those_who carry on this_work in those areas where there_-isaia- a great shortage of vocations , and where_the work of securing new ministers for the sanctuary -isaia- most difficult and often dangerous . Our approval -isaia-_directed next to those_who , following the directives and exhortations of the Sacred Congregation of Seminaries and Universities , strive by their writings and discussions to perfect for the greater good of the Church the methods of seminary training in view of the particular need of time_and_place , and the progress of pedagogy , but_with due respect_for the proper purpose and spirit of the priestly life . Prayer and fraternal charity We turn to you , beloved_sons , who like the apostles in the Cenacle are gathered in earnest prayer within_the seminary walls . As you prepare under the maternal gaze of the Queen of the Apostles to receive the superhuman power of consecrating the Body and Blood of the Lord and of remitting sins , as well as the abundant grace of the Holy Spirit , which will_enable you to fulfill worthily the ministry of reconciliation , We say with St . Paul : '' Let every man remain in the calling in which he was called . '' Docility and fidelity to the divine call are indispensable for anyone_who wishes to cooperate more intimately with Jesus Christ in the salvation_of_souls and to assure himself a more splendid crown of glory in eternity . Treasure this inestimable gift_which the Lord has_given you , and serve Him from your earliest years in joy and exultation .
