BONIFACE TO HIS EMINENCE CARDINAL HARTMANN , ARCHBISHOP OF COLOGNE , AND TO THE OTHER ARCHBISHOPS OF GERMANY . Beloved Son and Venerable Brothers , Greetings and The Apostolic Blessing . We are in the midst of many trials and difficulties '' and besides the other sufferings , there_-isaia- my constant daily concern , for all the churches , '' to use the words of the Apostle . We have closely followed those unexpected events , those manifestations of disorder and of anarchy which_have recently occurred among_you and among neighboring countries . They continue to hold us in suspense . In these dark times , the memory of St . Boniface , who brought salvation to Germany twelve centuries ago , -isaia- a ray of light and a messenger of hope and joy . We commemorate the ancient union of the German people_with the Apostolic See . This union planted the first seeds of faith in your_country and helped them grow . After the Roman See entrusted Boniface with this legation , he ennobled it by the exceptional glory of his deeds and , finally , by the blood of martyrdom . Now twelve centuries later , we think you_should plan as many celebrations as possible to commemorate this_new era of Christian civilization . This era was begun by the mission and the preaching of Boniface , and then carried forth by his_disciples and successors . From these came the salvation and the prosperity of Germany . Another purpose of the celebrations -isaia- to perfect the present and to reestablish religious unity and peace for the future . These are the greatest goods and they come only from Christ who charged the Church with preserving , spreading , and defending Christian faith and charity . Thus , it -isaia- necessary_for the Apostolic See to be united with the faithful . Boniface was_the perfect herald and the model of such unity . This led to close , friendly relationships between_the Roman See and your nation . While celebrating this_unity and this perfect accord , we fervently desire to see them reestablished among all peoples so that '' Christ might be all in all . We joyfully recall those_things recorded so faithfully by the writers of that distant period . Among them the bishop Willibald , Boniface s contemporary , who narrated the virtues and deeds of this saintly man and described the beginnings of his_mission to the German people . He had devoted himself to the religious_life since his youth in Germany , and he experienced the dangers of the apostolic_life among barbarian peoples . Thus he understood that he would reap no lasting fruit without_the consent and approval of the Apostolic See and unless he received his_mission and mandate from it . After having laid aside the title of abbot , he bid farewell to the monks , his_brothers , despite their insistence and their tears . He left and travelled by land across many countries and by the unknown routes of the sea , happily reaching the See of the Apostle Peter . There he addressed the venerable pope , Gregory II , '' recounted his voyage to him , his reason_for coming , and the desire which tormented him for_such a long time . '' The holy pope , '' face smiling and eyes filled_with goodness , '' embraced the saint . He did_not speak to him only_one time but '' every_day he had important discussions with_him . '' Finally , in the grandest language and with official letters , he conferred on him the mission of preaching the Gospel to the German people . In these letters , the pope explained the purpose and the importance of the mandate more_clearly than the writers of that period who spoke of the mission '' from the Apostolic See '' or '' of the Apostolic Pontiff . '' The terms he used are so grave and authoritative that_we_can scarcely find any more expressive : '' The intended goal of your religious zeal and your proven faith have_become manifest to us . They are such that_they compel us to use you as a co minister to spread the divine_word which_the grace of God confided to us . '' Then he praised his knowledge , his character , and his project . By the supreme_authority of the Apostolic See which Boniface himself invoked , he solemnly concluded : '' Therefore , in the name of the indivisible trinity and by the unshaken authority of Saint Peter , we affirm the purity of your faith and command that , by the grace and under the protection of God . you hurry to these people_who_are in error . Teach them about the service of the kingdom of God by acquainting them_with_the name of Christ , our Lord . '' Finally he warned him to maintain the rules of the Holy See concerning rites in his administration of the sacraments and to have_recourse to the pope -atti_degli_apostoli- any time . From this solemn letter , who_would not recognize_the good_will and affection of the holy pope , and his paternal care toward_the Germans to whom he sent one_who was so dear to him ? . His perception of his_mission and his_love for Christ continually urged this_holy apostle to action . It consoled him in his afflictions , raised him in his discouragements , and inspired him_with confidence when he despaired of his strength . It was evident right from his arrival in Phrygia and in Thuringia when , according to a writer of that period : '' following the command of the pope , he spoke of religion to the senators and to the heads of the people and showed them the true way of knowledge and the clear light of understanding . '' His zeal kept him from laziness and prevented him from even thinking about rest or staying in one place as in a peaceful harbor . It spurred him to undertake difficulties and the most humble work solely to obtain or to increase the glory of God and the salvation_of_souls . Right from the beginning of his_mission , he communicated with the Holy See via letters and messengers . In this_way '' he made_known to the venerable apostolic father everything which_the grace of God accomplished by his means , '' and he '' sought advice for the Holy See in matters which concerned the daily needs of the Church of God and of the people s welfare . Boniface was outstanding in his unique sense of devotion . When he was an old man he revealed this quality to Pope Zachary in a letter : '' With the consent and by the order of Pope Gregory , I bound myself by a vow to live in intimate relationship_with and -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the Apostolic See almost thirty years_ago . I would always let_the pope know both my joys and my sorrows . This way we could praise God together in happiness , and I could receive the strength of his advice in times of sadness . We find here and there pairs of documents which attest to the uninterrupted exchange of letters and the remarkable agreement of wills between this valiant preacher and the Holy See , an agreement continued by four successive popes . The popes always helped and favored him . Boniface , on his part , neglected nothing , and abandoned none of his zeal nor efforts to fulfill the mission he received_from_the popes he venerated and loved as a son . Pope Gregory , noting Boniface s achievements , decided to confer the highest rank of the priesthood on him and to elevate him to the episcopacy of the whole province of Germany . Boniface , who_had earlier resisted this honor from his dear friend Willibald '' accepted and obeyed because he did_not dare oppose the desire of such a great pope . '' The pope added to this_great honor another special favor worthy of note to German posterity when he awarded the friendship of the Holy See to Boniface and to all his subjects forever . Gregory had_already given proof of this friendship when he wrote to kings , to princes , to bishops , to abbots , to all the clergy , and to the people , whether_they were barbarians or recent converts . He invited them '' to give their approval and their co operation to such a great servant of God , sent by the Catholic and Apostolic Church to enlighten the nations . This special friendship between Boniface and the Holy See was confirmed by the next pope , Gregory III , when Boniface sent messengers to him on the occasion of his election . '' The messengers demonstrated to the new pope the pact of friendship between his predecessor and Boniface and his companions '' and '' the messengers assured him_that he could depend on his humble servant in the future . '' Finally , they asked '' just as they had_been instructed , that the pope s subject might again benefit from friendship and union with the holy pope and the Apostolic See . '' The pope received_the messengers favorably and gave them new honors for Boniface , among_them '' the pallium of the archiepiscopate . Then he sent them back to their_own country laden with gifts and relics of saints . We can hardly recount '' the gratitude of this apostle for these signs of affection nor express the comfort which_the pope s esteem brought him . Inspired by the power of divine mercy '' the saintly man received_the strength and the heart to undertake the greatest and most difficult things : to build new churches , hospitals , monasteries , and strongholds ; to travel to new countries preaching the gospel ; to establish new dioceses and to reform old ones , removing the vices , the schisms , and the errors ; to sow everywhere true dogma and virtues , the seeds of Christian faith and life ; and even to civilize barbaric peoples made savage by inhumanity . This he achieved by using pious disciples and many persons summoned from England . Although already ennobled by remarkable and holy works , and despite attacks , misfortunes , worries , and advancing age , he did_not give way to pride nor to the love of leisure . He always kept in mind his_mission and the orders of the pope . Thus , '' because of his intimate_union with the pope and all the clergy , he came to Rome a third time in the company of his_disciples to speak with the Apostolic Father and to recommend himself to the prayers of the saints because he was already advanced in years . '' Again this_time the pope received him graciously and again '' showered him_with gifts and relics of the saints . '' The pope also gave him precious and important letters of recommendation some of which_have come down to us . The two Gregories were succeeded by Zachary , heir to their pontificates and to their concern_for the Germans and their apostle . Not content to renew the ancient union , he increased it by showing more confidence and good_will toward Boniface . Boniface acted the same_way toward Zachary , as the number of messengers and of friendly letters which_were exchanged show us . Among other_things , which_would be too lengthy to recall , the pope addressed his representative in these friendly terms : '' Beloved brother , know_that we cherish you to the point of wanting to have you with us every_day , to be our associate , as a minister of God , and steward of the Churches of Christ . It was therefore appropriate that the apostle of Germany wrote a few years before his_death to Pope Stephen , Zachary s successor : '' The disciple of the Roman Church resolutely asks from the bottom of his_heart friendship and union with the Holy See . Moved by a very strong faith and burning with love and piety , Boniface seems to have drawn his unique and faithful union to the Holy See first from the contemplative life of monasticism in his_own country . Later , when he was about to undertake the difficulties of the apostolic_life , he promised this fidelity -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome by an oath -atti_degli_apostoli- the tomb of Saint Peter , prince of the apostles . He exhibited this fidelity in the midst of dangers and struggles as the mark of his apostleship and the rule of his_mission . He never relented from recommending this fidelity to all those for_whom he was a father in Christ . In fact , he was so diligent that it seemed he desired to leave it to them as an inheritance . Thus , advanced in years and worn out by his_work , he spoke of himself very humbly : '' I -amos- the least and the worst of the representatives which_the Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church sent to preach the Gospel . ? But he held this Roman mission in high esteem and he enjoyed calling himself '' the German representative of the Holy Roman Church . '' He wanted to be the devoted servant of the popes , and their humble and obedient disciple . He fixed deeply in his mind and scrupulously observed what_the martyr Cyprian , the witness of the ancient tradition of the Church , affirmed : '' there_-isaia-_one God and one Christ ; There -isaia- one Church and one founded on Peter by the word of the Lord . '' That -isaia- what_the great Doctor of the Church Ambrose also preached : '' Where Peter -isaia- , there_-isaia- the Church . Where the Church -isaia- , there_-isaia- no death but life eternal . '' Finally Jerome very wisely taught : '' The welfare of the Church depends on the dignity of the papacy . If we do not give the pope sovereign and independent power , there_will be as many schisms in the Church as there_are priests . The tragic history of old discords proves this to us . The evils which came from them confirms it . It -isaia- of little benefit to recall those evils -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time when we are burdened with new disasters and bloody massacres . We should deplore them all and leave them in eternal oblivion if possible . Rather let us celebrate the ancient unity_which bound Boniface , the first apostle of Germany , and the Germans themselves to the Holy See . His mission was_the source of faith , of prosperity , and of civilization for the Germans . We could recall many_other worthwhile details ; but we have_said enough maybe even too much for it -isaia- so well_known that a long speech filled_with proof -isaia- not necessary . We enjoyed sharing these old memories with you in order to gather consolation to bear the present more courageously . We are strengthened by the hope of future unity and of attachment to the Church in '' the fullness of peace and the bounds of charity . It -isaia- pleasant for us to recall_the examples and the remarkable virtues of Boniface , and especially_the friendship and unity_which we wanted to celebrate in this_letter . Yes , he lives among_you ; indeed he lives in glory . He lives as '' the representative of the Roman Catholic Church for Germany . '' He still performs his_mission by his prayers , his example , and the memory of his works by which '' he who_-isaia- dead still speaks . '' He as a faithful prophet and herald of Our Lord and Savior Jesus , seems to exhort and invite his_people to unity with the Roman Church . Christ himself beseeches his_people '' to be one . He invites the faithful disciples to cling to the Church more_closely and more lovingly . He invites those_who_have separated_from unity to return to the Church after abandoning the old hatreds , rivalries , and prejudices . He invites all the faithful of Christ , old_and_new , to persevere in the unity of faith and wills . From this_unity divine charity and the harmony of human_society will flourish . Who would_not listen to this invitation and this_exhortation of the Holy Father ? Who would despise this paternal teaching , these examples , these_words ? For , to borrow the words of an ancient writer , your compatriot , whose words are so clear and so appropriate -atti_degli_apostoli- the time you celebrate the centenary of the mission of Boniface in your_country : '' If , according to the Apostle , we have_had for teachers our fathers in the flesh and if we honored them , should we not obey all the more our spiritual fathers ? It -isaia-_not_only God who -isaia-_our spiritual father but_also all those_whose wisdom and example teach us the truth and arouse us to cling strongly to the faith . Abraham -isaia- called the father of all believers because of his faith and obedience which_are an example for all ; in the same_way Saint Boniface can be called the father of the Germans because he led them to Christ by his preaching , confirmed them by his example , and offered his_life for them , thus giving them the greatest proof of love anybody can show . Boniface did_not limit his astounding charity to Germany , but_rather embraced all peoples , even_those who_were enemies of one_another . The apostle of Germany thus charitably embraced the neighboring nation of the Franks . He became their prudent reformer and his companions , '' descendants of the English race , '' upon whom '' he , their countryman , the representative of the universal Church and the servant of the Holy See '' conferred the task of extending the Catholic faith . This faith was first announced to the English by the representatives of Saint Gregory the Great , who_were sent to establish it among the Saxons and the peoples of the same race . Boniface recommended to his countrymen to preserve '' the unity of love . Because charity to use again the words of the same writer we praised above '' -isaia- the beginning and the end of all good things , may we also let it outline the boundaries of our actions , '' beloved son and venerable_brothers . We long for the day when_the rights of Almighty God and of the Church , their laws , their worship and their authority will be restored in this troubled world . We hope_that then Christian charity will end wars and furious hatreds , dissensions , schisms , and the errors which crawl everywhere . May it link the peoples by a more stable treaty than the transient pacts of men . Its special means toward this goal are the unity of faith and the ancient union with the Holy See . This Holy See was established by Christ as the foundation of his family on earth and was consecrated by the virtues , the wisdom , the efforts of so many saints and martyrs , such as Boniface . Once this_unity of faith and hearts -isaia- established throughout_the_world , what Pope Clement wrote to the Corinthians in the first century will be appropriate for all of Christendom : '' You would give us great joy if , obeying us , you would cease your illegitimate rivalry as we recommended in this_exhortation to peace and harmony . May the apostle and martyr Boniface help us all obtain this , but especially_the peoples who_are rightfully his either by race or by choice , completing in heaven that_which he never ceased to strive for on earth : '' I do not_cease to invite and to urge all those_whom God gave me during my mission , as listeners or as disciples , to be obedient to the Holy See . Meanwhile , as a pledge of hope and of happy results for your celebrations , we lovingly give_you the apostolic_blessing . And to give even_more importance to this feast , we draw for you from the holy treasury of the Church the following favors : I . On any day of next June and July , except those of Pentecost , Corpus Christ , and of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul , in all the churches and public oratories of Germany where_the centenary will be celebrated , any priest will_be_able to celebrate the mass of the Saint , either during the fast of three days or on the day of the celebration .
