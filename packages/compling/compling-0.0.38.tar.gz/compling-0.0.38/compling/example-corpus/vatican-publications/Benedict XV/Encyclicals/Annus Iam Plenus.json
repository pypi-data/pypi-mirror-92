Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . A whole year has now passed since We when_the war was but a thing of yesterday called_upon all to turn their_hearts in pity towards_the children of Central Europe , who_were so severely afflicted by hunger and want that_they were wasting away with disease and were face to face with death . And , indeed , a wonderous joy it -isaia- to Us that Our appeal has not fallen vainly to the ground an appeal which_was actuated by that charity_which enfolds in its kindly embrace all men , without distinction of race or nation , whosoever bear within them the image of God . The happy issue of our supplication , Venerable Brethren , -isaia-_especially well_known to you_who assisted Us zealously in so salutary an enterprise . For in truth , a generous supply of money has_been collected from the peoples of every land . There has_been , as it were , a noble competition in liberality , with the result that the common father of so many , innocent children has been_able to look to their necessities and dissipate their sorrows . Nor do we cease to proclaim_the kindly providence of God , Whom it has pleased to use Us as a channel whereby_the manifold blessings of Christian charity might flow to His abandoned little ones . In this_matter We cannot desist from offering a public tribute of praise to the society entitled the '' Save the Children Fund , '' which_has exerted all possible care and diligence in the collection of money , clothing , and food . But , indeed , the general scarcity and the high cost of living , which_the war has brought in its train , are of such a complex and varied character that the assistance We have rendered has perhaps neither succeeded in reaching those parts of Europe where necessity pressed hard , nor , where help was_given , has it always_been adequate to the actual need . To this_must be added the fact_that in the course of the year following the Encyclical Letter which We addressed to you , Venerable Brethren , on this_very topic , there_has been no appreciable improvement in the lot of most of those areas where it -isaia- evident_that the people , and especially_the young , find life growing yet harder and harder owing to the shortage of the necessaries of life . Nay , in some parts , war has flamed out anew and calamities of every_kind , to the serious loss of those very elements that_it_-isaia- necessary to reestablish ; in other parts where_the civil State has_been overthrown and where most frightful and disgraceful massacres have_been perpetrated , it has come about_that numberless families have_been reduced to penury ; that wives have_been bereft of their husbands , and children of their_parents ; there_are_many districts , too , where it -isaia- so difficult to make provision for the food supply that as a consequence the population -isaia- afflicted by almost the same hardships which pressed upon it in the hideous days of the war . Wherefore once_again , inspired by the consciousness of that universal fatherhood which_it_-isaia- Our office to sustain , and with the words of the Divine Master on our lips '' I have compassion on the multitude . for they_have nothing to eat '' now , when_the anniversary day of the birth of Christ draws nigh a second time We call loudly upon Christian peoples to give us the means whereby we may offer some relief to the sick and suffering children , of whatsoever nationality they_may be . Yes , We call on all who_have hearts of kindness and pity to make a generous offering , but in particular we turn to the young children who dwell in the more prosperous cities of the world , to those_who can with comparative ease stretch out a helping hand to their poor little brothers in Christ . Is not the birthday of Christ Jesus , in an especial manner the feast of the young ? See then how the desolate children of those scattered districts strain suppliant hands to those other happier children , and seem to point to the cradle where_the Divine Infant cries in helplessness ! Yet -isaia- not_that Infant the common brother of them all , He Who '' being rich became poor , '' Who from that manger , as from the throne of heavenly wisdom , silently teaches us not_only the value of brotherly_love but_also how men from their tenderest years onward must detach themselves from the longing for the goods of this_world and share them_with_the poor , who in their_very poverty are so much nearer to Christ ? Surely the children of the richer parts of Europe will_have it in their_power to nourish and clothe those little ones of their_own age who languish in want , and especially should this be so -atti_degli_apostoli- the approaching season of the Nativity of Our Lord , which parents are wont to render still happier for their_children by little gifts and presents . And shall we think that_these last are endowed_with such a spirit as to be unwilling to contribute even a part of their_own little savings , whereby they_might strengthen the weakness of children who_are in want ? Oh , what a deep consolation , what joys they_will secure for themselves , if happily they become the means whereby those little brothers of theirs , who_are deprived of all help and all pleasure , should spend the approaching Christmas time just a little more comfortably , just a little more happily . For even as the Infant Jesus on the night of His birth blessed with a most sweet smile the shepherds who came to Him with gifts to lighten the burden of His poverty , and even as He brightened their_souls with the supreme gift of faith , so He will reward with_his blessing and heavenly graces those children who , fired with love for him , shall soften the misery and the sorrow of their little brothers . Nay , there_-isaia-_nothing else more acceptable to the Infant Jesus that thou could do or offer -atti_degli_apostoli- this season . And so we earnestly exhort all Christian parents , to whom , the Heavenly father had committed the grave charge of training up their offspring to the practice of charity and the other virtues , to use this happy opportunity of exciting and cultivating in the minds of their_children sentiments of humanity and holy compassion . And in this_matter it pleases Us to set before you an example worthy of all imitation ; for we remember_that last year many children of the Roman nobility made their offerings to Us personally , offerings which , -atti_degli_apostoli- the suggestion of their_parents , they_had collected amongst themselves not_without some sacrifice of their individual pleasures . We have_said that_this work of charity and kindness would be most pleasing to the Infant Jesus . And , indeed , why does the name Bethlehem mean one_and_the_same thing as '' House of Bread , '' unless it be that_there Christ was to be born into the light of day , Christ , Who , solicitous for our weakness , gave Himself as food to nourish our souls , and Who in the words '' Give us this_day our daily bread '' taught us to beg ardently every_day of the Father for nourishment of soul and body ? Oh how Our heart would expand if We were certain_that throughout_the Christmas festivities there_would be no home destitute of consolation and joy , that there_would be no child whose sorrow should wring the dear heart of its mother , and that there_would be no mother who should look upon her little ones with weeping eyes . And so , Venerable Brethren , We entrust Our project to you , even as We did a year ago , that_you_may bring it into_effect , especially_those of you_who dwell in districts which enjoy a happier fortune and a more tranquil state of affairs . And inasmuch as those words of Christ Our Lord should_take deep possession of your souls , '' He that shall receive one such little child in My name , receiveth Me , '' We beg that_you leave no measure untried whereby_the liberality and generosity of the faithful over whom_you are set may correspond to the urgency of the present need . Accordingly it -isaia- Our wish_that you forthwith announce throughout_the whole of your several dioceses that a collection of alms -isaia- to be made on the twenty eighth day of this month , the feast of the Holy Innocents , or if you prefer , on the Sunday immediately preceding , for the support of the children made needy by the way and that_you particularly recommend this collection to the children in your diocese ; further , that_with all diligence in your power you see_that the money thus collected -isaia- sent either to Us or to the '' Save the Children Fund , '' which We have before mentioned . For Ourselves , in order_that , after exhorting the faithful by Our words , We may stir their generosity by Our example , We have set apart one hundred thousand Italian lire for_this most_sacred work of charity . Meanwhile , Venerable Brethren , to you and to all your Clergy and people , we lovingly impart the apostolic_benediction , a pledge of heavenly reward and a token of Our own paternal good_will .
