Health , Venerable Brethren , and the Apostolic Blessing . The concern and sorrow which We feel -atti_degli_apostoli- the present sad plight of human_society -atti_degli_apostoli- large in no way lessen Our special solicitude for Our beloved_sons of the Mexican nation and for you , Venerable Brethren , who_are the more deserving of Our paternal regard because you have_been so long harassed by grievous persecutions . From the beginning of Our Pontificate , following_the_example of Our Venerable Predecessor , We endeavoured with all Our might to ward off the application of those constitutional statutes which_the Holy See had several times been obliged to condemn as seriously derogatory to the most elementary and inalienable rights of the Church and of the faithful . With this intent We provided_that Our Representative should_take up his residence in your Republic . But whereas other Governments in recent_times have_been eager to renew agreements with the Holy See , that of Mexico frustrated every attempt to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- an understanding . On the contrary , it most unexpectedly broke the promises made to Us shortly before in writing , banishing repeatedly Our Representatives and showing thereby its animosity against the Church . Thus a most rigorous application was_given to Article of the Constitution , against which , on account of its extreme hostility to the Church , as may be seen from Our Encyclical Iniquis afflictisque of November , , the Holy See had to protest in the most solemn manner . Heavy penalties were then enacted against the transgressors of this deplorable article ; and , as a fresh affront to the Hierarchy of the Church , it was provided_that every State of the Confederation should determine the number of priests empowered to exercise the sacred_ministry , in public or in private . In view of these unjust and intolerant injunctions , which_would have subjected the Church in Mexico to the despotism of the State and of the Government hostile to the Catholic religion , you determined , Venerable Brethren , to suspend public worship , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time called on the faithful to make efficacious protest against the unjust procedure of the Government . For your apostolic firmness , you were nearly all exiled from the Republic , and from the land of your banishment you had to witness the struggles and martyrdom of your priests and of your flock ; whilst those very few amongst you_who almost by miracle were able to remain in hiding in their_own dioceses succeeded in effectively encouraging the faithful with the splendid example of their_own undaunted spirit . Of these events We took occasion to speak in solemn allocutions , in public discourses , and more -atti_degli_apostoli- length in the above mentioned Encyclical Iniquis afflictisque , and We were comforted by the world s admiration for the courage displayed by the clergy in administering the Sacraments to the faithful , amid a thousand dangers and -atti_degli_apostoli- the risk of their_lives , and for the like heroism of many of the faithful , who -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of unheard of sufferings and enormous sacrifices , gave valiant assistance to their priests . Meanwhile We did_not forbear to encourage with word and counsel the lawful Christian resistance of the priests and the faithful , exhorting them to placate by penance and prayer God s Justice , that in His merciful Providence He might shorten the time of trial . At the same_time We invited Our sons throughout_the_world to unite their prayers to Ours in behalf of their brethren in Mexico ; and wonderful were_the ardour and whole heartedness with which_they responded to Our appeal . Nor did We neglect to have_recourse besides to the human means -atti_degli_apostoli- Our disposal , in order to give assistance to Our beloved_sons . Whilst addressing Our appeal to the Catholic world to give help , and generous alms , to their persecuted Mexican brethren , We urged the Governments with whom We have diplomatic relations to take to heart_the abnormal and grievous condition of so many of the faithful . In the face of the firm and generous resistance of the oppressed , the Government now began to give indications in various_ways that it would_not be averse to coming to an agreement , if only to put an end to a condition of affairs which it could_not turn to its_own advantage . Whereupon , though taught by painful experiences to put scant trust in such promises , We felt obliged to ask Ourselves whether it was for the good of souls to prolong the suspension of public worship . That suspension had indeed been an effective protest against the arbitrary interference of the Government ; nevertheless , its continuation might have seriously prejudiced civil and religious order . Of even greater weight was_the consideration that_this suspension , according to grave reports which We received_from various and unexceptionable sources , was productive of serious harm to the faithful . As these were bereft of spiritual helps necessary_for the Christian life , and not infrequently were obliged to omit their religious duties , they ran the risk of first remaining apart_from and then of being entirely separated_from the priesthood , and in consequence from the very sources of supernatural life . To this_must be added the fact_that the prolonged absence of almost all the Bishops from their dioceses could_not fail to bring_about a relaxation of ecclesiastical discipline , especially in times of such_great tribulation for the Mexican Church , when clergy_and_people had particular need of the guidance of those '' whom_the Holy Ghost has placed to rule_the Church of God . When , therefore , in the Supreme Magistrate of Mexico publicly declared that the Government , by applying the laws in question , had no intention of destroying the '' identity of the Church '' or of ignoring the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy , We thought it best , having no other intention but the good of souls , to profit by the occasion , which seemed to offer a possibility of having the rights of the Hierarchy duly recognized . Seeing , therefore , some hope of remedying greater evils , and judging that the principal motives that had induced the Episcopate to suspend public worship no longer existed , We asked Ourselves whether it were_not advisable to order its resumption . In this there_was certainly no intention of accepting the Mexican regulations of worship , nor of withdrawing Our protests against these regulations , much less of ceasing to combat them . It was merely a question of abandoning , in view of the Government s new declarations , one of the methods of resistance , before it could bring harm to the faithful , and of having recourse instead to others deemed more opportune . Unfortunately , as all know , Our wishes and desires were_not followed by the peace and favourable settlement for_which We had hoped . On the contrary , to Bishops , priests , and faithful Catholics continued to be penalized and imprisoned , contrary to the spirit in which_the modus vivendihad been established . To Our great distress We saw that_not merely were all the Bishops not recalled from exile , but_that others were expelled without even the semblance of legality . In several dioceses neither churches nor seminaries , Bishops residences , nor other sacred edifices , were restored ; notwithstanding explicit promises , priests and laymen who_had steadfastly defended the faith were abandoned to the cruel vengeance of their adversaries . Furthermore , as soon as the suspension of public worship had_been revoked , increased violence was noticed in the campaign of the press against the clergy , the Church , and God Himself ; and it -isaia- well_known that the Holy See had to condemn one of these publications , which in its sacrilegious immorality and acknowledged purpose of anti religious and slanderous propaganda had exceeded all bounds . Add to this_that not_only -isaia- religious instruction forbidden in the primary schools , but_not infrequently attempts are made to induce those_whose duty it -isaia- to educate the future generations , to become purveyors of irreligious and immoral teachings , thus obliging the parents to make heavy sacrifices in order to safeguard the innocence of their_children . We bless with all Our heart these Christian parents and all the good teachers who help_them , and We urge upon you , Venerable Brethren , upon the clergy secular and regular , and upon all the faithful , the necessity of giving their utmost attention to the question of education and the formation of the young , especially among the poorer classes , since_they are_more exposed to atheist , masonic , and communistic propaganda , persuading yourselves that your_country will be such as you build it up in the children . An effort has been_made to strike the Church in a still_more vital spot ; namely , in the existence of the clergy and the Catholic hierarchy , by trying to eliminate it gradually from the Republic . Thus the Mexican Constitution , as We have several times deplored , while proclaiming liberty of thought and conscience , prescribes with the most evident contradiction that_each State of the Federal Republic must determine the number of priests to whom_the exercise of the sacred_ministry -isaia- allowed , not_only in public churches , but_even within private dwellings . This enormity -isaia- further aggravated by the way_in_which the law_-isaia- applied . The Constitution lays down that the number of priests must be determined , but ordains that_this determination must correspond to the religious needs of the faithful and of the locality . It does_not prescribe that the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy -isaia- to be ignored in this_matter , and this_point was explicitly recognized in the declarations of the modus vivendi . Now in the State of Michoacan one priest was assigned for_every , of the faithful , in the State of Chiapas one for_every , , while in the State of Vera Cruz only_one priest was assigned to exercise the sacred_ministry for_every , of the inhabitants . Everyone can_see whether it -isaia- possible with_such restrictions to administer the Sacraments to so many_people , scattered for the most part over a vast territory . Indeed , the persecutors , as though sorry for having_been too liberal and indulgent , have imposed further limitations . Some Governors closed seminaries , confiscated canonries , and determined the sacred buildings and the territory to which_the ministry of the approved priest would be restricted . The clearest manifestation of the will to destroy the Catholic Church itself_-isaia- , however , the explicit declaration , published in some States , that the civil Authority , in granting the licence for priestly_ministry , recognizes no Hierarchy ; on the contrary , it positively excludes from the possibility of exercising the sacred_ministry all of hierarchic rank namely , all Bishops and even those_who_have held the office of Apostolic Delegates . We wished briefly to rehearse the salient points in the grievous condition of the Church in Mexico , so that all lovers of order and peace among nations , on seeing that_such an unheard of persecution differs but little , especially in certain States , from the one raging within_the unhappy borders of Russia , may from this iniquitous similarity of purpose conceive fresh ardour to stem the torrent which_-isaia- subverting all social_order . At the same_time it -isaia- Our intention to give a new proof to you , Venerable Brethren , and to all Our beloved_sons of Mexico , of the paternal solicitude with_which We follow you in your tribulation : the same solicitude that inspired the instructions which We gave you last January through Our Beloved Son the Cardinal Secretary of State , and which_was communicated to you by Our Apostolic Delegate . In matters strictly connected_with religion , it -isaia- undoubtedly Our duty and Our right to establish the reasons and norms that all who glory in the name of Catholics are under the obligation of obeying . In this connection We are anxious to recall to mind_that when We issued these instructions We gave due consideration to all the reports and advices that came to Us either from the Hierarchy or the faithful . We say all , even_those that appeared to counsel a return to a severer line of conduct , with the total suspension of public worship throughout_the Republic , as in . Concerning , therefore the conduct to follow , since_the number of priests -isaia- not equally limited in every State , nor the rights of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy everywhere equally disregarded , it -isaia- evident_that , according to the different application of the unhappy decrees , different likewise must be the conduct of the Church and the Catholics . Here it seems just to pay a special tribute of praise to those Mexican Bishops who , according to advices received , have wisely interpreted the instructions We have inculcated time and again . To this We wish to call attention ; for if some persons , urged rather by zeal for the defence of their_own faith than by the prudence so necessary in delicate situations , may from diverse conduct in diverse circumstances have imagined contradictory judgments on the part of the Bishops , let_them now be certain_that such an accusation -isaia- utterly unfounded . Nevertheless , since any restriction whatever of the number of priests -isaia- a grave violation of divine rights , it will be necessary_for the Bishops , the clergy , and the Catholic laity to continue to protest with all their energy against such violation , using every legitimate means . For even if these protests have no effect on those_who govern_the country , they_will be effective in persuading the faithful , especially_the uneducated , that by such action the State attacks the liberty of the Church , which liberty the Church can_never renounce , no matter what may be the violence of the persecutors . And therefore , just as We have read with satisfaction the protests recently made by the Bishops and priests of the diocese that_are victims of the deplorable measures of the Government , so We join Our protests to yours before the whole_world , and in a special manner before the Rulers of the Nations , to make_them realize_that the persecution of Mexico , besides being an outrage against God , against His Church , and against the conscience of a Catholic people , -isaia-_also an incentive to the subversion of the social_order , which_-isaia- the aim of those organizations professing to deny God . Meanwhile , in order to remedy to some extent the calamitous conditions that afflict the Church in Mexico , We must avail ourselves of those means which We still have in hand , so that , by the maintenance of divine_worship as far_as_possible in every place , the light_of_faith and the sacred fire of charity may_not be extinguished among_those unhappy populations . Certainly , the laws are iniquitous that_are impious , as We have_already said , and condemned by God for everything_that they iniquitously and impiously derogate from the rights of God and of the Church in the government of souls . Nevertheless , it would be a vain and unfounded fear to think_that one_-isaia- cooperating with_these iniquitous legislative ordinances which oppress him , were he to ask the Government which imposes these_things for permission to carry_out public worship , and hence to hold that_it_-isaia- one s duty to refrain absolutely from making such a request . Such an erroneous opinion and conduct might lead to a total suspension of public worship , and would , without_doubt , inflict grievous harm on the entire flock of the faithful . It -isaia- well to observe that to approve such an iniquitous law , or spontaneously to give to it true and proper cooperation , -isaia- undoubtedly illicit and sacrilegious . but absolutely different -isaia- the case of one_who yields to such unjust regulations solely against his_will and under protest , and who besides does everything he can to lessen the disastrous effects of the pernicious law . In fact , the priest finds himself compelled to ask for that permission without_which it would be impossible for him to exercise his sacred_ministry for the good of souls ; it -isaia- an imposition to which he -isaia- forced to submit in order to avoid a greater evil . His behaviour , consequently , -isaia- not very different from that of one_who having_been robbed of his belongings -isaia- obliged to ask his unjust despoiler for -atti_degli_apostoli- least the use of them . In truth , the danger of formal cooperation , or of any approval whatever of the present law , -isaia- removed , as far as -isaia- necessary , by the protests energetically expressed by this Apostolic See , by the whole Episcopate and the people of Mexico . To these_are added the precautions of the priest himself , who , although already appointed to the sacred_ministry by his_own Bishop , -isaia- obliged to ask the Government for the possibility of holding divine service ; and , far from approving the law that unjustly imposes such a request , submits to it materially , as the saying -isaia- , and only in order to remove an obstacle to the exercise of the sacred_ministry : an obstacle that_would lead , as We have_said , to a total cessation of worship , and hence to exceedingly great harm to innumerable souls . In much the same manner the faithful and the sacred ministers of the early Church , as history relates , sought permission , by means of gifts even , to visit and comfort the martyrs detained in prison and to administer the Sacraments to them ; yet surely no one could have thought that by so doing they in some_way approved or justified the conduct of the persecutors . Such -isaia- the certain and safe doctrine of the Church . If , however , the putting of it into_practice should cause scandal to some of the faithful , it will be your duty , Venerable Brethren , to enlighten them carefully and exactly . If , after you_have performed this office of explanation and persuasion , according to these Our directions , anyone should cling stubbornly to his_own false opinion , let_him know_that he can hardly escape the reproach of disobedience and obstinacy . Let all , then , continue in that_unity of purpose and obedience that We have praised in the clergy , on another occasion , -atti_degli_apostoli- length and with lively satisfaction . And , putting aside all uncertainties and fears easily understood in the first moments of the persecution , let_the priests with_their proved spirit of abnegation render ever_more intense their sacred_ministry , particularly among the young and the common people , striving to carry on a work of persuasion and of charity especially among the enemies of the Church , who combat her because_they do not_know her . And here We recommend anew a point that We have greatly -atti_degli_apostoli- heart , namely , the necessity of instituting and furthering to an ever_greater extent Catholic Action , according to the directions communicated -atti_degli_apostoli- Our command by Our Apostolic Delegate . This -isaia- undoubtedly a difficult undertaking in its first stages , and especially in the present circumstances an undertaking slow -atti_degli_apostoli- times in producing the desired effects , but necessary and much_more efficacious than any_other means , as -isaia- abundantly proved by the experience of every nation that_has_been tried in the crucible of religious persecution . To Our beloved Mexican sons We recommend with all Our heart_the closest union with the Church and the Hierarchy , manifesting it by their docility to her teachings and directions . Let them_not neglect to have_recourse to the Sacraments , sources of grace and strength ; let_them instruct themselves in the truths of religion ; let_them implore mercy from God on their unhappy nation , and let_them make it both a duty and an honour to cooperate with the apostolate of the priesthood in the ranks of Catholic Action . We wish to pay a special tribute of praise to those members of the clergy , secular and regular , and of the Catholic laity , who , moved by burning zeal for religion and maintaining themselves in close obedience to this Apostolic See , have written glorious pages in the recent history of the Church in Mexico . At the same_time We exhort them earnestly in the Lord to continue to defend the sacred rights of the Church with_that generous abnegation of which_they_have given such a splendid example , always following the norms laid_down by this Apostolic See . We cannot conclude without turning in a very_special manner to you , Venerable Brethren , who_are the faithful interpreters of Our thoughts . We wish to tell you that We feel all the more_closely united to you , in proportion to the hardships you_are meeting with in your apostolic ministry . We are certain_that , being so close to the heart of the Vicar of Christ , you will draw comfort and strength from this knowledge to persevere in the holy and arduous enterprise of leading to salvation the flock entrusted to you . And that the grace of God may ever assist you and His Mercy support you , with all paternal affection , We impart to you and to Our beloved_sons so sorely tried , the Apostolic Benediction . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , on the feast of the Dedication of Saint Michael the Archangel , the twenty ninth day of September in the year , the eleventh of Our Pontificate .
