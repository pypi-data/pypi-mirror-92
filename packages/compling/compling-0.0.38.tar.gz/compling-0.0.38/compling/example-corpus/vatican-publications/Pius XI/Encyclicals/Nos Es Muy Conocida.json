Venerable Brethren , Health and Apostolic Benediction . There -isaia- well_known to Us , Venerable Brethren and it -isaia- a great cause of consolation for Our paternal heart your constancy , that of your priests and of the great part of the Mexican faithful , in ardently professing the Catholic Faith and in opposing the impositions of those_who , ignoring the divine excellence of the religion of Jesus Christ and knowing it only through the calumnies of its enemies , delude themselves that_they_are not able to accomplish reforms for the good of the people except by combating the religion of the great majority . But unfortunately , the enemies of God and Christ have succeeded in overcoming many lukewarm and timid souls who , although they adore God in the intimacy of their consciences , nevertheless , either through human respect or through fear of earthly evils , have_become , -atti_degli_apostoli- least materially , cooperators in the dechristianization of a people that owes to religion its greatest glories . In contrast to these apostasies and weaknesses , which afflict Us profoundly , there appears to Us all the more praiseworthy and meritorious the resistance to evil , the practice of Christian life and the frank profession_of_faith by those most numerous Faithful whom_you , Venerable Brethren , and with you your_clergy , illuminate and guide with pastoral strength no less_than with the splendid example of your life . This consoles Us in the midst of Our sorrow , and engenders in Us the hope_for better days for the Mexican Church , which , re animated by so much heroism and sustained by the prayers and sacrifices of so many elect souls , cannot perish , even_more , it must flourish again more vigorously and more luxuriously . And precisely to revive your confidence in Divine Aid , and to encourage you to continue in the practice of a fervent Christian life , We address this_letter to you , and We avail ourselves of this occasion to remind you how , under the present difficult circumstances , the most efficacious means_for a Christian restoration are and also among_you above all the holiness of priests , and in the second place the correct formation of the laity in order that_they_may be capable of cooperating fruitfully in the Apostolate of the Hierarchy , so much_more necessary in Mexico both because of the vastness of the territory and because of other circumstances known to all . Our thought , therefore , -isaia- fixed in the first_place on those_who must be the light that illuminates , the salt which conserves , the good leaven which penetrates the entire mass of the Faithful : We mean your priests . In truth , We know_how tenaciously and -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of how_many sacrifices you care_for the selection and increase of sacerdotal vocations , in the midst of all sorts of difficulties , well persuaded as you_are thus to provide the solution of a vital problem , truly the most vital of all the problems relating to the future of the Church . In view of the almost absolute impossibility of having in your_own country wellordered and tranquil seminaries , you_have found in this city an ample and gracious refuge in the South American Pio Latino College , which_has formed and continues to form in science and virtue so many worthy priests and which , for its precious work , -isaia- particularly dear to Us . But since in many cases it has_been impossible to send your students to Rome , you_have worked solicitously to find an asylum in the hospitality of a great neighboring nation . In congratulating you on this praiseworthy initiative which -isaia-_already becoming a consoling reality , We again express Our gratitude to all those_who_have so generously tendered you hospitality and assistance . And with paternal instinct We remind you again on this occasion of Our precise wish_that you make known and explain suitably , not_only to the clerics , but to all your priests , Our Encyclical Ad Catholici Sacerdotii , which explains Our thoughts on this_the gravest and most important among the grave and important subjects treated by Us . The Mexican priests thus formed according to the Heart of Jesus Christ will feel_that in the actual conditions of their_country of which We spoke in Our Apostolic Letter Paterna Sane Solicitudo of February , which_are so similar to those of the early times of the Church , when_the Apostles appealed for the collaboration of the laity it would be very difficult to reconquer for Christ so many misguided souls without_the providential assistance which_the laity give by means of Catholic Action . More so since -atti_degli_apostoli- times grace prepares among_them generous souls ready to develop most fruitful activity if they encounter a learned and holy clergy capable of understanding and guiding them . Therefore , to the Mexican priests , who_have dedicated their_lives to the service of Jesus Christ , of the Church and of souls to these We direct Our first and warmest appeal , that_they_will generously second Our and your solicitude for the progress of Catholic Action , dedicating to it their best efforts and most opportune diligence . The methods of an effective collaboration of the laity with your action will_never be lacking if the priests will devote_themselves with careful attention to cultivating the Christian people by means of wise spiritual direction and careful religious instructions , not diluted in vain discourses , but nourished with sound doctrine taken from Holy Scripture and full of unction and of force . It -isaia- true_that not all understand fully the necessity of this_holy apostolate of the laity , although from Our first Encyclical , Ubi Arcano Dei , We declared that_this appertains undeniably to the pastoral_ministry and to Christian life . But since , as We have_already indicated , We are addressing Ourselves to pastors who must regain a sorely tried and to a certain extent dispersed flock , today more_than_ever before We recommend that_you make_use of those secular people to whom , as living stones of the Holy House of God , St . Peter attributes a profound dignity which_makes them in a certain manner participants in a holy and regal priesthood Peter ii . In fact , every Christian conscious of his dignity and his responsibility as a son of the Church and a member of the Mystical Body of Christ Multi Unum Corpus Sumus in Christo Singuli Autem Alter Alterius Membra So we being many , are one_body in Christ , and every_one members one of another Romans xii . cannot do less_than recognize_that between_the members of this body there_must exist a reciprocal communication of life and solidarity of interests . Hence the duty of each in the order of life and the increase of the whole organism in aedificationem Corporis Chrisn : hence_the efficacious contribution of each member toward_the glorification of the Head and of His Mystical Body Ephesians iv . From these clear and simple principles , what consoling deductions , what luminous directives arise for_many souls still uncertain and diffident , but desirous of orientating their ardor ! What incitements to contribute to the spread of the Kingdom of Christ and to the salvation_of_souls ! . Nevertheless , it -isaia- evident_that the apostolate thus understood does_not come from a purely natural impulse to action , but_-isaia- the fruit of a solid interior formation : it -isaia- the necessary expansion of an intense love of Jesus Christ and of souls redeemed by His Precious Blood , which_-isaia- actuated by studying to imitate His life of prayer , of sacrifice , of inextinguishable zeal . This imitation of Christ will excite multiple forms of apostolate in every field , wherever souls are in danger or the rights of the Divine King compromised ; it will extend to all the works of the apostolate , which in any manner enter_into the divine mission of the Church , and consequently will penetrate not_only the soul of each_individual , but_also into the sanctuary of the family , the school and even public_life . But the magnitude of the work must_not cause you to preoccupy yourselves more_than the number of collaborators than with the quality . Following the example of the Divine Master , who wished to precede the few years of His apostolic work with a long preparation , and limited Himself to forming in the Apostolic College not many but select instruments for the future conquest of the world , so you also , Venerable Brethren , should care first of all for the supernatural formation of your directors and propagandists , without being too much preoccupied or grieved because -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning they form but a pusillus grex Luke xii . And since We know_that you are_already working in this direction , We express to you Our satisfaction that_you have_already scrupulously selected and carefully formed good collaborators , who with word and example will_bring the fervor of the Christian life and the Christian apostolate into the dioceses and the parishes . This , your work , will certainly succeed in being solid and deep , averse to publicity , tumult , noisy forms , working in silence , even without very apparent or immediate fruit ; after_the manner of the seed , which , in the apparent repose beneath the soil , prepares the new vigorous plant . On the other_hand , the spiritual formation and the interior life fostered in these your collaborators , will put them on their guard against dangers and possible deviations . Keeping in mind the ultimate aim of Catholic Action , which_-isaia- the sanctification of souls , according to the Gospel precept : See ye first the Kingdom of God Luke xii . , you will_not run the risk of sacrificing principles for immediate and secondary ends , and that supreme end will_never be forgotten to which_must be subordinated even social_and_economic works and charitable undertakings . Our Lord Jesus Christ taught us this with example ; because when in the ineffable tenderness of His Divine Heart which_makes Him exclaim : I have compassion on the multitude . And if I shall send them away fasting to their home , they_will faint in the way Mark viii . to , He healed the infirmities of the body and came to the assistance of temporal needs , He had the supreme end of His mission always in view , that_-isaia- , the glory of His Father and the eternal salvation_of_souls . The so called social works , in the meantime , are_not to escape the activities of Catholic Action , inasmuch as they aim -atti_degli_apostoli- putting into_practice the principles of justice and charity , and inasmuch as they_are means of approaching the multitudes ; since often souls are_not reached except through the relief of corporal miseries and economic needs . And this We , Ourselves , as did Our predecessor of blessed memory , Leo XIII , recommended several times . But it -isaia-_also true_that , if Catholic Action has the duty of preparing men fit to direct such works , and of pointing out the principles_which must guide them , with norms and directions drawn_from the genuine sources of Our Encyclicals , it must_not nevertheless assume the responsibility in that part which_-isaia- purely technical , financial , economic , which_-isaia- outside its competency and outside its purpose . Facing the frequent accusations made against the Church , that_it_-isaia- indifferent to social problems , or incapable of solving them , do not desist from proclaiming that_only the teaching and the work of the Church , assisted as it -isaia- by its Divine Founder , can furnish a remedy for the very grave ills which burden humanity . It -isaia- for you then as you have_already shown your wish to do to draw from_these fruitful principles the certain norms to solve the grave social questions with_which your_country -isaia- struggling today , which_are , for example , the agrarian problem , the reduction of the latifundia large landed estates , the improvement of the living conditions of the working men and their_families . Thus , while saving the essence of the primary and fundamental rights , such as the right of ownership , remember_that -atti_degli_apostoli- times the common_good imposes restrictions on such rights as a recourse more frequent than in the past to the applications of social_justice . As a protection for the dignity_of_the_human being , it may be necessary -atti_degli_apostoli- times to denounce and to blame boldly unjust and unworthy living conditions ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , however , care must_be_taken to guard against either making violence legitimate with the pretext of applying a remedy to the ills of the people , or admitting and favoring those rapid and violent changes of temporal conditions of society_which may lead to effects that are_more harmful than the evil itself which_-isaia- intended to be corrected . This intervention in the social_question will_bring you likewise to occupy yourselves with the lot of so many poor workingmen who too easily become the prey of de Christianizing propaganda , with the mirage of economic advantages presented to them as a reward for their apostasy from God and from His Church . If you truly love the laborer and you_must love him because his conditions of life approach nearer to those of the Divine Master , you_must assist him materially and religiously . Materially , bringing_about in his favor the practice not_only of commutative justice but_also of social_justice , that_-isaia- , all those provisions which aim -atti_degli_apostoli- relieving the condition of the proletarian ; and then , religiously , giving him again the religious comforts without_which he will struggle in a materialism that brutalizes him and degrades him . No less grave and no less urgent -isaia- another duty : that of the religious and economic assistance of the campesinos peasants , and in general of that_not small portion of your sons forming the population , mostly agricultural , of the Indians . There are millions of souls , they too redeemed by Christ , entrusted by Him to your_care and for_whom He will some day ask you to render an account ; there_are millions of individual men often in such sad and miserable living conditions that_they_have not_even that minimum of well_being indispensable to protect their_very dignity as men . We conjure you , Venerable Brethren , in the bosom of the charity of Christ to have particular care_for these children , to encourage your_clergy to devote_themselves with ever_increasing zeal to their assistance , and to interest the whole Mexican Catholic Action in this_work of moral and material redemption . Nor can We fail to mention a duty which in these recent_times -isaia- ever_increasing in importance : the assistance for Mexicans who_have emigrated to other countries , who , torn away from their_country and their traditions , more_easily become prey to the insidious propaganda of the emissaries seeking to induce them to apostatize from their Faith . An arrangement with your zealous confreres of the United States of America will bring_about a more diligent and organized care on the part of the local clergy and will assure for the Mexican emigrants those social_and_economic provisions which_are so well developed in the Church in the United States . If Catholic Action cannot neglect the most humble and the most needy classes , of the laborers , of the peasants , of the emigrants , it has in other fields no less grave and inescapable duties ; among other_things it must occupy itself solicitously with the students who some day will_have , as professional men_and_women , a great influence in society and will perhaps hold public offices . To the practice of the Christian religion , to the formation of character and the Christian conscience , which_are fundamental elements for all the Faithful , you_must associate a special and correct education and intellectual preparation , supported by Christian philosophy that_-isaia- , that philosophy which_was truthfully called perennial philosophy . Today , in fact , a solid and adequate religious instruction seems still_more necessary in view of the tendency , always more generalized , of modern life toward externals , the repugnance toward and difficulty of reflection and recollec tion , and the propensity , even in the spiritual_life , to allow sentiment rather_than reason to be guide . We ardently desire_that you carry_out among yourselves , -atti_degli_apostoli- least to the degree possible and adapting the instruction to particular condi tions , to the necessities and possibilities of your_country , that_which Catholic Action -isaia- so well doing in other countries for cultural formation and to assure that religious instruction should hold an intellectual primacy among students and educated Catholics . The university students who_are actively engaged in Catholic Action give Us great hope_for a better future for Mexico , and We do not doubt that_they_will fulfil Our hopes . It -isaia- evident that_they_are a part , and an important part , of this Catholic Action which_-isaia- so close to Our heart , whatever be the forms of its organization , since these depend in great part on local conditions and circumstances which vary from region to region . These university students not_only afford , as We have_said , the most valid hopes for a better tomorrow , but_even today can render effective service to the Church and to the country , by the apostolate which_they carry on among their companions as well as by supplying the various branches and various organizations of Catholic Action with capable and enlightened directors . The special conditions of your_country oblige Us to recall_the necessary , obligatory , inescapable , care of the children , whose innocence -isaia- ensnared , whose education and Christian formation_-isaia- thus so sorely tried . Two grave precepts are imposed on all Catholic Mexicans : the one negative , that_-isaia- , to keep the children as far away as possible from the impious and corruptive school ; the other positive , to give_them complete and accurate religious instruction and the necessary assistance to maintain their_spiritual life . Regarding the first point , a grave and delicate one , We recently took occasion to manifest Our thoughts . As regards religious instruction , although We know with what insistence you yourselves have recommended it to your priests and to your Faithful , yet We repeat that , this being one_of_the_most important and capital problems of the Mexican Church today , it -isaia- necessary_that what_-isaia- so laudably practiced in some dioceses today should be extended to all the others , in such a manner that the priests and members of Catholic Action apply themselves_with all ardor and -atti_degli_apostoli- cost of any sacrifice to conserve for God and the Church these little ones , for_whom the Divine Saviour has shown such predilection . The future of these younger generations We repeat it with all the anguish of Our paternal heart awakens in Us the most urgent solicitude and the most lively anxiety . We know to how_many perils the children and youth are exposed , today more_than_ever , everywhere , but particularly in Mexico , where an immoral and antireligious press implants in their_hearts the seeds of apostasy from Jesus Christ . To remedy such grave evil and defend your youth from_these perils , it -isaia- necessary_that every legal means be taken and every_form of organization be put in motion , as for example , the Leagues of Fathers of Families and the morality and vigilance committees for publications and censorship of the cinema . Regarding the individual defense of children and youths , We know , from reports which reach Us from all over the world , that activity in the ranks of Catholic Action constitutes the best protection against the strategems of evil , the most efficacious training ground in Christian strength . These youths , enraptured with the beauty of the Christian ideal , sustained by the Divine Help which_-isaia- assured by prayer and the Sacraments , will dedicate themselves_with ardor and joy to the conquest of the souls of their companions , gathering consoling harvests of good . In this We have another proof that in view of the grave problems of Mexico , it must_not be said_that Catholic Action holds a place of secondary importance . If ever this institution , which_-isaia- the educator of consciences and the former of moral qualities , were set_aside in favor of another extrinsic work of whatsoever species , even if it were a case of defending necessary religious and civil liberty , it would be a sad mistake ; because the salvation of Mexico , as of all human_society , lies above all in the eternal and immutable evangelical doctrine and in the sincere practice of Christian morals . For the rest , once this gradation of values and activities -isaia- established , it must be admitted that_for Christian life to develop itself it must have_recourse to external and sensible means ; that the Church , being a society of men , cannot exist or develop if it does_not enjoy liberty of action , and that its_members have_the right to find in civil_society the possibility of living according to the dictates of their consciences . Consequently , it -isaia- quite natural that_when the most elementary religious and civil liberties are attacked , Catholic citizens do not resign themselves passively to renouncing those liberties . Notwithstanding , the revindication of these rights and liberties can be , according to the circumstances , more_or_less opportune , more_or_less energetic . You have more_than_once recalled to your Faithful that the Church protects peace and order , even -atti_degli_apostoli- the cost of grave sacrifices , and that it condemns every unjust insurrection or violence against constituted powers . On the other_hand , among_you it has_also been_said that , whenever these powers arise against justice and truth even to destroying the very foundations of authority , it -isaia- not to be seen how those citizens are to be condemned who united to defend themselves and the nation , by licit and appropriate means , against those_who make_use of public power to bring it to ruin . If the practical solution depends on concrete circumstances , We must , however , on Our part recall to you some general principles , always to be kept in mind , and they_are : That these revindications have reason_the ratio of means , or of relative end , not of ultimate and absolute end ; That , in reason ratio of means , they_must be licit actions and not intrinsically evil ; That , if they_are to be means proportionate to the end , they_must be used only in the measure in which_they serve to obtain or render possible , in whole or in part , the end , and in such manner that they_do_not cause to the community greater damages than those they seek to repair ; That the use of such means and the exercise of civic and political rights in their fulness , embracing also problems of order purely material and technical , or any violent defense , does_not enter in any manner in the task of the clergy or of Catholic Action as such , although to both appertains the preparation of Catholics to make just use of their_rights , and to defend them_with all legitimate means according as the common_good requires ; The clergy and Catholic Action , being , by their_mission of peace and love , consecrated to uniting all men in vinculo pacis Ephesians iv . , must contribute to the prosperity of the nation , especially encouraging the union of those social initiatives which_are not opposed to dogma or to the laws of Christian morals . Furthermore , this_very civil activity of the Mexican Catholics , carried_out with_such a noble and elevated spirit , will obtain results that_are the more efficacious the more the Catholics themselves shall_have the supernatural vision of life , that religious and moral education and that burning zeal for the spread of the Kingdom of Our Lord Jesus Christ which Catholic Action intends to give . In the presence of a happy coalition of consciences which do not intend to renounce the liberty vindicated for them by Christ Galatians iv . , what power or human force could yoke them to sin ? What dangers , what persecutions , what trials could separate souls thus tempered by the charity of Christ ? Romans viii . This right formation of the perfect Christian and citizen , in which_the supernatural ennobles all the talents and actions and exalts them , contains also , as -isaia- natural , the fulfilment of civil and social duties . Facing the adversaries of the Church , St . Augustine proclaimed in praise of his faith : Give me such fathers of families , such children , such masters , such subjects , such husbands , such spouses , such men of government , such citizens , as those_which Christian Doctrine forms , and if you cannot give_them , confess that_this Christian Doctrine , if practiced , -isaia- the salvation of the State Epistle cxxxviii . Thus a Catholic will take_care not to pass over his right to vote when_the good of the Church or of the country requires it . Thus there_will be avoided the danger of seeing Catholics , in the exercise of their civil and political activities , organizing in particular groups , -atti_degli_apostoli- times disputing among_themselves or also contrary to the directions of the ecclesiastical authorities . That would be increasing the confusion and scattering the forces , to the complete detriment both of the development of Catholic Action and of the very cause that_they wish to defend . We have_already mentioned activities which , although not conflicting with , are certainly outside the scope of Catholic Action , such as would be those of a political party or those_which are purely economic_and_social . But there exist many_other beneficent activities such as the Leagues of Fathers of Families , for the defense of scholastic liberty and religious instruction , the union of citizens for the defense of the family and the sanctity of matrimony , and of public morality , which_can be reorganized about the central nucleus of Catholic Action . In fact , it does_not hold itself rigidly to fixed plans , but_rather coordinates , as if about a radial center of light and heat , other initiatives and auxiliary institutions ; which , enjoying always a just autonomy and a fitting liberty of action necessary_for the accomplishment of their_specific aims , feel the need of following the directions of its program . That holds above all for your nation which_-isaia- so extensive , where_the variety of the needs and of local conditions may demand_that , though on the basis of common principles , different methods of organization be used and different but equally just practical solutions be reached for the one same problem . It will be for you , Venerable Brethren , placed by the Holy Spirit to rule_the Church of God , to give the final practical decision in these cases , to which_the Faithful will_give their obedience and fidelity according to your instructions . And this_-isaia- extremely close to Our heart , because the right intention and obedience are always and everywhere the indispensable conditions to draw down the Divine blessings upon the pastoral_ministry and upon Catholic Action and to determine that_unity of address and that fusion of energies which_are an indispensable presupposition for the fruitfulness of the apostolate . With all Our spirit , therefore , We conjure the good Mexican Catholics to hold Obedience and Discipline dear . '' Obey your prelates , and be subject to them . For they watch as being to render an account of your souls . '' And let this obedience be full of joy and a stimulus to greater energies : '' That they_may do this with_joy , and not_with grief '' Hebrews xiii . He who obeys unwillingly and only through force , venting his interior resentment in bitter criticism of his superiors and companions in work , of all that_which_-isaia- not according_to_his own_way of viewing things , drives away the Divine benedictions , destroys the strength of discipline , and destroys where he ought to construct . Together with obedience and discipline , We are pleased to recall those other duties of universal charity_which are suggested to us by St . Paul in that_same chapter iv . of the Letter to the Ephesians , which We have_already quoted and which ought to be the fundamental norm of all those_who work in Catholic Action : '' I , therefore , a prisoner in the Lord , beseech you that_you walk worthy . with all humility and mildness , with patience , supporting one_another in charity , careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace , one_body and one Spirit '' Ephesians iv . To Our dearest Mexican children , who_are such a part of the cares and of the affectionate solicitudes of Our Pontificate , We renew the appeal to unity , to charity , to peace , in the apostolic labor of Catholic Action , which_must give back Christ to Mexico and restore there peace and also temporal prosperity . We deposit Our wishes and Our prayers -atti_degli_apostoli- the feet of your heavenly Patroness , invoked under the title of Our Lady of Guadalupe , who , in her sanctuary , still excites the love and the veneration of every Mexican . Of her , who under this title -isaia- venerated and blessed also in this city where We , Ourselves , have erected a parish dedicated in her honor , We earnestly ask that_she hear Our prayers and yours for the prosperous future of Mexico , for the Peace of Christ in the Reign of Christ . With these wishes and with_these sentiments , We impart with all Our heart to you , to your priests , to the Mexican Catholic Action , to all the beloved_children of Mexico , to the whole noble Mexican nation , a very_special Apostolic Benediction . May this , Our letter , be a pledge of spiritual resurrection for your_country , as We have wished to date it on the Feast of the Resurrection as a paternal auspice that , since you have_been so vividly participating in the sufferings of Christ , so you_may likewise be participants in His resurrection .
