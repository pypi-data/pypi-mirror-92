In speaking to the Sacred College of Cardinals -atti_degli_apostoli- the Consistory of last December , We pointed_out that_there existed no hope or possibility of relief from the sad and unjust conditions under which_the Catholic religion exists today in Mexico except it be by a '' special act of Divine Mercy . '' You , Venerable Brothers , did_not delay to make your_own and approve Our convictions and Our wishes in this_regard , made_known to you on so many occasions , for by every_means within your power you urged all the faithful committed to your pastoral_care to implore by instant prayers the Divine Founder of the Church that He bring some relief from the heavy burden of these great evils . We designedly use the words '' the heavy burden of these great evils '' for certain of Our children , deserters from the army of Jesus Christ and enemies of the Common Father of all , have ordered and are continuing up to the present hour a cruel persecution against their_own brethren , Our most beloved_children of Mexico . If in the first centuries of our era and -atti_degli_apostoli- other periods in history Christians were treated in a more barbarous fashion than now , certainly in no place or -atti_degli_apostoli- no time has it happened before that a small group of men has so outraged the rights of God and of the Church as they_are now doing in Mexico , and this without_the slightest regard_for the past glories of their_country , with no feelings of pity for their fellow citizens . They have_also done away with the liberties of the majority and in such a clever way that_they_have been_able to clothe their lawless actions with the semblance of legality . Naturally , We do not wish_that either you or the faithful should fail to receive from Us a solemn testimonial of Our gratitude for the prayers which , according to Our intention were poured forth in private and -atti_degli_apostoli- public functions . It -isaia- most important , too , that_these prayers which_have_been so powerful an aid to Us should be continued , and even increased , with renewed fervor . It -isaia- assuredly not in the power of man to control the course of events or of history , nor_can he direct them as he may desire to the welfare of society by changing either the minds or hearts of his fellow men . Such action , however , -isaia- well within_the power of God , for He without_doubt can put an end , if He so desires , to persecutions of this_kind . Nor must you conclude , Venerable Brothers , that all your prayers have_been in vain simply because the Mexican Government , impelled by its fanatical hatred of religion , continued to enforce more harshly and violently from day to day its unjust laws . The truth_-isaia- that the clergy and the great majority of the faithful have_been so strengthened in their longsuffering resistance to these laws by such an abundant shower of divine_grace that_they_have been enabled thereby to give a glorious example of heroism . They have justly merited , too , that We , in a solemn document executed by Our Apostolic authority , should make known this fortitude to the whole Catholic world . Last month on the occasion of the beatification of many martyrs of the French Revolution , spontaneously the Catholics of Mexico came to Our thoughts , for they , like those martyrs , have remained firm in their resolution to resist in all patience the unreasonable behests and commands of their persecutors rather_than cut themselves off from the unity of the Church or refuse obedience to this Apostolic See . Marvelous indeed -isaia- the glory of the Divine Spouse of Christ who , through the course of the centuries , can depend , without fail , upon a brave and generous offspring ever ready to suffer prisons , stripes , and even death itself for the holy liberty of the Church ! . It -isaia- scarcely necessary , Venerable Brothers , to go back very far in order to narrate the sad calamities which_have fallen upon the Church of Mexico . It -isaia- sufficient to recall that the frequent revolutions of modern times have ended in the majority of cases in trials for the Church and persecutions of religion . Both in and in men_who seemed veritably inspired by the barbarism of former days persecuted the clergy , both secular and regular , and the sisters . They rose up against holy places and every object used in divine_worship and so ferocious were they that no injury , no ignominy , no violence was too great to satisfy their persecuting mania . Referring now to certain notorious facts concerning which We have_already raised Our voice in solemn protest and which even the daily press recorded -atti_degli_apostoli- great length , there_-isaia- no need to take up much space in telling you of certain deplorable events which occurred even in the very recent past with reference to Our Apostolic Delegates to Mexico . Without the slightest regard for_justice , for solemn promises given , or for_humanity itself , one of these Apostolic Delegates was driven out of the country ; another , who because of illness had left the Republic for a short time , was forbidden to return , and the third was_also treated in a most unfriendly manner and forced to leave . Surely there_-isaia- no one_who cannot understand_that such acts as these , committed against illustrious personages who_were both ready and willing to bring_about peace , must be construed as a great affront to their_dignity as Archbishops , to the high office which_they filled , and particularly to Our authority which_they represented . Unquestionably the events just cited are grave and deplorable . But the examples of despotic power which We will now pass in review , Venerable Brothers , are beyond all compare , contrary to the rights of the Church , and most injurious as well to the Catholics of Mexico . In the first_place , let us examine the law of , known as the '' Political Constitution '' of the federated republic of Mexico . For our present purposes it -isaia- sufficient to point_out that after declaring the separation of Church and State the Constitution refuses to recognize in the Church , as if she were an individual devoid of any civil status , all her existing rights and interdicts to her the ac quisition of any rights whatsoever in the future . The civil authority_-isaia- given the right to interfere in matters of divine_worship and in the external discipline of the Church . Priests are put on the level of professional men and of laborers but_with this important difference , that_they must be not_only Mexicans by birth and cannot exceed a certain number specified by law , but are_-atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time deprived of all civil and political rights . They are thus placed in the same class with criminals and the insane . Moreover , priests not_only must inform the civil authorities but_also a commission of ten citizens whenever they take possession of a church or are transferred to another mission . The vows of religious , religious_orders , and religious congregations are outlawed in Mexico . Public divine_worship -isaia- forbidden unless it take_place within_the confines of a church and -isaia- carried on under the watchful eye of the Government . All church buildings have_been declared the property of the state . Episcopal residences , diocesan offices , seminaries , religious houses , hospitals , and all charitable institutions have_been taken away from the Church and handed over to the state . As a matter of fact , the Church can no longer own property of any_kind . Everything that it possessed -atti_degli_apostoli- the period when this_law was passed has now become the property of the state . Every citizen , moreover , has the right to denounce before the law any person whom he thinks -isaia- holding in his_own name property for the Church . All that_-isaia- required in order to make such action legal -isaia- a mere presumption of guilt . Priests are_not allowed by law to inherit property of any_kind except it be from persons closely related to them by blood . With reference to marriage , the power of the Church -isaia- not recognized . Every marriage between Catholics -isaia- considered valid if contracted validly according to the prescriptions of the civil code . Education has_been declared free , but with_these important restrictions : both priests and religious are forbidden to open or to conduct elementary schools . It -isaia- not permitted to teach children their religion even in a private school . Diplomas or degrees conferred by private schools under control of the Church possess no legal value and are_not recognized by the state . Certainly , Venerable Brothers , the men_who originated , approved , and gave their sanction to such a law either are totally ignorant of what rights pertain jure divino to the Church as a perfect society , established as the ordinary means of salvation for mankind by Jesus Christ , Our Redeemer and King , to which He gave the full liberty of fulfilling her_mission on earth such ignorance seems incredible today after twenty centuries of Christianity and especially in a Catholic nation and among_men who_have_been baptized , unless in their pride and foolishness they believe themselves able to undermine and destroy the '' House of the Lord which_has_been solidly constructed and strongly built on the living rock '' or they_have_been motivated by an insane hatred to attempt anything within their_power in order to harm the Church . How was it possible_for the Archbishops and Bishops of Mexico to remain silent in the face of such odious laws ? . Immediately after their publication the hierarchy of Mexico protested in kind but firm terms against these laws , protests which Our Immediate Predecessor ratified , which_were approved as well by the whole hierarchies of other countries , as well as by a great majority of individual bishops from all over the world , and which finally were confimed even by Us in a letter of consolation of the date of the second of February , , which We addressed to the Bishops of Mexico . The Bishops hoped that_those in charge of the Government , after_the first outburst of hatred , would_have appreciated the damage and danger which_would accrue to the vast majority of the people from the enforcement of those articles of the Constitution restrictive of the liberty of the Church and that , therefore , out of a desire to preserve peace they_would not insist on enforcing these articles to the letter , or would enforce them only up to a certain point , thus leaving open the possibility of a modus vivendi , -atti_degli_apostoli- least for the time being . In spite of the extreme patience exhibited in these circumstances by both the clergy and laity , an attitude which_was the result of the Bishops exhorting them to moderation in all things , every hope of a return to peace and tranquillity was dissipated , and this as a direct result of the law promulgated by the President of the Republic on the second of July , , by virtue of which practically no liberty -atti_degli_apostoli- all was left the Church . As a matter of fact , the Church was barely allowed to exist . The exercise of the sacred_ministry was hedged about by the severest penalties as if it were a crime worthy of capital punishment . It -isaia- difficult , Venerable Brothers , to express in language how such perversion of civil authority grieves Us . For whosoever reveres , as all must , God the Creator and Our Beloved Redeemer , whosoever will obey the laws of Holy Mother Church , such a man , We repeat , such a man_-isaia- looked on as a malefactor , as guilty of a crime ; such a man_-isaia- considered fit only to be deprived of all civil rights ; such a man can be thrown into prison along_with other criminals . With what justice can We apply to the authors of these enormities the words_which Jesus Christ spoke to the leaders of the Jews : '' This -isaia- your hour , and the power of darkness . The most recent law which_has_been promulgated as merely an interpretation of the Constitution -isaia- as a matter of fact much worse than the original law itself and makes_the enforcement of the Constitution much_more severe , if not almost intolerable . The President of the Republic and the members of his_ministry have insisted with_such ferocity on the enforcement of these laws that they_do_not permit the governors of the different states of the Confederation , the civil authorities , or the military commanders to mitigate in the least the rigors of the persecution of the Catholic Church . Insult , too , -isaia- added to persecution . Wicked men_have tried to place the Church in a bad light before the people ; some , for example , uttering the most brazen lies in public assemblies . But when a Catholic tries to answer them , he -isaia- prevented from speaking by catcalls and personal insults hurled -atti_degli_apostoli- his head . Others use hostile newspapers in order to obscure the truth and to malign '' Catholic Action . If , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of the persecution , Catholics were able to make a defense of their religion in the public press by means of articles which made clear the truth and answered the lies and errors of their enemies , it -isaia-_now no longer permitted these citizens , who love their_country just as much as other citizens do , to raise their voices in protest . As a matter of fact , they_are_not even allowed to express their sorrow over the injuries done to the Faith of their fathers and to the liberty of divine_worship . We , however , moved profoundly as We are by the consciousness of the duties imposed upon Us by our Apostolic office , will cry out to heaven , Venerable Brothers , so that_the_whole Catholic world may hear from the lips of the Common Father of all the story of the insane tyranny of the enemies of the Church , on the one_hand , and on the other that of the heroic virtue and constancy of the bishops_,_priests , religious congregations , and laity ot Mexico . All foreign priests and religious men have_been expelled from the country . Schools for the religious education of boys and girls have_been closed , either because_they_are known publicly under a religious name or because_they happen to possess a statue or some other religious object . Many seminaries likewise , schools , insane asylums , convents , institutions connected_with churches have_been closed . In practically all the states of the Republic the number of priests_who may exercise the sacred_ministry has_been limited and fixed -atti_degli_apostoli- the barest minimum . Even these latter are_not allowed to exercise their sacred office unless they_have beforehand registered with the civil authorities and have obtained permission from them so to function . In certain sections of the country restrictions have_been placed on the ministry of priests which , if they_were not so sad , would be laughable in the extreme . For example , certain regulations demand_that priests must be of an age fixed by law , that_they must be civilly married , and they_are_not allowed to baptize except with flowing water . In one of the states of the Confederation it has_been decreed that_only one bishop_-isaia- permitted to live within_the territory of said state , by reason of which law two other bishops were constrained to exile themselves from their dioceses . Moreover , because of circumstances imposed upon them by law , some bishops have_had to leave their diocese , others have_been forced to appear before the courts , several were arrested , and practically all the others live from day to day in imminent danger of being arrested . Again , every Mexican citizen who_-isaia- engaged in the education of children or of youth , or holds any public office whatsoever , has_been ordered to make known publicly whether he accepts the policies of the President and approves of the war which_-isaia- now being waged on the Catholic Church . The majority of these same individuals were forced , under threat of losing their positions , to take_part , together_with_the army and laboring men , in a parade sponsored by the Regional Confederation of the Workingmen of Mexico , a socialist organization . This parade took_place in Mexico City and in other towns of the Republic on the same day . It was followed by impious speeches to the populace . The whole procedure was organized to obtain , by means of these public outcries and the applause of those_who took part in it , and by heaping all kinds of abuse on the Church , popular approval of the acts of the President . But the cruel exercise of arbitrary power on the part of the enemies of the Church has not stopped -atti_degli_apostoli- these acts . Both men_and_women_who defended the rights of the Church and the cause of religion , either in speeches or by distributing leaflets and pamphlets , were hurried before the courts and sent to prison . Again , whole colleges of canons were rushed off to jail , the aged being carried there in their beds . Priests and laymen have_been cruelly put to death in the very streets or in the public squares which front the churches . May God grant that the responsible authors of so many grave crimes return soon to their better selves and throw themselves in sorrow and with true contrition on the divine mercy ; We are convinced that_this_-isaia- the noble revenge on their murderers which Our children who_have_been so unjustly put to death are_now asking from God . We think it well -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point , Venerable Brothers , to review for you in a few words how the bishops_,_priests , and faithful of Mexico have organized resistance and '' set up a wall for the House of Israel , to stand in battle . There cannot be the slightest doubt of the fact_that the Mexican hierarchy have unitedly used every_means within their_power to defend the liberty and good name of the Church . In the first_place , they indited a joint pastoral letter to their_people in which_they proved beyond cavil that the clergy had always acted toward_the rulers of the Republic motivated by a love for peace , with prudence and in all patience ; that_they had even suffered , in a spirit of almost too much tolerance , laws which_were unjust ; they admonished the faithful , outlining the divine constitution of the Church , that_they , too , must_always persevere in their religion , in such_a_way_that they_shall '' obey God rather_than men '' Acts v , on every occasion when anyone tries to impose on them laws which_are no less contrary to the very idea of law and do not merit the name of law , as they_are inimical to the constitution and existence itself of the Church . When the President of the Republic had promulgated his untimely and unjust decree of interpretation of the Constitution , by means of another joint pastoral letter the Bishops protested and pointed_out that to accept such a law was nothing less_than to desert the Church and hand her over a slave to the civil authorities . Even if this had_been done , it was apparent to all that_such an act would neither satisfy her persecutors nor stop them in the pursuit of their nefarious intentions . The Bishops in such circumstances preferred to put an end to public religious functions . Therefore , they ordered the complete suspension of every act of public worship which_cannot take_place without_the presence of the clergy , in all the churches of their diocese , beginning the last day of July , on which day the law in question went into_effect . Moreover , since_the civil authorities had ordered that all the churches must be turned over to the care of laymen , chosen by the mayors of the different municipalities , and could_not be held in any manner whatsoever by those_who were named or designated for_such an office by the bishops or priests , which act transferred the possessions of the churches from the ecclesiastical authority to that of the state , the Bishops practically everywhere interdicted the faithful from accepting a place on such committees bestowed on them by the Government and even from entering a church_which was no longer under the control of the Church . In some dioceses , due to difference of time_and_place , other arrangements were made . In spite of all this , do not think , Venerable Brothers , that the Mexican hierarchy lost any opportunity or occasion by means of which they_might do their_part in calming popular feelings and bringing_about concord despite the fact_that they distrusted , or it would be better perhaps to say despaired of , a happy outcome to all these troubles . It -isaia- sufficient to recall in this_context that the Bishops of Mexico City , who act in the capacity of procurators for their colleagues , wrote a very courteous and respectful letter to the President of the Republic in the interests of the Bishops of Huejutla , who had_been arrested in a most outrageous manner and with a great display of armed force , and had_been ordered taken to the city of Pachuca . The President replied to this_letter by means of a hateful angry screed , a fact now become notorious . Again , when it happened that certain personages , lovers of peace , had spontaneously intervened so as to bring_about a conversation between_the President and the Archbishop of Morelia and the Bishop of Tabasco , the parties in question talked together for a long time and on many subjects , but_with no results . Again , the Bishops debated whether_they should ask the House of Representatives for the abrogation of those laws which_were against the rights of the Church or if they_should continue , as before , their so called passive resistance to these laws . As a matter of fact , there existed many good reasons which seemed to them to render useless the presentation of such a petition to Congress . However , they did present_the petition , which_was written by Catholics quite capable of doing so because_of_their knowledge of law , every word of which_was , moreover , weighed by the Bishops themselves_with the utmost care . To this petition of the hierarchy there_was added , due to the zealous efforts of the members of the Federation for the Defense of Religious Liberty , about which organization We shall_have something to say later on in this_letter , a great number of signatures of citizens , both men_and_women . The Bishops had not_been wrong in their anticipations of what would take_place . Congress rejected the proposed petition almost unanimously , only_one voting in favor of it , and the reason they alleged for_this act was that the Bishops had_been deprived of juridical personality , since_they had_already appealed in this_matter to the Pope and therefore they_had proven themselves unwilling to acknowledge_the laws of Mexico . Such being the facts , what remained for the Bishops to do if not to decide that , until these unjust laws had_been repealed , neither they nor the faithful would change in the slightest the policy which_they had adopted ? The civil authorities of Mexico , abusing both their_power and the really remarkable patience of the people , are_now in a position to menace the clergy and the Mexican people_with even_more severe punishments than those already inflicted . But how are we to overcome and conquer men of this type who_are committed to the use of every type of infamy , unless we are willing , as they insist , to conclude an agreement with_them which_cannot but injure the sacred cause of the liberty of the Church ? . The clergy have imitated the truly wonderful example of constancy given them by the Bishops and have themselves in turn given no less brilliant an example of fortitude through all the tedious changes of the great conflict . This example of extraordinary virtue on their_part has_been a great comfort to Us . We have_made it known to the whole Catholic world and We praise them because '' they_are worthy . iii , And in this special context , when We recall that_every imaginable artifice was employed , that all the power and vexatious tactics of our adversaries had but_one purpose , to alienate both the clergy_and_people from their allegiance to the hierarchy and to this Apostolic See , and that despite all this only_one or two priests , from among the four thousand , betrayed in a shameful manner their holy office , it certainly seems to Us that there_-isaia-_nothing which We cannot hope_for from the Mexican clergy . As a matter of fact , We behold these priests standing shoulder to shoulder , obedient and respectful to the commands of their prelates despite the fact_that to obey means in the majority of cases serious dangers for themselves , for they_must live from their holy office , and since_they are poor and do not themselves possess anything and the Church cannot support them , they_are obliged to live bravely in poverty and in misery ; they_must say Mass in private ; they_must do all within their_power to provide_for the spiritual needs of their flocks , to keep alive and increase the flame of piety in those round about them ; moreover , by their example , counsels and exhortations , they_must lift the thoughts of their fellow citizens to the highest ideals and strengthen their wills so that_they , too , will persevere in their passive resistance . Is it any wonder , then_,_that the wrath and blind hatred of our enemies are directed principally and before all else against the priesthood ? The clergy , on their side , have_not hesitated to go to prison when ordered , and even to face death itself with serenity and courage . We have heard recently of something which surpasses anything as yet perpetrated under the guise of these wicked laws , and which , as a matter of fact , sounds the very depths of wickedness , for We have learned that certain priests were suddenly set upon while celebrating Mass in their_own homes or in the homes of friends , that the Blessed Eucharist was outraged in the basest manner , and the priests themselves carried off to prison . Nor can We praise enough the courageous faithful of Mexico who_have understood only too well how important it -isaia- for them that a Catholic nation in matters so serious and holy as the worship of God , the liberty of the Church , and the eternal salvation_of_souls should_not depend upon the arbitrary will and audacious acts of a few men , but should be governed under the mercy of God only by laws which_are just , which_are conformable to natural , divine , and ecclesiastical law . A word of very_special praise -isaia- due those Catholic organizations , which during all these trying times have stood like soldiers side to side with the clergy . The members of these organiza tions , to the limit of their_power , not_only have_made provisions to maintain and assist their clergy financially , they_also watch over and take_care of the churches , teach catechism to the children , and like sentinels stand guard to warn the clergy when their ministrations are needed so that_no_one may be deprived of the help of the priest . What We have just written -isaia- true of all these organizations . We wish , however , to say a word in particular about the principal organizations , so that_each may know that_it_-isaia- highly -apocalisse- proved and even praised by the Vicar of Jesus Christ . First of all We mention the Knights of Columbus , an organization which_-isaia- found in all the states of the Republic and which fortunately -isaia- made up of active and industrious members who , because_of_their practical lives and open profession of the Faith , as well as by their zeal in assisting the Church , have brought great honor upon themselves . This organization promotes two types of activites which_are needed now more_than_ever . In the first_place , the National Sodality of Fathers of Families , the program of which_-isaia- to give a Catholic education to their_own children , to protect the rights of Christian parents with_regard to education , and in cases where children attend the public schools to provide_for them a sound and complete training in their religion . Secondly , the Federation for the Defense of Religious Liberty , which_was recently organized when it became clear as the noonday sun that the Church was menaced by a veritable ocean of troubles . This Federation soon spread to all parts of the Republic . Its members attempted , working in harmony and with assiduity , to organize and instruct Catholics so that they_would be able to present a united invincible front to the enemy . No less deserving of the Church and the fatherland as the Knights of Columbus have_been and still are , We mention two other organizations , each of which_has , following its_own program , a special relation to what_-isaia- known as '' Catholic Social Action . '' One -isaia- the Catholic Society of Mexican Youth , and the other , the Union of Catholic Women of Mexico . These two sodalities , over and above the work which_-isaia- special to each of them , promote and do all they_can to have others promote the activities of the above mentioned Federation for the Defense of Religious Liberty . Without going into details about their_work , with pleasure We desire to call to your attention , Venerable Brothers , but a single fact , namely_,_that all the members of these organizations , both men_and_women , are so brave that , instead of fleeing danger , they go out in search of it , and even rejoice when it falls to their share to suffer persecution from the enemies of the Church . What a beautiful spectacle this , that_-isaia- thus given to the world , to angels , and to men ! How worthy of eternal praise are such deeds ! As a matter of fact , as We have pointed_out above , many individuals , members either of the Knights of Columbus , or officers of the Federation , of the Union of Catholic Women of Mexico , or of the Society of Mexican Youth , have_been taken to prison handcuffed , through the public streets , surrounded by armed soldiers , locked up in foul jails , harshly treated , and punished with prison sentences or fines . Moreover , Venerable Brothers , and in narrating this We can scarcely keep back Our tears , some of these young_men and boys have gladly met death , the rosary in their hands and the name of Christ King on their lips . Young girls , too , who_were imprisoned , were criminally outraged , and these acts were deliberately made public in order to intimidate other young women and to cause them the more_easily to fail in their_duty toward_the Church . No one , surely , Venerable Brothers , can hazard a prediction or foresee in imagination the hour when_the good God will_bring to an end such calamities . We do know this much : The day will come when_the Church of Mexico will_have respite from this veritable tempest of hatred , for the reason_that , according to the words of God '' there_-isaia- no wisdom , there_-isaia- no prudence , there_-isaia- no counsel against the Lord '' Prov . xxi , and '' the gates of hell shall_not prevail '' Matt . xvi , against the Spotless Bride of Christ . The Church which , from the day of Pentecost , has_been destined here below to a never ending life_,_which went forth_from the upper chamber into_the_world endowed_with the gifts and inspirations of the Holy Spirit , what_has_been her_mission during the last twenty centuries and in every country of the world if not , after_the example of her Divine Founder , '' to go about doing good '' ? Acts x , Certainly this_work of the Church should_have gained for_her the love of all men ; unfortunately the very contrary has happend as her Divine Master Himself predicted Matt . x , , would be the case . At times the bark of Peter , favored by the winds , goes happily forward ; -atti_degli_apostoli- other times it appears to be swallowed up by the waves and on the point of being lost . Has not this ship always aboard the Divine Pilot who knows when to calm the angry waves and the winds ? And who_-isaia- it but Christ Himself Who alone_-isaia- all powerful , who brings it about_that every persecution which_-isaia- launched against the faithful should react to the lasting benefit of the Church ? As St . Hilary writes , '' it -isaia- a prerogative of the Church that she_-isaia- the vanquisher when she_-isaia- persecuted , that_she captures our intellects when her doctrines are questioned , that_she conquers all -atti_degli_apostoli- the very moment when she_-isaia- abandoned by all . Hilary of Poitiers De Trinitate , Bk . If those men_who now in Mexico persecute their_brothers and fellowcitizens for no other reason than that_these latter are guilty of keeping the laws of God , would only recall to memory and consider dispassionately the vicissitudes of their_country as history reveals them to us , they_must recognize and publicly confess that whatever there_-isaia- of progress , of civilization , of the good and the beautiful , in their_country -isaia- due solely to the Catholic Church . In fact every man knows that after_the introduction of Christianity into Mexico , the priests and religious especially , who are_now being persecuted with_such cruelty by an ungrateful government , worked without rest and despite all the obstacles placed in their_way , on the one_hand by the colonists who_were moved by greed for gold and on the other by the natives who_were still barbarians , to promote greatly in those vast regions both the splendor of the worship of God and the benefits of the Catholic religion , works and institutions of charity , schools and colleges for the education of the people and their instruction in letters , the sciences , both sacred and profane , in the arts and the crafts . One thing more remains for Us to do , Venerable Brothers , namely , to pray and implore Our Lady of Guadalupe , heavenly patroness of the Mexican people , that_she pardon all these injuries and especially_those which_have_been committed against her , that_she ask of God that peace and concord may return to her people . And if , in the hidden designs of God that day which We so greatly desire -isaia- far distant , may she in the meantime console her faithful children of Mexico and strengthen them in their resolve to maintain their liberty by the profession of their Faith . In the meanwhile , as an augury of the grace of God and as proof of Our fatherly love , We bestow from Our heart on you , Venerable Brothers , and especially on those bishops_who rule_the Church of Mexico , on all your_clergy and your_people , the Apostolic Blessing . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the eighteenth day of November , in the year , the fifth of Our Pontificate .
