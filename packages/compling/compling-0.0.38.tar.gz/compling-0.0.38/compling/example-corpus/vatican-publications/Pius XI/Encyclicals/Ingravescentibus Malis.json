More than_once have We asserted and We recently repeated this in the Encyclical Letter Divini Redemptoris Acta Ap . that_there_-isaia- no remedy for the ever growing evils of our_times except a return to Our Lord Jesus Christ and to His most_holy precepts . Truly , only He '' hath the words of eternal_life '' Cf . John , vi , , and individuals and society can_only fall_into immediate and miserable ruin if they ignore the majesty of God and repudiate His Law . However , anyone_who studies with diligence the records of the Catholic Church will easily recognize_that the true patronage of the Virgin Mother of God -isaia- linked_with all the annals of the Christian name . When , in fact , errors everywhere diffused were bent upon rending the seamless robe of the Church and upon throwing the Catholic world into confusion , our fathers turned with confident soul to her '' alone who destroys all heresies in the world '' Roman Breviary , and the victory won through_her brought the return of tranquillity . When the impious Mohammedan power , trusting in its powerful fleet and war hardened armies , threatened the peoples of Europe with ruin and slavery , then upon the suggestion of the Sovereign Pontiff the protection of the heavenly Mother was fervently implored and the enemy was defeated and his ships sunk . Thus the Faithful of every_age , both in public misfortune and in private need , turn in supplication to Mary , the benignant , so that_she may come to their aid and grant help and remedy against sorrows of body_and_soul . And never was her most powerful aid hoped for in vain by those_who besought it with pious and trustful prayer . But also in our_day , dangers no less grave than in the past beset civil and religious society . In fact , because the supreme and eternal authority of God , which commands and forbids , -isaia- despised and completely repudiated by men , the result -isaia- that the consciousness of Christian duty -isaia- weakened , and that_faith becomes tepid in souls or entirely lost , and his afterward affects and ruins the very basis of human_society . Thus on the one_hand are seen citizens intent on an atrocious struggle among_themselves because some are provided with abundant riches and others must gain bread for themselves and their dear ones by the sweat of their brows . Indeed , as we all know , in some regions the evil had reached such a pitch that it seeks to destroy all private right of property , so that everything might be shared in common . On the other_hand , there_are not lacking men_who declare that_they honor and exalt , above all , the power of the State . They say they_must use every_means to assure civil order and enforce authority , and pretend that_only thus are they able totally to repulse the execrable theories of the Communists . However , they despise the light of evangelic wisdom and endeavor to revive the errors of the pagans and their way_of_life . To this_-isaia- added the clever and lamentable sect of those_who , denying and hating God , declare themselves the enemies of the Eternal , and who insinuate themselves everywhere . They discredit and uproot all religious belief from souls . Finally , they trample on every_human and Divine right . And while they cast scorn on the hope of heavenly reward , they incite men to seek , even by illicit means , false earthly happiness , and therefore drive them_with brazen temerity to the dissolution of the social_order , causing disorder , cruel rebellions and even the conflagration of civil war . Nevertheless , Venerable Brethren , though such_great and numerous evils hang over us , and others still greater are to be feared for the future , we must_not lose heart nor let_the confident hope_that rests solely on God become fainter . He who '' made the nations of the earth for health '' Cf . Wisdom i , without_doubt will_not let those perish whom He has redeemed with His Precious Blood , nor will He abandon His Church . But rather , as We said in the beginning , shall We beseech God through the mediation of the Blessed Virgin , so acceptable to Him , since , to use the words of St . Bernard : '' Such -isaia- the will of God , who_has wished that_we_should have all things through Mary . '' Sermon on the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary . Among the various supplications with_which we successfully appeal to the Virgin Mother of God , the Holy Rosary without_doubt occupies a special and distinct place . This prayer , which some call the Psalter of the Virgin or Breviary of the Gospel and of Christian life , was described and recommended by Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Leo XIII , with_these vigorous passages : '' Very admirable -isaia- this crown interwoven with the angelic salutation which_-isaia- interposed in the Sunday prayer , and unites with it the obligation of interior meditation . It -isaia- an excellent manner of prayer . and very useful for the attainment of immortal life '' Acta Leonis , , Vol . And this_can well be deduced from the very flowers that form this mystic garland . What prayers in fact can be found more adaptable and holy ? This first -isaia- that_which our Divine Redeemer Himself pronounced when His disciples asked Him : '' Lord , teach us to pray '' Luke xi , ; a very holy supplication which both offers us the way as far as it -isaia- possible_for us to render glory to God , and also takes into_account all the necessities of our body_and_soul . How can the Eternal Father , when prayed to with the very words of His Son , refuse to come to our aid ? . The other prayer_-isaia- the Angelic Salutation , which begins with the eulogies of the Archangel Gabriel and of St . Elizabeth , and ends with that_very pious supplication by which we beg the help of the Blessed Virgin now and -atti_degli_apostoli- the hour of our death . To these invocations , said aloud , -isaia- added the contemplation of the sacred mysteries , through_which they place , as it were , under our_eyes the joys , sorrows and triumphs of Jesus Christ and of His Mother , so that we receive relief and comfort in our sorrows . Following those most_holy examples , we ascend to the happiness of the heavenly country by steps of ever higher virtue . This practice of piety , Venerable Brethren , admirably diffused by St . Dominic , not_without the heavenly suggestion and inspiration of the Virgin Mother of God , -isaia- without_doubt easy for all , even_for the ignorant and the simple . But those wander from the path of truth who consider this_devotion merely an annoying formula repeated with monotonous singsong intonation , and refuse it as good only_for children and silly women ! . In this_regard , it -isaia- to be noted_that both piety and love , though always renewing the same words , do not_always repeat the same thing but always express something new issuing from the intimate sentiment of devotion . And besides , this mode of prayer has the perfume of evangelic simplicity and requires humility of spirit ; and , if we disdain humility , as the Divine Redeemer teaches , it will be impossible for us to enter_the heavenly kingdom : '' Amen , I say to you , unless you become as little children you shall_not enter_the kingdom_of_heaven '' Matt . Nevertheless , if men in our century , with its derisive pride , refuse the Holy Rosary , there_-isaia- an innumerable multitude of holy men of every_age and every condition who have_always held it dear . They have recited it with_great devotion , and in every moment they_have used it as a powerful weapon to put the demons to flight , to preserve the integrity of life , to acquire virtue more_easily , and in a word to attain real peace among_men . Nor are there lacking men famous as to doctrine and wisdom who , although intensely occupied in scientific study and researches , never even_for a day fail to pray fervently on bended knee , before the image of the Virgin , in this_most pious form . Thus kings and princes , however burdened with most urgent occupations and affairs , made it their_duty to recite the Rosary . This mystic crown , then , not_only -isaia- found in and glides through the hands of the poor , but it also -isaia- honored by citizens of every social rank . And We do not wish here to pass over in silence the fact_that the Blessed Virgin herself , even in our_times , has solicitously recommended this manner of prayer , when_she appeared and taught it to the innocent girl in the Grotto of Lourdes . Therefore why should We not hope for_every grace if We supplicate Our Heavenly Mother in this manner with due disposition and holiness ? We desire very earnestly , Venerable Brethren , that the Holy Rosary should be recited in a special manner in the month of October and with increased devotion both in the churches and in homes . And so much the more must it be done since_the enemies of the Divine Name that_-isaia- , those_who_have rebelled against and denied and scorned the Eternal God spread snares for the Catholic Faith and the liberty due to the Church , and finally rebel with insane efforts against divine and human_rights , to send mankind to ruin and perdition . Through efficacious recourse to the Virgin Mother of God , they_may be finally bent and led to penance and return to the straight path , trusting to the care and protection of Mary . The Holy Virgin who once victoriously drove the terrible sect of the Albigenses from Christian countries , now suppliantly invoked by us , will turn aside the new errors , especially_those of Communism , which reminds us in many_ways , in its motives and misdeeds , of the ancient ones . And as in the times of the Crusades , in all Europe there_was raised one voice of the people , one supplication ; so today , in all the world , the cities , and even the smallest villages , united with courage and strength , with filial and constant insistence , the people seek to obtain from the great Mother of God the defeat of the enemies of Christian and human civilization , to the end that true peace may shine again over tired and erring men . If , then , all will do this with due disposition , with_great faith and with fervent piety , it -isaia- right to hope_that as in the past , so in our_day , the Blessed Virgin will obtain from her_divine Son that the waves of the present tempests be calmed and that a brilliant victory crown this rivalry of Christians in prayer . The Holy Rosary , besides , not_only serves admirably to overcome the enemies of God and Religion , but -isaia-_also a stimulus and spur to the practice of evangelic virtues which it injects and cultivates in our souls . Above all , it nourishes the Catholic Faith , which flourishes again by due meditation on the sacred mysteries , and raises minds to the truth revealed to us by God . Every one_can understand how salutary it -isaia- , especially in our_times wherein sometimes a certain annoyance of the things of the spirit_-isaia- felt even among the Faithful , and a dislike , as it were , for the Christian doctrine . Therefore , revive the hope of immortal welfare , while the triumph of Jesus Christ and of His Mother , meditated on by us in the last part of the Rosary , shows us Heaven open and invites us to the conquest of the Eternal Country . Thus while an unbridled longing for the things of this earth has penetrated into the hearts of mortals and each_one more ardently longs for the short lived riches and ephemeral pleasures , all feel a fruitful call back to the heavenly treasures '' where thieves do not break in and neither rust nor moth doth consume '' Matt . xii , , and to the wealth that will_never perish . And the charity which_has_been weakened and cooled in many , how_can it fail to be rekindled into love in the souls of those_who recall with a full heart_the tortures and death of our Redeemer and the afflictions of His Sorrowful Mother ? From this charity towards God , then , there cannot_but rise a more intense love of one s neighbor if one dwells on the labors and sorrows that Our Lord suffered for all , reinstating the lost inheritance of the children of God . Therefore see to it , Venerable Brethren , that_such a fruitful practice shall be more diffused , more highly esteemed by all , and that common piety be increased . Through your work and that of the priests_who help you in the care of souls , its praises and advantages shall be preached and repeated to the Faithful of every social class . From it , the young will draw fresh energy with_which to control the rebellious tendencies to evil and to preserve intact the stainless purity of the soul ; also in it , the old will again find repose , relief and peace from their anxious cares . To those_who devote_themselves to Catholic Action may it be a spur to impel them to a more fervent and active work of apostolate ; and to all those who_suffer in any_way , especially_the dying , may it bring comfort and increase the hope of eternal happiness . The fathers and mothers of families particularly must give an example to their_children , especially_when , -atti_degli_apostoli- sunset , they gather together after_the day s work , within_the domestic walls , and recite the Holy Rosary on bended knees before the image of the Virgin , together fusing voice , faith and sentiment . This -isaia- a beautiful and salutary custom , from which certainly there cannot_but be derived tranquillity and abundance of heavenly_gifts for the household . When very frequently We receive newly married_couples in audience and address paternal words to them , We give_them rosaries , We recommend these to them earnestly , and We exhort them , citing Our own example , not to let even one_day pass without saying the Rosary , no matter how burdened they_may be with many cares and labors . For these reasons , Venerable Brethren , We have thought fit earnestly to exhort you , and through you , all the Faithful , to carry_out this pious practice . Nor do We doubt_that you , listening , with your usual response to Our paternal invitation will bring_about abundant fruits once_more . And in addressing this Encyclical to you , another motive impels Us . We wish_that , together_with Us , Our many children in Jesus shall unite and render thanks to the Mother of God for the better health We have happily regained . This grace , as We have_had occasion to write Cf . Pacelli , Osservatore Romano , September , , We attribute to the special intercession of the virgin of Lisieux , St . Therese of the Child Jesus . But We know , though , that everything comes to us from Almighty God through the hands of Our Lady . And lastly , as there_has been launched in the public press with rash insolence , a very grave injury to the Blessed Virgin , We cannot do less_than profit by this occasion to offer , together_with_the Episcopate and the people of that nation which venerates Mary as '' Queen of the Kingdom of Poland , '' and with the homage of our piety , due reparation to the august Queen , and denounce to the whole_world this sacrilege committed with impunity , as a painful and unworthy thing . Meanwhile , with a full heart We impart to you , Venerable Brethren , and to the flock entrusted to the care of each of you , the Apostolic Blessing as an augury of heavenly graces and in token to Our Paternal benevolence . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Castel Gandolfo , near Rome , on the th day of the month of September , on the Feast of the Dedication of St . Michael the Archangel , in the year , the sixteenth of Our Pontificate .
