Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Blessing . Our Most Merciful Redeemer , after He had wrought salvation for mankind on the tree of the Cross and before He ascended from out this_world to the Father , said to his Apostles and Disciples , to console them in their anxiety , '' Behold I -amos- with you all days , even to the consummation of the world . These words , which_are indeed most pleasing , are a cause of all hope and security , and they bring us , Venerable Brethren , ready succor , whenever we look round from this watch tower raised on high and see all human_society laboring amid so many evils and miseries , and the Church herself beset without ceasing by attacks and machinations . For as in the beginning this Divine promise lifted up the despondent spirit of the Apostles and enkindled and inflamed them so that they_might cast the seeds of the Gospel teaching throughout_the whole_world ; so ever since it has strengthened the Church unto her victory over the gates of hell . In sooth , Our Lord Jesus Christ has_been with_his Church in every_age , but He has_been with_her with more present aid and protection whenever she has_been assailed by graver perils and difficulties . For the remedies adapted to the condition of time and circumstances , are always supplied by Divine Wisdom , who reacheth from end to end mightily , and ordereth all things sweetly Wisdom viii , . But in this latter age also , '' the hand of the Lord -isaia- not shortened '' Isaias lix , , more especially since error has crept in and has spread far and wide , so that it might well be feared that the fountains of Christian life might be in a manner dried up , where men_are cut off from the love and knowledge of God . Now , since it may be that_some of the people do not_know , and others do not heed , those complaints which_the most loving Jesus made when He manifested Himself to Margaret Mary Alacoque , and those_things likewise which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time He asked and expected of men , for their_own ultimate profit , it -isaia-_our pleasure , Venerable Brethren , to speak to you for a little while concerning the duty of honorable satisfaction which we all owe to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus , with the intent that_you_may , each of you , carefully teach your_own flocks those things_which we set before you , and stir them up to put the same in practice . Among the many proofs of the boundless benignity of our Redeemer , there_-isaia-_one that stands out conspicuously , to wit the fact_that when_the charity of Christian people was growing cold , the Divine Charity itself was set_forth to be honored by a special worship , and the riches of its bounty was_made widely manifest by that form of devotion wherein worship -isaia- given to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus , '' In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge '' Coloss . For as in olden time_when mankind came forth_from Noe s ark , God set His '' bow in the clouds '' Genesis ix , , shining as the sign of a friendly covenant ; so in the most turbulent times of a more_recent age , when_the Jansenist heresy , the most crafty of them all , hostile to love and piety towards God , was creeping in and preaching that God was_not to be loved as a father but_rather to be feared as an implacable judge ; then the most benign Jesus showed his_own most Sacred Heart to the nations lifted up as a standard of peace and charity portending no doubtful victory in the combat . And indeed Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Leo XIII , admiring the timely opportuneness of the devotion to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus , said very aptly in his Encyclical Letter , '' Annum Sacrum , '' '' When in the days near her origin , the Church was oppressed under the yoke of the Caesars the Cross shown on high to the youthful Emperor was -atti_degli_apostoli- once an omen and a cause of the victory that speedily followed . And here today another most auspicious and most divine sign -isaia- offered to our sight , to wit the most Sacred Heart of Jesus , with a Cross set above it shining with most resplendent brightness in the midst of flames . Herein must all hopes be set , from hence must the salvation of men be sought and expected . And rightly indeed -isaia- that said , Venerable Brethren . For -isaia- not the sum of all religion and therefore the pattern of more_perfect life , contained in that_most auspicious sign and in the form of piety that follows from it inasmuch as it more readily leads the minds_of_men to an intimate knowledge of Christ Our Lord , and more efficaciously moves their_hearts to love Him more vehemently and to imitate Him more_closely ? It -isaia- no wonder , therefore_,_that Our Predecessors have constantly defended this_most approved form of devotion from the censures of calumniators , and have extolled it with high praise and promoted it very zealously , as the needs of time and circumstance demanded . Moreover , by the inspiration of God s grace , it has come to pass that the pious devotion of the faithful towards_the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus has made great increase in the course of time ; hence pious confraternities to promote the worship of the Divine Heart are everywhere erected , hence too the custom of receiving Holy Communion on the first Friday of every month -atti_degli_apostoli- the desire of Christ Jesus , a custom which now prevails everywhere . But assuredly among_those things_which properly pertain to the worship of the Most Sacred Heart , a special place must_be_given to that Consecration , whereby we devote ourselves and all things_that_are ours to the Divine Heart of Jesus , acknowledging that we have_received all things from the everlasting love of God . When Our Savior had taught Margaret Mary , the most innocent disciple of His Heart , how_much He desired that_this duty of devotion should be rendered to him by men , moved in this not_so_much by His own right as by His immense charity for us ; she herself , with_her spiritual father , Claude de la Colombiere , rendered it the first of all . Thereafter followed , in the course of time , individual men , then private families and associations , and lastly civil magistrates , cities and kingdoms . But since in the last century , and in this present century , things have come to such a pass , that by the machinations of wicked men the sovereignty of Christ Our Lord has_been denied and war -isaia- publicly waged against the Church , by passing laws and promoting plebiscites repugnant to Divine and natural_law , nay more by holding assemblies of them that cry out , '' We will not_have this man to reign over us '' Luke xix , : from the aforesaid Consecration there burst forth over against them in keenest opposition the voice of all the clients of the Most Sacred Heart , as it were one voice , to vindicate His glory and to assert His rights : '' Christ must reign '' Corinthians xv , ; '' Thy kingdom come '' Matth . From this -atti_degli_apostoli- length it happily came to pass that -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of this century the whole_human_race which Christ , in whom all things_are re established Ephes . i , , possesses by native right as His own , was dedicated to the same Most Sacred Heart , with the applause of the whole Christian world , by Our Predecessor of happy_memory , Leo XIII . Now these_things so auspiciously and happily begun as we taught in Our Encyclical Letter '' Quas primas , '' we Ourselves , consenting to very many long continued desires and prayers of Bishops and people , brought to completion and perfected , by God s grace , when -atti_degli_apostoli- the close of the Jubilee Year , We instituted the Feast of Christ the King of All , to be solemnly celebrated throughout_the whole Christian world . Now when we did this , not_only did we set in a clear light that supreme sovereignty which Christ holds over the whole universe , over civil and domestic society , and over individual men , but_-atti_degli_apostoli-_the_same_time we anticipated the joys of that_most auspicious day , whereon the whole_world will gladly and willingly render obedience to the most sweet lordship of Christ the King . For this_reason , We decreed -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time that_this same Consecration should be renewed every year on the occasion of that appointed festal day , so that the fruit of this_same Consecration might be obtained more certainly and more abundantly , and all peoples might be joined together in Christian charity and in the reconciliation of peace , in the Heart of the King of kings and Lord of lords . But to all these duties , more especially to that fruitful Consecration which_was in a manner confirmed by the sacred solemnity of Christ the King , something else must needs be added , and it -isaia- concerning this that_it_-isaia- our pleasure to speak with you more -atti_degli_apostoli- length , Venerable Brethren , on the present occasion : we mean_that duty of honorable satisfaction or reparation which_must be rendered to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus . For if the first_and_foremost thing in Consecration -isaia- this , that the creature s love should be given in return for the love of the Creator , another thing follows from this -atti_degli_apostoli- once , namely that to the same uncreated Love , if so be it has_been neglected by forgetfulness or violated by offense , some sort of compensation must be rendered for the injury , and this debt -isaia- commonly called by the name of reparation . Now though in both these_matters we are impelled by quite the same motives , none the less we are holden to the duty of reparation and expiation by a certain more valid title of justice and of love , of justice indeed , in order_that the offense offered to God by our sins may be expiated and that the violated order may be repaired by penance : and of love too so that_we_may suffer together_with Christ suffering and '' filled_with reproaches '' Lam . iii , , and for all our poverty may offer Him some little solace . For since we are all sinners and laden with many faults , our God must be honored by us not_only by that worship wherewith we adore His infinite Majesty with due homage , or acknowledge His supreme dominion by praying , or praise His boundless bounty by thanksgiving ; but besides this we must need make satisfaction to God the just avenger , '' for our numberless sins and offenses and negligences . '' To Consecration , therefore , whereby we are devoted to God and are_called holy to God , by that holiness and stability which , as the Angelic Doctor teaches , -isaia- proper to consecration da . , there_must be added expiation , whereby sins are wholly blotted out , lest the holiness of the supreme justice may punish our shameless unworthiness , and reject our offering as hateful rather_than accept it as pleasing . Moreover this_duty of expiation -isaia- laid upon the whole race of men since , as we are taught by the Christian faith , after Adam s miserable fall , infected by hereditary stain , subject to concupiscences and most wretchedly depraved , it would_have been thrust down into eternal destruction . This indeed -isaia- denied by the wise men of this age of ours , who following the ancient error of Pelagius , ascribe to human_nature a certain native virtue by which of its_own force it can go onward to higher things ; but the Apostle rejects these false opinions of human pride , admonishing us that we '' were by nature children of wrath '' Ephesians ii , . And indeed , even from the beginning , men in a manner acknowledged this common debt of expiation and , led by a certain natural instinct , they endeavored to appease God by public sacrifices . But no created power was sufficient to expiate the sins of men , if the Son of God had not assumed man s nature in order to redeem it . This , indeed , the Savior of men Himself declared by the mouth of the sacred Psalmist : '' Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not : but a body thou hast fitted to me : Holocausts for sin did_not please thee : then said I : Behold I come '' Hebrews x , . And in very deed , '' Surely He hath borne our infirmities , and carried our sorrows . He was wounded for our iniquities Isaias liii , , and He His own self bore our sins in His body upon the tree . Peter ii , , '' Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that_was against us , which_was contrary to us . And He has_taken the same out of the way , fastening it to the cross . '' Colossians ii , '' that we being dead to sins , should live to justice '' Peter ii , . Yet , though the copious redemption of Christ has abundantly forgiven us all offenses Cf . Colossians ii , , nevertheless , because of that wondrous divine dispensation whereby those things_that_are wanting of the sufferings of Christ are to be filled up in our flesh for His body which_-isaia- the Church Cf . Colossians i , , to the praises and satisfactions , '' which Christ in the name of sinners rendered unto God '' we can_also add our praises and satisfactions , and indeed it behoves us so to do . But we must ever remember that_the_whole virtue of the expiation depends on the one bloody sacrifice of Christ , which without intermission of time -isaia- renewed on our altars in an unbloody manner , '' For the victim -isaia- one_and_the_same , the same now offering by the ministry of priests , who then offered Himself on the cross , the manner alone of offering being different '' Council of Trent , Session XXIII , Chapter . Wherefore with this_most august Eucharistic Sacrifice there ought to be joined an oblation both of the ministers and of all the faithful , so that_they also may '' present themselves living sacrifices , holy , pleasing unto God '' Romans xii , . Cyprian does not_hesitate to affirm that '' the Lord s sacrifice -isaia- not celebrated with legitimate sanctification , unless our oblation and sacrifice correspond to His passion '' Ephesians . For this_reason , the Apostle admonishes us that '' bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus '' Corinthians iv , , and buried together_with Christ , and planted together in the likeness of His death Cf . Romans vi , , we must_not only crucify our flesh with the vices and concupiscences Cf . Galatians v , , '' flying the corruption of that concupiscence which_-isaia- in the world '' Peter i , , but '' that the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our bodies '' Corinthians iv , and being made partakers of His eternal priesthood we are to offer up '' gifts and sacrifices for sins '' Hebrews v , . Nor do those only enjoy a participation in this mystic priesthood and in the office of satisfying and sacrificing , whom our Pontiff Christ Jesus uses as His ministers to offer up the clean oblation to God s Name in every place from the rising of the sun to the going down Malachias i , , but the whole Christian people rightly called by the Prince of the Apostles '' a chosen generation , a kingly priesthood '' Peter ii , , ought to offer for sins both_for itself and for all mankind Cf . Hebrews v , , in much the same manner as every priest and pontiff '' taken from among_men , -isaia- ordained for men in the things_that appertain to God '' Hebrews v , . But the more perfectly that_our oblation and sacrifice corresponds to the sacrifice of Our Lord , that_-isaia- to say , the more perfectly we have immolated our love and our desires and have crucified our flesh by that mystic crucifixion of which_the Apostle speaks , the more abundant fruits of that propitiation and expiation shall we receive for ourselves and for others . For there_-isaia- a wondrous and close union of all the faithful with Christ , such as that_which prevails between_the head and the other members ; moreover by that mystic Communion of Saints which we profess in the Catholic creed , both individual men and peoples are joined together not only_with one_another but also_with him , '' who_-isaia- the head , Christ ; from whom_the whole_body , being compacted and fitly joined together , by what every joint supplieth , according to the operation in the measure of every_part , maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in charity '' Ephesians iv , . It was this indeed that the Mediator of God and men , Christ Jesus , when He was near to death , asked of His Father : '' I in them , and thou in me : that_they_may be made perfect in one '' John xvii , . Wherefore , even as consecration proclaims and confirms this union with Christ , so does expiation begin that_same union by washing away faults , and perfect it by participating in the sufferings of Christ , and consummate it by offering victims for the brethren . And this indeed was_the purpose of the merciful Jesus , when He showed His Heart to us bearing about it the symbols of the passion and displaying the flames of love , that_from the one we might know_the infinite malice of sin , and in the other we might admire the infinite charity of Our Redeemer , and so might have a more vehement hatred of sin , and make a more ardent return of love for His love . And truly the spirit of expiation or reparation has_always had the first_and_foremost place in the worship given to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus , and nothing_-isaia- more in keeping_with_the origin , the character , the power , and the distinctive practices of this form of devotion , as appears from the record of history and custom , as well as from the sacred_liturgy and the acts of the Sovereign Pontiffs . For when Christ manifested Himself to Margaret Mary , and declared to her the infinitude of His love , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , in the manner of a mourner , He complained that so many and such_great injuries were done to Him by ungrateful men and we would that these_words in which He made this complaint were fixed in the minds of the faithful , and were never blotted out by oblivion : '' Behold this Heart '' He said '' which_has loved men so much and has loaded them_with all benefits , and for_this boundless love has had no return but neglect , and contumely , and this often from those_who were bound by a debt and duty of a more special love . '' In order_that these faults might be washed away , He then recommended several things to be done , and in particular the following as most pleasing to Himself , namely that_men should approach the Altar with this_purpose of expiating sin , making what_-isaia- called a Communion of Reparation , and that_they_should likewise make expiatory supplications and prayers , prolonged for a whole hour , which_-isaia- rightly called the '' Holy Hour . '' These pious exercises have_been approved by the Church and have_also been enriched with copious indulgences . But how_can these rites of expiation bring solace now , when Christ -isaia-_already reigning in the beatitude of Heaven ? To this we may answer in some words of St . Augustine which_are very apposite here , '' Give me one_who loves , and he will understand what I say '' In Johannis evangelium , tract . For any_one who_has great love of God , if he will look back through the tract of past time may dwell in meditation on Christ , and see Him laboring for_man , sorrowing , suffering the greatest hardships , '' for us men and for our_salvation , '' well nigh worn out with sadness , with anguish , nay '' bruised for our sins '' Isaias liii , , and healing us by His bruises . And the minds of the pious meditate on all these_things the more truly , because the sins of men and their crimes committed in every_age were_the cause why Christ was delivered up to death , and now also they_would of themselves bring death to Christ , joined with the same griefs and sorrows , since each several sin in its_own way -isaia- held to renew the passion of Our Lord : '' Crucifying again to themselves the Son of God , and making him a mockery '' Hebrews vi , . Now if , because of our sins also which_were as yet in the future , but were foreseen , the soul of Christ became sorrowful unto death , it cannot be doubted that then , too , already He derived somewhat of solace from our reparation , which_was likewise foreseen , when '' there appeared to Him an angel from heaven '' Luke xxii , , in order_that His Heart , oppressed with weariness and anguish , might find consolation . And so even_now , in a wondrous yet true manner , we can and ought to console that Most Sacred Heart which_-isaia- continually wounded by the sins of thankless men , since as we also read in the sacred_liturgy Christ Himself , by the mouth of the Psalmist complains that He -isaia- forsaken by His friends : '' My Heart hath expected reproach and misery , and I looked for one that_would grieve together_with me , but_there was none : and for one that_would comfort me , and I found none '' Psalm lxviii , . To this it may be added that the expiatory passion of Christ -isaia- renewed and in a manner continued and fulfilled in His mystical_body , which_-isaia- the Church . For , to use once_more the words of St . Augustine , '' Christ suffered whatever it behoved Him to suffer ; now nothing_-isaia- wanting of the measure of the sufferings . Therefore the sufferings were fulfilled , but in the head ; there_were yet remaining the sufferings of Christ in His body '' In Psalm lxxxvi . This , indeed , Our Lord Jesus Himself vouchsafed to explain when , speaking to Saul , '' as yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter '' Acts ix , , He said , '' I -amos- Jesus whom thou persecutest '' Acts ix , , clearly signifying that_when persecutions are stirred up against the Church , the Divine Head of the Church -isaia- Himself attacked and troubled . Rightly , therefore , does Christ , still suffering in His mystical_body , desire to have us partakers of His expiation , and this -isaia-_also demanded by our intimate_union with Him , for since we are '' the body of Christ and members of member '' Corinthians xii , , whatever the head suffers , all the members must suffer with it Cf . Now , how_great -isaia- the necessity of this expiation or reparation , more especially in this our_age , will be manifest to every_one who , as we said -atti_degli_apostoli- the outset , will examine the world , '' seated in wickedness '' John v , , with_his eyes and with_his mind . For from all sides the cry of the peoples who_are mourning comes up to us , and their princes or rulers have indeed stood up and met together in one against the Lord and against His Church Cf . Throughout those regions indeed , we see_that all rights both human and Divine are confounded . Churches are thrown down and overturned , religious men and sacred virgins are torn from their homes and are afflicted with abuse , with barbarities , with hunger and imprisonment ; bands of boys and girls are snatched from the bosom of their mother the Church , and are induced to renounce Christ , to blaspheme and to attempt the worst crimes of lust ; the whole Christian people , sadly disheartened and disrupted , are continually in danger of falling away from the faith , or of suffering the most cruel death . These things in truth are so sad that_you might say that_such events foreshadow and portend the '' beginning of sorrows , '' that_-isaia- to say of those_that shall be brought by the man of sin , '' who_-isaia- lifted up above all that_-isaia- called God or -isaia- worshipped '' Thessalonians ii , . But it -isaia- yet more to be lamented , Venerable Brethren , that among the faithful themselves , washed in Baptism with the blood of the immaculate Lamb , and enriched with grace , there are_found so many men of every class , who laboring under an incredible ignorance of Divine things and infected with false doctrines , far from their Father s home , lead a life involved in vices , a life which_-isaia-_not brightened by the light of true faith , nor gladdened by the hope of future beatitude , nor refreshed and cherished by the fire of charity ; so that_they truly seem to sit in darkness and in the shadow of death . Moreover , among the faithful there_-isaia- a greatly increasing carelessness of ecclesiastical discipline , and of those ancient institutions on which all Christian life rests , by which domestic society_-isaia- governed , and the sanctity of marriage -isaia- safeguarded ; the education of children -isaia- altogether neglected , or else it -isaia- depraved by too indulgent blandishments , and the Church -isaia- even robbed of the power of giving the young a Christian education ; there_-isaia- a sad forgetfulness of Christian modesty especially in the life and the dress of women ; there_-isaia- an unbridled cupidity of transitory things , a want of moderation in civic affairs , an unbounded ambition of popular favor , a depreciation of legitimate authority , and lastly a contempt for the word of God , whereby faith itself_-isaia- injured , or -isaia- brought into proximate peril . But all these evils as it were culminate in the cowardice and the sloth of those_who , after_the manner of the sleeping and fleeing disciples , wavering in their_faith , miserably forsake Christ when He -isaia- oppressed by anguish or surrounded by the satellites of Satan , and in the perfidy of those others_who following_the_example of the traitor Judas , either partake of the holy table rashly and sacrilegiously , or go over to the camp of the enemy . And thus , even against our will , the thought rises in the mind_that now those days draw near of which Our Lord prophesied : '' And because iniquity hath abounded , the charity of many shall grow cold '' Matth . Now , whosoever of the faithful have piously pondered on all these_things must need be inflamed with the charity of Christ in His agony and make a more vehement endeavor to expiate their_own faults and those of others , to repair the honor of Christ , and to promote the eternal salvation_of_souls . And indeed that saying of the Apostle : '' Where sin abounded , grace did more abound '' Romans v , may be used in a manner to describe this present age ; for while the wickedness of men has_been greatly increased , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost , a marvelous increase has been_made in the number of the faithful of both sexes who with eager mind endeavor to make satisfaction for the many injuries offered to the Divine Heart , nay more they do not_hesitate to offer themselves to Christ as victims . For indeed if any_one will lovingly dwell on those_things of which_we_have been speaking , and will_have them deeply fixed in his mind , it cannot be but he will shrink with horror from all sin as from the greatest evil , and more_than this he will yield himself wholly to the will of God , and will strive to repair the injured honor of the Divine Majesty , as well by constantly praying , as by voluntary mortifications , by patiently bearing the afflictions that befall him , and lastly by spending his whole_life in this exercise of expiation . And for this_reason also there have_been established many religious families of men_and_women whose purpose it -isaia- by earnest service , both by day and by night , in some manner to fulfill the office of the Angel consoling Jesus in the garden ; hence come certain associations of pious men , approved by the Apostolic See and enriched with indulgences , who take upon themselves this_same duty of making expiation , a duty which_-isaia- to be fulfilled by fitting exercises of devotion and of the virtues ; hence lastly , to omit other_things , come the devotions and solemn demonstrations for the purpose of making reparation to the offended Divine honor , which_are inaugurated everywhere , not_only by pious members of the faithful , but by parishes , dioceses and cities . These things being so , Venerable Brethren , just as the rite of consecration , starting from humble beginnings , and afterwards more widely propagated , was -atti_degli_apostoli- length crowned with success by Our confirmation ; so in like_manner , we earnestly desire_that this custom of expiation or pious reparation , long since devoutly introduced and devoutly propagated , may also be more firmly sanctioned by Our Apostolic authority and more solemnly celebrated by the whole Catholic name . Wherefore , we decree and command that_every year on the Feast of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus , which feast indeed on this occasion we have ordered to be raised to the degree of a double of the first class with an octave in all churches throughout_the whole_world , the same expiatory prayer or protestation as it -isaia- called , to Our most loving Savior , set_forth in the same words according to the copy subjoined to this_letter shall be solemnly recited , so that all our faults may be washed away with tears , and reparation may be made for the violated rights of Christ the supreme King and Our most loving Lord . There -isaia- surely no reason_for doubting , Venerable Brethren , that_from this_devotion piously established and commanded to the whole Church , many excellent benefits will flow forth not_only to individual men but_also to society , sacred , civil , and domestic , seeing that_our Redeemer Himself promised to Margaret Mary that '' all those_who rendered this honor to His Heart would be endowed_with an abundance of heavenly graces . '' Sinners indeed , looking on Him whom_they pierced John xix , , moved by the sighs and tears of the whole Church , by grieving for the injuries offered to the supreme King , will return to the heart Isaias xlvi , , lest perchance being hardened in their faults , when_they see Him whom_they pierced '' coming in the clouds of heaven '' Matth . xxvi , , too late and in vain they_shall bewail themselves because of Him Cf . But the just shall be justified and shall be sanctified still Cf . and they_will devote_themselves wholly and with new ardor to the service of their King , when_they see Him contemned and attacked and assailed with so many and such_great insults , but more_than all will they burn with zeal for the eternal salvation_of_souls when they_have pondered on the complaint of the Divine Victim : '' What profit -isaia- there in my blood ? '' Psalm xxix , , and likewise on the joy that_will be felt by the same Most Sacred Heart of Jesus '' upon one sinner doing penance '' Luke xv , . And this indeed we more especially and vehemently desire and confidently expect , that the just and merciful God who would_have spared Sodom for the sake of ten just men , will much_more be ready to spare the whole race of men , when He -isaia- moved by the humble petitions and happily appeased by the prayers of the community of the faithful praying together in union with Christ their Mediator and Head , in the name of all . And now lastly may the most benign Virgin Mother of God smile on this_purpose and on these desires of ours ; for since she brought forth for us Jesus our Redeemer , and nourished Him , and offered Him as a victim by the Cross , by her mystic union with Christ and His very_special grace she likewise became and -isaia- piously called a reparatress . Trusting in her intercession with Christ , who whereas He -isaia- the '' one mediator of God and men '' Timothy ii , , chose to make His Mother the advocate of sinners , and the minister and mediatress of grace , as an earnest of heavenly_gifts and as a token of Our paternal affection we most lovingly impart the Apostolic Blessing to you , Venerable Brethren , and to all the flock committed to your_care . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St . Peter s , on the eighth day of May , , in the seventh year of Our Pontificate . Prayer of Reparation O sweetest Jesus , whose overflowing charity towards men -isaia- most ungratefully repaid by such_great forgetfulness , neglect and contempt , see , prostrate before Thy altars , we strive by special honor to make amends for the wicked coldness of men and the contumely with_which Thy most loving Heart -isaia- everywhere treated . At the same_time , mindful of the fact_that we too have sometimes not_been free_from unworthiness , and moved therefore with most vehement sorrow , in the first_place we implore Thy mercy on us , being prepared by voluntary expiation to make amends for the sins we have ourselves committed , and also_for the sins of those_who wander far from the way of salvation , whether because , being obstinate in their unbelief , they refuse to follow Thee as their shepherd and leader , or because , spurning the promises of their Baptism , they_have cast off the most sweet yoke of Thy law . We now endeavor to expiate all these lamentable crimes together , and it -isaia-_also our purpose to make amends for each_one of them severally : for the want of modesty in life and dress , for impurities , for so many snares set for the minds of the innocent , for the violation of feast days , for the horrid blasphemies against Thee and Thy saints , for the insults offered to Thy Vicar and to the priestly order , for the neglect of the Sacrament of Divine love or its profanation by horrible sacrileges , and lastly for the public sins of nations which resist the rights and the teaching_authority of the Church which Thou hast instituted . Would that we could wash away these crimes with_our own blood ! And now , to make amends for the outrage offered to the Divine honor , we offer to Thee the same satisfaction which Thou didst once offer to Thy Father on the Cross and which Thou dost continually renew on our altars , we offer this conjoined with the expiations of the Virgin Mother and of all the Saints , and of all pious Christians , promising from our_heart that so far as in us lies , with the help of Thy grace , we will_make amends for our_own past sins , and for the sins of others , and for the neglect of Thy boundless love , by firm faith , by a pure way_of_life , and by a perfect observance of the Gospel law , especially that of charity ; we will_also strive with_all_our strength to prevent injuries being offered to Thee , and gather as many as we can to become Thy followers . Receive , we beseech Thee , O most benign Jesus , by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the Reparatress , the voluntary homage of this expiation , and vouchsafe , by that great gift of final perseverance , to keep us most faithful until death in our_duty and in Thy service , so that -atti_degli_apostoli- length we may all come to that fatherland , where Thou with the Father and the Holy Ghost livest and reignest God for ever and ever .
