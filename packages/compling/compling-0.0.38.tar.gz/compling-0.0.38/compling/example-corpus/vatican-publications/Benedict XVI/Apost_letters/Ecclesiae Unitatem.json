The duty to safeguard the unity of the Church with concern to offer help to all in order to respond appropriately to this vocation and divine_grace -isaia- incumbent in particular on the Successor of the Apostle Peter , who_-isaia- the perpetual and visible principle and foundation of the unity both of the Bishops and of the faithful cf . Second Vatican Council , Dogmatic Constitution on the Church , Lumen Gentium , n . ; First Ecumenical Vatican Council , Dogmatic Constitution on the Church of Christ Pastor Aeternus , chap . The supreme and fundamental priority of the Church in every epoch to lead humankind to the encounter_with God must be encouraged by the commitment to achieve a witness of faith common to all Christians . In fidelity to this mandate , subsequent to the act of June with_which Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre illicitly conferred episcopal ordination upon four priests , on July Pope John Paul II of venerable memory established the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei : '' whose task it will be to collaborate with the Bishops , with the Departments of the Roman Curia and with the circles concerned , for the purpose of facilitating the full ecclesial_communion of priests , seminarians , religious communities or individual religious until now linked in various_ways to the Society founded by Archbishop Lefebvre , who may wish to remain united to the Successor of Peter in the Catholic Church , while preserving their_spiritual and liturgical traditions , in the light of the Protocol signed on May last by Cardinal Ratzinger and Archbishop Lefebvre '' John Paul II , Litterae Apostolicae Motu Proprio datae Ecclesia Dei July , n . Along these lines , adhering faithfully to the same duty to serve the universal communion of the Church also in its visible manifestation and making every_effort to ensure_that all who truly desire unity have_the possibility of remaining in it or of rediscovering it , with the Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum I desired to extend and to update , by means of more precise and detailed norms , the general instructions already contained in the Motu Proprio Ecclesia Dei concerning the possibility of using the Missale Romanum Benedict XVI , Litt . Moto Proprio datae Summorum Pontificum July : , . In the same_spirit and with the same commitment to encouraging the resolution of all fractures and divisions in the Church and to healing a wound in the ecclesial fabric that_was more_and_more painfully felt , I wished to remit the excommunication of the four Bishops illicitly ordained by Archbishop Lefebvre . With this decision I intended to remove an impediment that might have jeopardized the opening of a door to dialogue and thereby to invite the Bishops and the '' Society of St Pius X '' to rediscover the path to full_communion with the Church . As I explained in my Letter to the Catholic Bishops of last March , the remission of the excommunication was a measure taken in the context of ecclesiastical discipline to free the individuals from the burden of conscience constituted by the most serious of ecclesiastical penalties . However , the doctrinal questions obviously remain and until they_are clarified the Society has no canonical status in the Church and its ministers cannot legitimately exercise any ministry . Precisely because the problems that_must now be addressed with the Society are essentially doctrinal in nature , I have decided years after_the Motu Proprio Ecclesia Dei and in conformity_with what I had proposed cf . to rethink the structure of the Commission Ecclesia Dei , linking it closely to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . The Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei will therefore have_the following configuration : a The President of the Commission -isaia- the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . b The Commission , with its_own allocation of staff , -isaia- composed of the Secretary and officials . c The task of the Cardinal President , assisted by the Secretary , -isaia- to refer the principal cases and doctrinal questions to the judgment of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith through its ordinary procedures , and to submit the results thereof to the superior dispositions of the Supreme Pontiff . With this decision I have wished in particular to show fatherly solicitude to the '' Society of St Pius X '' in order_that it rediscover full_communion with the Church . I address to all a pressing invitation to pray the Lord tirelessly , through the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary , '' ut unum sint '' .
