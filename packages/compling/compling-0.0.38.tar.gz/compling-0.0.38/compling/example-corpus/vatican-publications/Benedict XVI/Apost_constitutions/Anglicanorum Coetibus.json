The Apostolic See has responded favourably to such petitions . Indeed , the successor of Peter , mandated by the Lord Jesus to guarantee the unity of the episcopate and to preside over and safeguard the universal communion of all the Churches , could_not fail to make available the means necessary to bring this_holy desire to realization . The Church , a people gathered into the unity of the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit , was instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ , as '' a sacrament \u2013 a sign and instrument , that_-isaia- , of communion with God and of unity among all people . '' Every division among the baptized in Jesus Christ wounds that_which the Church -isaia- and that for_which the Church exists ; in fact , '' such division openly contradicts the will of Christ , scandalizes the world , and damages that most_holy cause , the preaching the Gospel to every_creature . '' Precisely for this_reason , before shedding his_blood for the salvation of the world , the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father for the unity of his_disciples . It -isaia- the Holy Spirit , the principle of unity , which establishes the Church as a communion . He -isaia- the principle of the unity of the faithful in the teaching of the Apostles , in the breaking of the bread and in prayer . The Church , however , analogous to the mystery of the Incarnate Word , -isaia-_not_only an invisible spiritual communion , but -isaia-_also visible ; in fact , '' the society structured with hierarchical organs and the Mystical Body of Christ , the visible society and the spiritual community , the earthly Church and the Church endowed_with heavenly riches , are_not to be thought of as two realities . On the contrary , they form one complex reality formed from a two fold element , human and divine . '' The communion of the baptized in the teaching of the Apostles and in the breaking of the eucharistic bread -isaia- visibly manifested in the bonds of the profession of the faith in its entirety , of the celebration of all of the sacraments instituted by Christ , and of the governance of the College of Bishops united with its head , the Roman Pontiff . This single Church of Christ , which we profess in the Creed as one , holy , catholic and apostolic '' subsists in the Catholic Church , which_-isaia- governed by the successor of Peter and by the Bishops in communion with_him . Nevertheless , many elements of sanctification and of truth are_found outside her visible confines . Since these_are gifts properly belonging to the Church of Christ , they_are forces impelling towards Catholic unity . '' In the light of these ecclesiological principles , this Apostolic Constitution provides the general normative structure for regulating the institution and life of Personal Ordinariates for those Anglican faithful_who desire to enter_into the full_communion of the Catholic Church in a corporate manner . This Constitution -isaia- completed by Complementary Norms issued by the Apostolic See . Personal Ordinariates for Anglicans entering into full_communion with the Catholic Church are erected by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith within_the confines of the territorial boundaries of a particular Conference of Bishops in consultation with that_same Conference . Within the territory of a particular Conference of Bishops , one or more Ordinariates may be erected as needed . Each Ordinariate possesses public juridic personality by the law itself ipso iure ; it -isaia- juridically comparable to a diocese . The Ordinariate -isaia- composed of lay_faithful , clerics and members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life , originally belonging to the Anglican Communion and now in full_communion with the Catholic Church , or those_who receive the Sacraments of Initiation within_the jurisdiction of the Ordinariate . The Catechism of the Catholic Church -isaia- the authoritative expression of the Catholic faith professed by members of the Ordinariate . The Personal Ordinariate -isaia- governed according to the norms of universal law and the present Apostolic Constitution and -isaia- subject to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , and the other Dicasteries of the Roman Curia in accordance_with their competencies . It -isaia-_also governed by the Complementary Norms as well as any_other specific Norms given for each Ordinariate . Without excluding liturgical celebrations according to the Roman Rite , the Ordinariate has the faculty to celebrate the Holy Eucharist and the other Sacraments , the Liturgy of the Hours and other liturgical celebrations according to the liturgical books proper to the Anglican tradition , which_have_been approved by the Holy See , so as to maintain the liturgical , spiritual and pastoral traditions of the Anglican Communion within_the Catholic Church , as a precious gift nourishing the faith of the members of the Ordinariate and as a treasure to be shared . A Personal Ordinariate -isaia- entrusted to the pastoral_care of an Ordinary appointed by the Roman Pontiff . The power potestas of the Ordinary -isaia- : a . ordinary : connected by the law itself to the office entrusted to him by the Roman Pontiff , for both the internal forum and external forum ; b . vicarious : exercised in the name of the Roman Pontiff ; c . personal : exercised over all who belong to the Ordinariate ; This power -isaia- to be exercised jointly with_that of the local Diocesan Bishop , in those cases provided for in the Complementary Norms . Those who ministered as Anglican deacons , priests , or bishops , and who fulfil the requisites established by canon_law and are_not impeded by irregularities or other impediments may be accepted by the Ordinary as candidates_for Holy Orders in the Catholic Church . In the case of married ministers , the norms established in the Encyclical Letter of Pope Paul VI Sacerdotalis coelibatus , n . and in the Statement In June are to be observed . Unmarried ministers must submit to the norm of clerical celibacy of can . The Ordinary , in full observance of the discipline of celibate clergy in the Latin Church , as a rule pro regula will admit only celibate men to the order of presbyter . He may also petition the Roman Pontiff , as a derogation from can . , , for the admission of married men to the order of presbyter on a case by case basis , according to objective criteria approved by the Holy See . Incardination of clerics will be regulated according to the norms of canon_law . Priests incardinated into an Ordinariate , who constitute the presbyterate of the Ordinariate , are_also to cultivate bonds of unity with the presbyterate of the Diocese in which_they exercise their_ministry . They should promote common pastoral and charitable initiatives and activities , which_can be the object of agreements between_the Ordinary and the local Diocesan Bishop . Candidates for Holy Orders in an Ordinariate should be prepared alongside other seminarians , especially in the areas of doctrinal and pastoral formation . In order to address the particular needs of seminarians of the Ordinariate and formation in Anglican patrimony , the Ordinary may also establish seminary programs or houses of formation which_would relate to existing Catholic faculties of theology . The Ordinary , with the approval of the Holy See , can erect new Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life , with the right to call their members to Holy Orders , according to the norms of canon_law . Institutes of Consecrated Life originating in the Anglican Communion and entering into full_communion with the Catholic Church may also be placed under his jurisdiction by mutual consent . The Ordinary , according to the norm of law , after_having heard the opinion of the Diocesan Bishop of the place , may erect , with the consent of the Holy See , personal parishes for the faithful_who belong to the Ordinariate . Pastors of the Ordinariate enjoy all the rights and are held to all the obligations established in the Code of Canon Law and , in cases established by the Complementary Norms , such rights and obligations are to be exercised in mutual pastoral assistance together_with_the pastors of the local Diocese where_the personal parish of the Ordinariate has_been established . Both the lay_faithful as well as members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life , originally part of the Anglican Communion , who wish to enter_the Personal Ordinariate , must manifest this desire in writing . The Ordinary -isaia- aided in his governance by a Governing Council with its_own statutes approved by the Ordinary and confirmed by the Holy See . The Governing Council , presided over by the Ordinary , -isaia- composed of -atti_degli_apostoli- least six priests . It exercises the functions specified in the Code of Canon Law for the Presbyteral Council and the College of Consultors , as well as those areas specified in the Complementary Norms . The Ordinary -isaia- to establish a Finance Council according to the norms established by the Code of Canon Law which_will exercise the duties specified therein . In order to provide_for the consultation of the faithful , a Pastoral Council -isaia- to be constituted in the Ordinariate . Every five years the Ordinary -isaia- required to come to Rome for an ad limina Apostolorum visit and present to the Roman Pontiff , through the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and in consultation with the Congregation for Bishops and the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples , a report on the status of the Ordinariate . For judicial cases , the competent tribunal -isaia- that of the Diocese in which one of the parties -isaia- domiciled , unless the Ordinariate has constituted its_own tribunal , in which case the tribunal of second instance -isaia-_the_one designated by the Ordinariate and approved by the Holy See . In both cases , the different titles of competence established by the Code of Canon Law are to be taken into_account . The Decree establishing an Ordinariate will determine the location of the See and , if appropriate , the principal church . We desire_that our dispositions and norms be valid and effective now and in the future , notwithstanding , should it be necessary , the Apostolic Constitutions and ordinances issued by our_predecessors , or any_other prescriptions , even_those requiring special mention or derogation .
