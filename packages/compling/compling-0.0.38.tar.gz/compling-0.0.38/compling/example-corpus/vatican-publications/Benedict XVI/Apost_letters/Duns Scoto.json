Our Venerable Predecessors , the Servants of God Paul VI and John Paul II , exalted him_with lofty praise ; we too would_like to surround him_with the praise he deserves and invoke his protection . Thus the seventh centenary of his pious passing -isaia-_now being celebrated , as -isaia- only right . And while articles and entire works in honour of Bl . John Duns Scotus are_being published in various parts_of_the_world and congresses are_being held , including the solemn Congress currently being prepared that_will take_place in Cologne from to November , we consider it a duty of our service in this circumstance to say a few words about_this most illustrious man_who so distinguished himself by contributing to the progress of the doctrine of the Church and of human science . Indeed , combining piety with scientific_research , in accordance_with his invocation : '' May the First Principle of things grant me to believe , to understand and to reveal what may please his majesty and may raise our minds to contemplate him '' , with_his refined brilliance he penetrated so deeply the secrets of natural and revealed_truth , and found in them a doctrine which led him to be called Doctor Ordinis , Doctor Subtilis , and Doctor Marianus , becoming a teacher and guide of the Franciscan School , a light and example to the entire Christian People . Thus we desire to remind scholars and everyone , believers and non believers alike , of the path and method that Scotus followed in order to establish harmony between_faith and reason , defining in this manner the nature of theology in order constantly to exalt action , influence , practice and love rather_than pure speculation ; in fulfilling this_task he let himself be guided by the Magisterium of the Church and by a sound critical sense regarding growth in knowledge of the truth and was convinced_that knowledge -isaia- valuable to the extent that_it_-isaia- applied in praxis . Firmly anchored to the Catholic faith , Duns Scotus strove to understand , explain and defend the truth of the faith in the light of human_reason . Thus he strove to do nothing other_than show the consonance of all truths , natural and supernatural , that come from one_and_the_same Source . Alongside Sacred Scripture , divinely inspired , -isaia- the authority of the Church . Duns Scotus seems to follow St Augustine s words : '' I would_not believe the Gospel , except that I first believe the Catholic Church '' . In fact , our Doctor often gives a special emphasis to the supreme_authority of the Successor of Peter . As the Blessed said : '' Although the Pope cannot dispense with natural and divine_law given that his_power -isaia- inferior to both , being the Successor of Peter , Prince of the Apostles , he still has the same authority as had Peter '' . Therefore , the Catholic Church whose invisible Head -isaia- Christ himself , who left as his Vicars the person of Blessed Peter and his Successors guided by the Spirit of truth , -isaia- the authentic custodian of the revealed deposit and the rule of faith . The Church -isaia- the firm and permanent criterion of the canonical dimension of Sacred Scripture . Indeed , she '' established which books of the biblical canon were to be held authentic '' . Elsewhere he states that '' the Scriptures were revealed in the same Spirit in which_they were written , and in this_way one_must consider that the Catholic Church has presented them in that_same Spirit with_which_the faith_has been passed down , guided that_-isaia- , by the Spirit of truth '' . After having proven with various arguments taken from theological reason , the very fact_that the Blessed Virgin Mary was preserved from original_sin , he was absolutely ready also to reject this conviction should it not be in harmony_with_the authority of the Church , saying : '' We can with probability attribute to Mary all that_has the greatest perfection , provided it -isaia- not opposed to the authority of the Church or the Scriptures '' . The primacy of the will sheds light on the fact_that God -isaia- charity before all else . This charity , this_love , Duns Scotus kept present when he sought to lead theology back to a single expression , that_-isaia- to practical theology . According to his thought , since God '' -isaia- formally love and formally charity '' , with the greatest generosity he radiates his goodness and love beyond himself . And in reality , it -isaia- for love_that God '' chose us in him before the foundation of the world , that_we_should be holy and blameless before him . He predestined us in love to be his adoptive sons through Jesus Christ '' cf . A faithful disciple of St Francis of Assisi , Bl . John contemplated and preached assiduously the Incarnation and the saving Passion of the Son of God . However , the charity or love of Christ -isaia- expressed in a special_way not_only on Calvary , but_also in the most_holy Sacrament of the Eucharist , without_which '' if not_for being able to render supreme adoration unto God through the veneration of the same Sacrament every mercy would disappear in the Church '' . This Sacrament moreover -isaia- a sacrament of unity and love ; through it we are led to love one_another mutually and to love God as a common_good and to be loved -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time by others . And as this_love , this charity , was_the origin of all things , so too our eternal happiness will be in love and charity alone : '' Eternal life_-isaia- simply the desire as well as the will to love , blessed and perfect '' . Since -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of our ministry we first of all preached love , which_-isaia- God himself , we see with_joy that the unique doctrine of this Blessed keeps a special place_for this_truth , which we consider principally worthy to be researched and taught in our_time . Therefore , willingly complying with the request of our Venerable Brother Cardinal Joachim Meisner , of Holy Roman Church , Archbishop of Cologne , we are sending this Apostolic Letter with_which we desire to honour Bl . John Duns Scotus and invoke his heavenly intercession upon us . Lastly , to those_who_are taking part in any capacity in this International Congress and in other initiatives concerning this outstanding son of St Francis , we cordially impart our Apostolic Blessing . Given in Rome , -atti_degli_apostoli- St Peter s on October , the fourth year_of_our Pontificate . XVI Notes Duns Scotus , Tractatus de primo Principio , c . , Tractatus de primo Principio , c .
