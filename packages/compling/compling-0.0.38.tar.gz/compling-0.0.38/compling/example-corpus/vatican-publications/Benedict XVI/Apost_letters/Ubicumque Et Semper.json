He , the first and supreme evangelizer , commanded the Apostles on the day of his Ascension to the Father : '' Go therefore and make disciples of all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit , teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you '' Mt : . Faithful to this mandate , the Church a people chosen by God to declare his wonderful deeds cf . Peter : ever since she received_the gift of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost cf . Acts : , has_never tired of making known to the whole_world the beauty of the Gospel as she preaches Jesus Christ , true God and true man , the same '' yesterday and today and for ever '' Heb : , who , by his_death and Resurrection , brought us salvation and fulfilled the promise made of old . Hence the mission of evangelization , a continuation of the work desired by the Lord Jesus , -isaia- necessary_for the Church : it cannot be overlooked ; it -isaia- an expression of her very nature . In the course of history , this_mission has_taken on new_forms and employed new strategies according to different places , situations , and historical periods . In our own_time , it has_been particularly challenged by an abandonment of the faith a phenomenon progressively more manifest in societies and cultures which for centuries seemed to be permeated by the Gospel . The social changes we have witnessed in recent decades have a long and complex history , and they_have profoundly altered our way of looking -atti_degli_apostoli- the world . We need only think of the many advances in science and technology , the expanding possibilities with_regard to life and individual freedom , the profound changes in the economic sphere , and the mixing of races and cultures caused by global scale migration and an increasing interdependence of peoples . All of this_has not_been without consequences on the religious dimension of human_life as well . If on the one_hand humanity has derived undeniable benefits from_these changes , and the Church has drawn_from them further incentives for bearing_witness to the hope that_-isaia- within her cf . Pt : , on the other_hand there_has been a troubling loss of the sense of the sacred , which_has even called into question foundations once deemed unshakeable such as faith in a provident creator God , the revelation of Jesus Christ as the one Saviour , and a common understanding of basic human experiences : i . , birth , death , life in a family , and reference to a natural moral_law . Even though some consider these_things a kind of liberation , there soon follows an awareness_that an interior desert results whenever the human_being , wishing to be the sole architect of his nature and destiny , finds himself deprived of that_which_-isaia- the very foundation of all things . The Second Vatican Council already included among its central topics the question of the relationship_between_the Church and the modern_world . In view of this conciliar teaching , my Predecessors reflected further on the need to find adequate ways to help the people of our_time to hear_the living and eternal Word of the Lord . With foresight , the Servant of God Paul VI noted_that the task of evangelization , '' as a result of the frequent situations of dechristianization in our_day , also proves equally necessary_for innumerable people who_have_been baptized but who_live quite outside Christian life , for simple people_who have a certain faith but an imperfect knowledge of the foundations of that_faith , for intellectuals who feel the need to know Jesus Christ in a light different from the instruction they received as children , and for many_others '' Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Nuntiandi , n . Moreover , having in mind those distant from the faith , he added that the evangelizing action of the Church '' must constantly seek the proper means and language for presenting , or representing , to them God s revelation and faith in Jesus Christ '' ibid . The Venerable Servant of God John Paul II made this urgent task a central point of his far reaching Magisterial teaching , referring to it as the '' new_evangelization , '' which he systematically explored in depth on numerous occasions a task that still bears upon the Church today , particularly in regions Christianized long ago . Although this_task directly concerns the Church s way of relating ad extra , it nevertheless presupposes first of all a constant interior renewal , a continuous passing , so to speak , from evangelized to evangelizing . It -isaia- enough to recall what_was affirmed in the Post Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Christifideles Laici : '' Whole countries and nations where religion and the Christian life were formerly flourishing and capable of fostering a viable and working community of faith , are_now put to a hard test , and in some cases , are even undergoing a radical transformation , as a result of a constant spreading of an indifference to religion , of secularism and atheism . This particularly concerns countries and nations of the so called First World , in which economic well_being and consumerism , even if coexistent with a tragic situation of poverty and misery , inspires and sustains a life lived as if God did not_exist . This indifference to religion and the practice of religion devoid of true meaning in the face of life s very serious problems , are_not less worrying and upsetting when compared with declared atheism . Sometimes the Christian faith as well , while maintaining some of the externals of its tradition and rituals , tends to be separated_from those moments of human_existence which_have the most significance , such as , birth , suffering and death . '' On the other_hand , in other regions or nations many vital traditions of piety and popular forms of Christian religion are_still conserved ; but today this moral and spiritual patrimony runs the risk of being dispersed under the impact of a multiplicity of processes , including secularization and the spread of sects . Only a re evangelization can assure the growth of a clear and deep faith , and serve to make these traditions a force for authentic freedom . '' Without doubt a mending of the Christian fabric of society_-isaia- urgently needed in all parts_of_the_world . But for_this to come about what_-isaia- needed -isaia- to first remake the Christian fabric of the ecclesial_community itself present in these countries and nations '' n . Making my own the concerns of my venerable Predecessors , I consider it opportune to offer appropriate responses so that the entire Church , allowing herself to be regenerated by the power of the Holy Spirit , may present herself to the contemporary world with a missionary impulse in order to promote the new_evangelization . Above all , this pertains to Churches of ancient origin , which live in different situations and have different needs , and therefore require different types of motivation for evangelization : in certain territories , in fact , despite the spread of secularization , Christian practice still thrives and shows itself deeply rooted in the soul of entire populations ; in other regions , however , there_-isaia- a clearly a distancing of society from the faith in every respect , together_with a weaker ecclesial fabric , even if not_without elements of liveliness that the Spirit never fails to awaken ; we also sadly know of some areas that_have almost completely abandoned the Christian religion , where_the light of the faith_-isaia- entrusted to the witness of small communities : these lands , which need a renewed first proclamation of the Gospel , seem particularly resistant to many aspects of the Christian message . This variety of situations demands careful discernment ; to speak of a '' new_evangelization '' does_not in fact mean_that a single formula should be developed that_would hold the same for all circumstances . And yet it -isaia- not difficult to see that_what all the Churches living in traditionally Christian territories need -isaia- a renewed missionary impulse , an expression of a new , generous openness to the gift of grace . Indeed we cannot forget_that the first task will_always be to make ourselves docile to the freely given action of the Spirit of the Risen One who accompanies all who_are heralds of the Gospel and opens the hearts of those_who listen . To proclaim fruitfully the Word of the Gospel one_-isaia- first asked to have a profound experience of God . As I stated in my first Encyclical Deus Caritas Est : '' Being Christian -isaia- not the result of an ethical choice or a lofty idea , but the encounter_with an event , a person , which_gives life a new horizon and a decisive direction '' n . Likewise , -atti_degli_apostoli- the root of all evangelization lies not a human plan of expansion , but_rather the desire to share the inestimable gift that God has wished to give us , making us sharers in his own_life . Therefore , in the light of these reflections , having examined everything carefully and having elicited the opinions of experts , I establish and decree the following : Art . The Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization -isaia- established as a Dicastery of the Roman Curia in compliance with the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus . The Council pursues its_own ends both by encouraging reflection on topics of the new_evangelization , and by identifying and promoting suitable ways and means to accomplish it . The action of the Council , which_-isaia- carried_out in collaboration with the other Dicasteries and Organisms of the Roman Curia , with_respect for their relative competencies , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the particular Churches , especially in those territories of Christian tradition where_the phenomenon of secularization -isaia- more obviously apparent . Among the specific tasks of the Council are particularly the following : . to examine in depth the theological and pastoral meaning of the new_evangelization ; . to promote and to foster , in close collaboration with the Bishops Conferences concerned which_may establish ad hoc organisms the study , dissemination , and implementation of the Papal Magisterium related to topics connected_with_the new_evangelization ; . to make known and to support initiatives linked to the new_evangelization that are_already being put into_practice in various particular Churches , and to promote the realization of new projects by actively involving the resources present in Institutes of Consecrated Life and in Societies of Apostolic Life , as well as in groups of the faithful and in new communities ; . to study and to encourage the use of modern forms of communication as instruments for the new_evangelization ; . to promote the use of the Catechism of the Catholic Church as an essential and complete formulation of the content of the faith for the people of our_time . The Council -isaia-_directed by an Archbishop President , assisted by a Secretary , by an Under Secretary and by an appropriate number of Officials , in accordance_with_the norms established by the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus and by the General Regulations of the Roman Curia . The Council will_have its_own Members and may avail itself of its_own Consultors . I order_that all that_has_been established by this Motu Proprio may_have full and permanent value , notwithstanding anything to the contrary , even if it be worthy of particular mention , and I establish that it be promulgated through publication in the daily newspaper L Osservatore Romano and that it come into force on the day of its promulgation . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Castel Gandolfo on the st day of September , the Feast of Saint Matthew , Apostle and Evangelist , the sixth year of my Pontificate .
