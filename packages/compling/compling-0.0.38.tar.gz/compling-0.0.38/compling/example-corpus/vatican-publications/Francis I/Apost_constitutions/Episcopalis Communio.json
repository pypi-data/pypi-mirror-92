Episcopal communion episcopalis communio , with and under Peter , -isaia- manifested in a particular_way in the Synod of Bishops . Instituted by Paul VI on September , the Synod of Bishops -isaia- one_of_the_most precious fruits of the Second Vatican Council . Ever since then , the Synod \u2013 new as an institution but ancient in its inspiration \u2013 has provided an effective support to the Roman Pontiff , through channels that he himself established , in matters of greater importance ; that_-isaia- to say , those requiring special knowledge and judgment for the good of the whole Church . In this_way the Synod of Bishops , '' representing the entire Catholic episcopate , demonstrates the fact_that all the Bishops are in hierarchical communion in solicitude for the universal Church '' . For over fifty years , the Synod Assemblies have proved a valuable instrument of shared knowledge among the Bishops , of common prayer , honest exchange , deepening of Christian doctrine , reform of ecclesiastical structures and promotion of pastoral_activity throughout_the_world . In this_way , not_only have these Assemblies served as a privileged locus of interpretation and reception of the rich conciliar Magisterium , but_they have_also given a significant impetus to subsequent papal Magisterium . Today , too , -atti_degli_apostoli- a point in history when_the Church -isaia- embarking upon a '' new chapter of evangelization '' requiring her to be '' throughout_the_world . permanently in a state of mission '' , the Synod of Bishops -isaia- called , like every_other ecclesiastical institution , to become ever_more '' suitably channelled for the evangelization of today_s_world rather_than for_her self preservation '' . Above all , recognizing that '' the task of proclaiming the Gospel everywhere in the world falls primarily on the body of Bishops '' , the Synod needs , in the words of the Council , to '' give special consideration to missionary_activity , which_-isaia- the greatest and holiest task of the Church '' . It -isaia- providential that the Synod of Bishops was instituted in the context of the last Ecumenical Council . In fact , the Second Vatican Council , following in the footsteps of the First Vatican Council , deepened the doctrine of the episcopate within_the authentic ecclesiastical Tradition , focusing particularly on its sacramentality and its collegial nature . It emerged very clearly that_each Bishop possesses simultaneously and inseparably responsibility_for the particular Church assigned to his pastoral_care and solicitude for the universal Church . This solicitude , which expresses the supra diocesan dimension of the episcopal munus , -isaia- exercised in solemn form in an Ecumenical Council and -isaia-_also expressed in the united action of Bishops dispersed throughout_the_world , when this action -isaia- proclaimed as such or freely accepted by the Roman Pontiff . It must be remembered that it pertains to him , according to the needs of the People of God , to select and promote ways in which_the College of Bishops can exercise its_proper authority over the universal Church . In the course of the conciliar discussions , alongside the doctrine on episcopal collegiality , the request also emerged several times for some Bishops to be associated_with the universal ministry of the Roman Pontiff via a permanent central body , distinct from the dicasteries of the Roman Curia ; it was hoped that_this body , beyond_the solemn and extraordinary form of the Ecumenical Council , would manifest the solicitude of the College of Bishops for the needs of the People of God and for communion among all the Churches . On September , in response to these requests , Paul VI announced to the Council Fathers , gathered for the opening of the fourth session of the Ecumenical Council , the decision , taken on his_own initiative and by his_own power , to institute a body known as the Synod of Bishops . This body '' composed of Bishops , appointed for the most part by the Episcopal Conferences , with_our approval , will be summoned by the Roman Pontiff , according to the needs of the Church , for consultation and collaboration when , for the general good of the Church , he deems it opportune '' . In the Motu Proprio Apostolica Sollicitudo , promulgated the following day , Paul VI instituted the Synod of Bishops , '' whereby Bishops chosen from various parts_of_the_world are to offer more_effective assistance to the supreme Pastor of the Church '' . The Synod would be '' constituted in such_a_way_that it -isaia- a central ecclesiastical institution ; representing the whole Catholic episcopate ; of its_nature perpetual ; as for structure , carrying_out its function for a time and when called_upon '' . The Synod of Bishops , whose name evokes the Church s ancient and very rich synodal tradition , held in particular esteem by the Eastern Churches , would normally exercise a consultative role , offering information and counsel to the Roman Pontiff on various ecclesial questions , under_the_guidance of the Holy Spirit . At the same_time , the Synod might also enjoy deliberative power , should the Roman Pontiff wish to grant this . When instituting the Synod as a '' special permanent council of sacred Pastors '' , Paul VI knew that '' like every_human institution , it could be further improved with the passage of time '' . Its later development has_been fed on the one_hand by ongoing reception of the fruitful conciliar teaching on episcopal collegiality and on the other_hand by the experience of the numerous Synodal Assemblies held in Rome since , when_the Ordo Synodi Episcoporum was first published . Likewise , after_the promulgation of the Code of Canon Law and the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches , which made the Synod of Bishops part of universal law , the Synod continued to gradually evolve , until the latest edition of the Ordo Synodi was promulgated by Benedict XVI on September . In particular , the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops , consisting of the General Secretary and a special Council of Bishops , was instituted and gradually strengthened in its_proper functions , so that the structural stability of the Synod might be better maintained during the periods between_the various Synodal Assemblies . In these years , noting the effectiveness of synodal action vis \u00e0 vis questions that require timely and united intervention from the Church s Pastors , there_has been a growing wish for the Synod to become more_and_more a specific manifestation and effective implementation of the solicitude of the episcopate for all the Churches . John Paul II stated_that '' perhaps this instrument can be further improved . Perhaps the collegial pastoral responsibility can be expressed in the Synod even more_fully '' . For these reasons , since_the beginning of my Petrine ministry , I have paid special_attention to the Synod of Bishops , confident that it can experience '' further development so as to do even_more to promote dialogue and cooperation among Bishops themselves and between_them and the Bishop of Rome '' . Underpinning this_work of renewal must be the firm conviction_that all Bishops are appointed for the service of the holy People of God , to whom they_themselves belong through the sacrament of Baptism . It -isaia- certainly true , as the Second Vatican Council teaches , that '' when Bishops engage in teaching , in communion with the Roman Pontiff , they deserve respect from all , as the witnesses of divine and catholic truth ; the faithful must agree with the judgment of their Bishop on faith_and_morals , which he delivers in the name of Christ ; they_must give it their adherence with religious assent of the mind '' . But it -isaia-_also true_that '' for_every Bishop the life of the Church and life in the Church -isaia- the condition_for exercising his_mission to teach '' . Hence the Bishop -isaia- both teacher and disciple . He -isaia- a teacher when , endowed_with the special assistance of the Holy Spirit , he proclaims to the faithful the word of truth in the name of Christ , head and shepherd . But he -isaia- a disciple when , knowing that the Spirit has_been bestowed upon every baptized person , he listens to the voice of Christ speaking through the entire People of God , making it '' infallible in credendo '' . Indeed , '' the universal body made up of the faithful , whom_the Holy One has anointed cf . Jn : , , -isaia- incapable of erring in belief . This -isaia- a property which belongs to the people as a whole ; a supernatural sense of faith_-isaia- the means by which_they make_this property manifest , when from Bishops to the last of the lay_faithful , they show universal agreement in matters of faith_and_morals '' . So the Bishop -isaia- called to lead his flock by '' walking in front of them , showing them the way , showing them the path ; walking in their midst , to strengthen them in unity ; walking behind them , to make sure no one gets left behind but especially , never to lose the scent of the People of God in order to find new roads . A Bishop who lives among his faithful has his ears open to listen to what_the Spirit says to the churches Rev : , and to the voice of the sheep , also through those diocesan institutions whose task it -isaia- to advise the Bishop , promoting a loyal and constructive dialogue '' . Similarly , the Synod of Bishops must increasingly become a privileged instrument for listening to the People of God : '' For the Synod Fathers we ask the Holy Spirit first of all for the gift of listening : to listen to God , that_with him we may hear_the cry of the people ; to listen to the people until breathing in the desire to which God calls us '' . Although structurally it -isaia- essentially configured as an episcopal body , this does_not_mean that the Synod exists separately from the rest of the faithful . On the contrary , it -isaia- a suitable instrument to give voice to the entire People of God , specifically via the Bishops , established by God as '' authentic guardians , interpreters and witnesses of the faith of the whole Church '' , demonstrating , from one Assembly to another , that_it_-isaia- an eloquent expression of synodality as a '' constitutive element of the Church '' . Therefore , as John Paul II declared , '' Every General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops -isaia- a powerful ecclesial experience , even if some of its practical procedures can always be perfected . The Bishops assembled in Synod represent in the first_place their_own Churches , but_they are_also attentive to the contributions of the Episcopal Conferences which selected them and whose views about questions under discussion they then communicate . They thus express the recommendation of the entire hierarchical body of the Church and finally , in a certain_sense , the whole Christian people , whose pastors they_are '' . The history of the Church bears ample witness to the importance of consultation for ascertaining the views of the Bishops and the faithful in matters pertaining to the good of the Church . Hence , even in the preparation of Synodal Assemblies , it -isaia-_very important_that consultation of all the particular Churches be given special_attention . In this initial phase , following the indications of the General Secretariat of the Synod , the Bishops submit the questions to be explored in the Synodal Assembly to the priests , deacons and lay_faithful of their Churches , both individually and in associations , without overlooking the valuable contribution that consecrated men_and_women can_offer . Above all , the contribution of the local Church s participatory bodies , especially_the Presbyteral Council and the Pastoral Council , can prove fundamental , and from here '' a synodal Church can begin to emerge '' . During every Synodal Assembly , consultation of the faithful must be followed by discernment on the part of the Bishops chosen for the task , united in the search_for a consensus that springs not from worldly logic , but_from common obedience to the Spirit of Christ . Attentive to the sensus fidei of the People of God \u2013 '' which_they need to distinguish carefully from the changing currents of public opinion '' \u2013 the members of the Assembly offer their opinion to the Roman Pontiff so that it can_help him in his_ministry as universal Pastor of the Church . From this perspective , '' the fact_that the Synod ordinarily has only a consultative role does_not diminish its importance . In the Church the purpose of any collegial body , whether consultative or deliberative , -isaia- always the search_for truth or the good of the Church . When it -isaia- therefore a question involving the faith itself , the consensus ecclesiae -isaia- not determined by the tallying of votes , but_-isaia- the outcome of the working of the Spirit , the soul of the one Church of Christ '' . Therefore the vote of the Synod Fathers , '' if morally unanimous , has a qualitative ecclesial weight which surpasses the merely formal aspect of the consultative vote '' . Finally , the Synod Assembly itself must be followed by the implementation phase , so as to initiate the reception of the Synod s conclusions in all the local Churches , once they_have_been accepted by the Roman Pontiff in the manner he judges most appropriate . Here it must be remembered that '' cultures are in fact quite diverse , and every general principle . needs to be inculturated , if it -isaia- to be respected and applied '' . In this_way , it can be seen that the synodal process not_only has its point of departure but_also its point of arrival in the People of God , upon whom_the gifts of grace bestowed by the Holy Spirit through the gathering of Bishops in Assembly must be poured out . The Synod of Bishops , which_-isaia- '' in some manner the image '' of an Ecumenical Council and reflects its '' spirit and method '' , -isaia- composed of Bishops . Nevertheless , as also happened -atti_degli_apostoli- the Council , certain others who_are_not Bishops may be summoned to the Synod Assembly ; their role -isaia- determined in each case by the Roman Pontiff . In this connection , special consideration must_be_given to the contribution that_can be offered by members of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life . Besides the members , certain invited guests without voting rights may attend the Synod Assembly . These include Experts Periti , who help with the redaction of documents ; Auditors Auditores , who_have particular competence regarding the issues under discussion ; Fraternal Delegates from Churches and Ecclesial Communities not_yet in full_communion with the Catholic Church . To these may be added further special guests Invitati Speciales , chosen because_of_their acknowledged authority . The Synod of Bishops meets in various types of gathering . If circumstances so suggest , a single Synodal Assembly may be spread over more_than one session . Each Assembly , whatever its format , -isaia- an important opportunity_for collective listening to what_the Holy Spirit '' is saying to the churches '' Rev : . In the course of the synodal deliberations , then , particular importance should be attached to liturgical celebrations and other_forms of common prayer , so as to invoke the gifts of discernment and harmony upon the members of the assembly . It -isaia-_also right and just , following an ancient synodal tradition , that the Book of the Gospels be solemnly enthroned -atti_degli_apostoli- the start of each_day , symbolically reminding all the participants of the need_for docility to the divine_word , which_-isaia- the '' word of truth '' Col : . The General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops \u2013 consisting of the General Secretary , who chairs it , the Undersecretary , who assists the General Secretary in all his activities , and some special Councils of Bishops \u2013 -isaia- chiefly concerned_with implementation of the preceding Synodal Assembly and preparation_for the following one . In the phase preceding the Assembly , it chooses the themes to be discussed in the Synod Assembly from those proposed by the episcopate , it sees to their precise determination in relation to the needs of the People of God , and it initiates the consultative process and the drafting of the preparatory documents , incorporating the results of the consultation . In the phase following the Assembly , on the other_hand , together_with_the competent dicastery of the Roman Curia , it sees to the implementation of the synodal recommendations approved by the Roman Pontiff . Among the Councils that make up the General Secretariat , giving it its particular structure , special mention should be made of the Ordinary Council , consisting for the most part of diocesan Bishops elected by the Fathers of the Ordinary General Assembly . Ever since it was instituted in for the preparation and implementation of the Ordinary General Assembly , it has amply demonstrated its usefulness , responding as it were to the desire of the Council Fathers who asked for some Bishops to be co opted from among_those with pastoral responsibilities in various parts_of_the_world , as long term collaborators of the Roman Pontiff in his_ministry as Universal Pastor . In addition to the Ordinary Council , other Councils may be set up within_the General Secretariat , so as to prepare and implement Synodal Assemblies other_than the Ordinary General Assembly . At the same_time , the General Secretariat -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the constant disposal of the Roman Pontiff for whatever he may wish to ask of it , so as to avail himself of the sure counsel of Bishops in daily contact_with_the People of God , even outside the context of synodal gatherings . Another fruit of the Synod of Bishops -isaia- that it highlights more_and_more the profound communion that exists in Christ s Church both between_the Pastors and the faithful every ordained minister being a baptized person among_other baptized persons , established by God to feed his flock , and also between_the Bishops and the Roman Pontiff , the Pope being a '' Bishop among Bishops , called -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time \u2013 as Successor of Peter \u2013 to lead the Church of Rome which presides in charity over all the Churches '' . This prevents any_one subject from existing independently of the other . In particular , the College of Bishops never exists without its Head ; but likewise , the Bishop of Rome , who possesses '' full , supreme , universal power over the Church , and . -isaia- always able to exercise it without impediment , '' '' is always joined in full_communion with the other Bishops , and indeed with the whole Church '' . In this_regard , '' there_-isaia- no doubt_that the Bishop of Rome -isaia- in need of the presence of his Brother Bishops , of their guidance and of their prudence and experience . Indeed , the Successor of Peter must proclaim to all who Christ , the Son of the Living God -isaia- , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time he must pay attention to what_the Holy Spirit inspires on the lips of those_who accepting the word of Jesus who declares : you_are Peter cf . Mt : fully participate in the Apostolic College '' . Moreover , I -amos- confident that , by encouraging a '' conversion of the Papacy . which_can help make_the exercise of my ministry more faithful to the meaning which Jesus Christ wished to give it and to the present needs of evangelization , '' the activity of the Synod of Bishops will_be_able to make its_own contribution to the reestablishment of unity among all Christians , according to the will of the Lord cf . By doing so , it will_help the Catholic Church , according to the desire expressed years_ago by John Paul II , to '' find a way of exercising the primacy which , while in no way renouncing what_-isaia- essential to its mission , -isaia- nonetheless open to a new situation '' . In accordance_with canon of the Code of Canon Law and with the above considerations in mind , I hereby decree and establish the following : I . Synod Assemblies Art . Presidency and Format of the Synod Assemblies . The Synod of Bishops -isaia- directly subject to the Roman Pontiff , who_-isaia- its President . It -isaia- to meet : in Ordinary General Assembly , when matters are discussed which pertain to the good of the universal Church ; in Extraordinary General Assembly , when_the matters under discussion , pertaining to the good of the universal Church , require urgent consideration ; in Special Assembly , when matters are discussed which pertain principally to one or more particular geographical areas . If he considers it opportune , especially_for reasons of an ecumenical nature , the Roman Pontiff may summon a synodal Assembly according to other formats established by himself . Members and other Participants in the Synod Assemblies . The members of the Synod Assemblies are_those listed in canon of the Code of Canon Law . According to the theme and the circumstances , certain others who_are_not Bishops may be summoned to the Synod Assembly ; their role -isaia- determined in each case by the Roman Pontiff . The designation of members and other participants for each Assembly takes_place according to the norms of particular law . Sessions of the Synod Assembly . According to the theme and the circumstances , the Synod Assembly may be conducted in separate periods , held -atti_degli_apostoli- different times , -atti_degli_apostoli- the discretion of the Roman Pontiff . During the time between periods , the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops , together_with_the General Relator and the Special Secretary of the Assembly , has the task of promoting further reflection on the theme or on some aspects of particular importance that emerge from the work of the Assembly . The members and other participants remain in office uninterruptedly until the closure of the Synod Assembly . Phases of the Synod Assembly Each Synod Assembly unfolds in a series of phases : the preparatory phase , the discussion phase and the implementation phase . Preparatory Phase of the Synod Assembly Art . Start and Purpose of the Preparatory Phase . The preparatory phase begins when_the Roman Pontiff officially opens the Synod Assembly , assigning one or more themes to it .

In each particular Church , the Bishops carry_out the consultation of the People of God by recourse to the participatory bodies provided for by the law , without excluding other methods that_they deem appropriate . The Unions , the Federations and the male and female Conferences of Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life consult the Major Superiors , who in their turn may approach their_own Councils and other members of the Institutes and Societies in question . In the same_way , the Associations of the Faithful recognized by the Holy See consult their_own members . The dicasteries of the Roman Curia offer their contribution , taking account of their_respective particular areas of competence . The General Secretariat of the Synod may identify other_forms of consultation of the People of God . Transmission of the Preparatory Contributions to the General Secretariat of the Synod .

The aforementioned bodies , in their turn , transmit a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the texts they receive to the General Secretariat of the Synod . The Union of male Superiors General and the International Union of female Superiors General do likewise with the contributions prepared by the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life . The dicasteries of the Roman Curia transmit their contributions directly to the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops . The right of the faithful , individually or in association with_others , to submit their contributions directly to the General Secretariat of the Synod , remains intact . Convocation of a Pre Synodal Meeting .
