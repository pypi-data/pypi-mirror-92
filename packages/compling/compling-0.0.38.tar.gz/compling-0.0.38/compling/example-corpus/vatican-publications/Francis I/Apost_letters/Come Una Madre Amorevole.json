This -isaia-_the_duty that Christ himself entrusted to the entire Christian community as a whole . Aware of this , the Church -isaia-_especially vigilant in protecting children and vulnerable adults . This duty of care and protection devolves upon the whole Church , yet it -isaia-_especially through_her Pastors that it must be exercised . Therefore diocesan Bishops , Eparchs and those_who_have the responsibility_for a Particular Church must pay vigilant attention to protecting the weakest of those entrusted to her care . Canon Law already provides for the possibility of removal from ecclesiastical office '' for grave reasons '' . This pertains to diocesan Bishops and Eparchs as well , and those_who_are by law equal to them cf . With this Letter my intention -isaia- to underline that among the aforesaid '' grave reasons '' -isaia- the negligence of a Bishop in the exercise of his office , and in particular in relation to cases of sexual abuse inflicted on minors and vulnerable adults , as stated in the Motu Proprio Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela promulgated by St John Paul II and amended by my beloved Predecessor , Benedict XVI . In such cases the following procedure -isaia- to be observed : Article . The diocesan Bishop or Eparch , or one_who even holds a temporary title and -isaia- responsible_for a Particular Church , or other community of faithful that_-isaia- its legal equivalent , according to can . CCEO , can be legitimately removed from this office if he has through negligence committed or through omission facilitated acts that_have caused grave harm to others , either to physical persons or to the community as a whole . The harm may be physical , moral , spiritual or through the use of patrimony . The diocesan Bishop or Eparch can_only be removed if he -isaia- objectively lacking in a very grave manner the diligence that_his pastoral_office demands of him , even without serious moral fault on his part . In the case of the abuse of minors and vulnerable adults it -isaia- enough that the lack of diligence be grave . The Major Superiors of Religious Institutes and Societies of Apostolic Life of Pontifical Right are equivalent to diocesan Bishops and Eparchs . In all cases in which there_-isaia- foundational proof of what_-isaia- contained in the previous article , the competent Congregation of the Roman Curia can open an inquiry into the case , informing the subject involved and giving the accused the possibility of providing documentation and testimony . The Bishop will be given the possibility to defend himself , something he can do by the means provided for by law . All stages of the inquiry will be communicated and he will_always be given the possibility of meeting with the Superiors of the Congregation . This meeting will be proposed by the appropriate dicastery even should the Bishop himself take no initiative . In view of the arguments presented by the Bishop , the Congregation may decide to open a supplementary investigation . Before making a decision , the Congregation may meet , when appropriate , with_other Bishops or Eparchs belonging to the same Bishops Conference or Synod of Bishops of the sui iuris Church as the Bishop or Eparch in question , with the purpose of discussing the said case . The Congregation will adopt its determination when gathered in an Ordinary Session . Article Whenever the removal of a Bishop -isaia- held to be opportune , the Congregation , depending on the circumstances of the case , will establish whether : . to issue , and in the briefest possible amount of time , a decree of removal ; . to fraternally exhort the Bishop to present his letter of resignation within a period of fifteen days . If the Bishop does_not give his response within this period of time the Congregation can proceed to issue the decree of removal . Article The decision of the Congregation as stated in articles \u2013 must be submitted for the specific approval of the Roman Pontiff , who before making a definitive decision will_take counsel with a special College of Jurists designated for this_purpose . Everything that I have deliberated in this Apostolic Letter given Motu Proprio must be observed in all its parts , notwithstanding anything to the contrary , even if it be worthy of particular mention , and I hereby set_forth that it be published in the official records of Acta Apostolicae Sedis and promulgated in the daily edition of L Osservatore Romano , and enter_into force on September .
