CHARLES BORROMEOTO THE PATRIARCHS , PRIMATES , ARCHBISHOPS , BISHOPS , AND OTHER ORDINARIESIN PEACE AND COMMUNION WITH THE APOSTOLIC SEE Venerable Brethren , Health and the Apostolic Blessing . Sacred Scripture records the divine_word saying that_men will remember the just man forever , for even_though he -isaia- dead , he yet speaks . Both in word and deed the Church has for a long time verified the truth of that saying . She -isaia- the mother and the nurse of holiness , ever renewed and enlivened by the breath of the Spirit Who dwells in us . She alone conceives , nourishes , and educates the noble family of the just . Like a loving mother , she carefully preserves the memory of and affection for the saints . This remembrance -isaia- , as it were , a divine comfort which lifts her eyes above the miseries of this earthly pilgrimage so that_she finds in the saints '' her joy and her crown . '' Thus she sees in them the sublime image of her heavenly Spouse . Thus she shows her_children in each age the timeliness of the old truth : '' For those_who love God all things work together unto good , for those_who , according_to_his purpose , are saints through_his call . '' The glorious deeds of the saints , however , do more_than afford us comfort . In order that_we_may imitate and be encouraged by them , one and all the saints echo in their_own lives the saying of Saint Paul , '' I beg you , be imitators of me , as I -amos- of Christ . For that_reason , Venerable Brethren , immediately after Our elevation to the Supreme Pontificate We stated in Our first encyclical that We would labor without ceasing '' to restore all things in Christ . '' We begged everyone to turn their_eyes with Us to Jesus , '' the apostle and high_priest of our confession . the author and finisher of faith . '' Since the majesty of that Model may be too much for fallen human_nature , God mercifully gave Us another model to propose for your imitation , the glorious Virgin Mother of God . While being as close to Christ as human_nature permits , she_-isaia- better suited to the needs of our weak nature . Over and above that , We made use of several other occasions to recall_the memory of the saints . We emulated these faithful servants and ministers of God s household each in his_own way enjoying the friendship of God , '' who by faith conquered kingdoms , wrought justice , obtained promises . '' Thus encouraged by their example , we would be '' now no longer children , tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine devised in the wickedness of men , in craftiness , according to the wiles of error . Rather are we to practice the truth in love , and so grow up in all things in him_who_-isaia- the head , Christ . We have_already pointed to how Divine Providence was perfectly realized in the lives of those three great doctors and pastors of the Church , Gregory the Great , John Chrysostom and Anselm of Aosta . Although they_were separated by centuries , the Church was beset by many serious dangers in each of their_respective ages . In recent_years We celebrated all of their solemn centenaries . In a very_special way , however , we commemorated Saint Gregory the Great in the encyclical of March , , and Saint Anselm in the encyclical of April , . In these documents We treated those points of Christian doctrine and morals found in the example and teaching of these saints which We thought were best suited to our_times . As We have_already mentioned , We are of the opinion that the shining example of Christ s soldiers has far greater value in the winning and sanctifying of souls than the words of profound treatises . We therefore gladly take this present opportunity to teach some very useful lessons from the consideration of the life of another holy pastor whom God raised up in more recent_times and in the midst of trials very similar to those We are experiencing today . We refer to Saint Charles Borromeo , Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church and Archbishop of Milan , whom Paul V , of holy memory , raised to the altar of the saints less_than thirty years after_his death . The words of Our Predecessor are to the point : '' The Lord alone performs great wonders and in recent_times He has accomplished marvelous things among Us . In His wonderful dispensation He has set a great light on the Apostolic rock when He singled Charles out of the heart of the Roman Church as the faithful priest and good servant to be a model for the pastors and their flock . He enlightened the whole Church from the light diffused by his holy works . He shone forth before priests and people as innocent as Abel , pure as Enoch , tireless as Jacob , meek as Moses , and zealous as Elias . Surrounded by luxury , he exhibited the austerity of Jerome , the humility of Martin , the pastoral zeal of Gregory , the liberty of Ambrose , and the charity of Paulinus . In a word , he was a man we could see with our_eyes and touch with_our hands . He trampled earthly things underfoot and lived the life of the spirit . Although the world tried to entice him he lived crucified to the world . He constantly sought after heavenly things , not only_because he held the office of an angel but all because even on earth he tried to think and act as an angel . Such are the words of praise Our Predecessor wrote after Charles death . Now , three centuries after_his canonization , '' we can rightly rejoice on this_day when We solemnly confer , in the name of the Lord , the sacred honors on Charles , Cardinal Priest , thereby crowning his_own Spouse with a diadem of every precious stone . '' We agree with Our Predecessor that the contemplation of the glory and even_more , the example and teaching of the saints will humiliate the enemy and throw into confusion all those_who '' glory in their specious errors . '' Saint Charles -isaia- a model for both clergy_and_people in these_days . He was_the unwearied advocate and defender of the true Catholic reformation , opposing those innovators whose purpose was_not the restoration , but the effacement and destruction of faith_and_morals . This celebration of the third centenary of his canonization should prove to be not_only a consolation and lesson for_every Catholic but_also a noble incentive for everyone to cooperate wholeheartedly in that work so dear to Our heart of restoring all things in Christ . You know very well , Venerable Brethren , that even_when surrounded by tribulation the Church still enjoys some consolation from God . '' Christ also loved the Church , and delivered himself up for_her , that_he_might sanctify her . in order that_he_might present to himself_the Church in all her glory , not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing , but_that she might be holy and without blemish . '' When vice runs wild , when persecution hangs heavy , when error -isaia- so cunning that it threatens her destruction by snatching many children from her bosom and plunges them_into the whirlpool of sin and impiety then , more_than_ever , the Church -isaia- strengthened from above . Whether the wicked will it or not , God makes even error aid in the triumph of Truth whose guardian and defender -isaia- the Church . He puts corruption in the service of sanctity , whose mother and nurse -isaia- the Church . Out of persecution He brings a more wondrous '' freedom from our enemies . '' For these reasons , when worldly men think they see the Church buffeted and almost capsized in the raging storm , then she really comes forth fairer , stronger , purer , and brighter with the lustre of distinguished virtues . In such_a_way God s goodness bears_witness to the divinity of the Church . He makes her victorious in that painful battle against the errors and sins that creep into her ranks . Through this victory He verifies the words of Christ : '' The gates of hell shall_not prevail against it . '' In her day to day living He fulfills the promise , '' Behold , I -amos- with you all days , even unto the consummation of the world . '' Finally , He -isaia- the witness of that mysterious power of the other Paraclete Who Christ promised would come immediately after His ascension into_heaven , who continually lavishes His gifts upon her and serves as her defender and consoler in all her sorrows . This -isaia- the Spirit Who will '' dwell with you forever , the Spirit of truth whom_the world cannot receive , because it neither sees him nor knows him . he will dwell with you and be in you . '' The life and strength of the Church flows forth_from this font . As the ecumenical Vatican Council teaches , this_divine power sets the Church above every_other society by those obvious notes which mark her '' as a banner raised up among the nations . In fact , only a miracle of that divine power could preserve the Church , the Mystical Body of Christ , from blemish in the holiness of Her doctrine , law , and end in the midst of the flood of corruption and lapses of her members . Her doctrine , law and end have produced an abundant harvest . The faith and holiness of her_children have brought forth the most salutary fruits . Here -isaia- another proof of her divine_life : in spite of a great number of pernicious opinions and great variety of errors as well as the vast army of rebels the Church remains immutable and constant , '' as the pillar and foundation of truth , '' in professing one identical doctrine , in receiving the same Sacraments , in her_divine constitution , government , and morality . This -isaia- all the more marvelous when one considers that the Church not_only resists evil but_even '' conquers evil by doing good . '' She -isaia- constantly blessing friends and enemies alike . She -isaia- continually striving and ardently desiring to bring_about the social and individual Christian restoration which_-isaia- her particular mission in the world . Moreover , even her enemies benefit from it . This wonderful working of Divine Providence in the Church s program of restoration was seen with the greatest clarity and was_given as a consolation for the good especially in the century of Saint Charles Borromeo . In those days passions ran riot and knowledge of the truth was almost completely twisted and confused . A continual battle was being waged against errors . Human society , going from bad to worse , was rushing headlong into the abyss . Then those proud and rebellious men came on the scene who_are '' enemies of the cross of Christ . Their god_-isaia- the belly . they mind the things of earth . '' These men were_not concerned_with correcting morals , but only_with denying dogmas . Thus they increased the chaos . They dropped the reins of law , and unbridled licentiousness ran wild . They despised the authoritative guidance of the church and pandered to the whims of the dissolute princes and people . They tried to destroy the Church s doctrine , constitution and discipline . they_were similar to those sinners who_were warned long ago : '' Woe to you that call evil good , and good evil . '' They called this rebellious riot and perversion of faith_and_morals a reformation , and themselves reformers . In reality , they_were corrupters . In undermining the strength of Europe through wars and dissensions , they paved the way_for those modern rebellions and apostasy . This modern warfare has united and renewed in one attack the three kinds of attack which_have up until now been separated ; namely , the bloody conflicts of the first ages , the internal pests of heresies , and finally , in the name of evangelical liberty , the vicious corruption and perversion of discipline such as was unknown , perhaps , even in medieval times . Yet in each of these combats the Church has_always emerged victorious . God , however , brought forth real reformers and holy men to arrest the onrushing current , to extinguish the conflagration , and to repair the harm caused by this crowd of seducers . Their many sided zealous work of reforming discipline was especially consoling to the Church since_the tribulation afflicting her was so great . Their work also proves the truth_that '' God -isaia- faithful and . with the temptation will_also give_you a way out . '' In these circumstances God provided a pleasing consolation for the Church in the outstanding zeal and sanctity of Charles Borromeo . God ordained that his_ministry would be the effective and special means of checking the rebels boldness and teaching and inspiring the Church s children . He restrained the former s mad extravagances by the example of his_life and labor , and met their empty charges with the most powerful eloquence . He fanned the latter s hopes and kindled their zeal . Even from his youth he cultivated in a remarkable manner all the virtues of the true reformer which others possessed only in varying degrees . These virtues are fortitude , counsel , doctrine , authority , ability , and alacrity . He put them all in the service of Catholic truth against the attacks of error which_-isaia- precisely_the mission of the Church . He revived the faith_that had either become dormant or almost extinct in many by strengthening it with many wise laws and practices . He restored that discipline which_had_been overthrown by bringing the morals of clergy_and_people alike back to the ideals of Christian living . In executing all the duties of a reformer he also fulfilled the functions of the '' good and faithful servant . '' Later he performed the works of the high_priest who '' pleased God in his days and was found just . '' He -isaia- , therefore , a worthy example for both clergy and laity , rich and poor . He can be numbered among_those whose excellence as a bishop and prelate -isaia- eulogized by the Apostle Peter when he says_that he became '' from the heart a pattern to the flock . '' Even before the age of twenty three and although elevated to the highest honors and entrusted with very_important and difficult ecclesiastical matters , Charles made truly wonderful daily progress in the practice of virtue through the contemplation of divine things . This sacred retirement perfected him , prepared him for later days , and caused him to shine_forth as '' a spectacle to the world , and angels , and men . Then again borrowing the words of Our Predecessor , Paul V , the Lord began to work His wonders in Charles . He filled him_with a wisdom , justice , and burning zeal for promoting His glory and the Catholic cause . Above all , the Lord filled him_with a great concern_for restoring the faith in the Church universal according to the decrees of the renowned Council of Trent . That Pontiff himself , as well as all future generations , attributed the success of the Council to Charles , since even before carrying its decrees into action he was its most ardent promoter . In fact , his many vigils , trials , and labors brought its work to its ultimate completion . All these_things , however , were only a preparation or sort of novitiate where he trained his_heart in piety , his mind in study , and his_body in work always remaining a modest and humble youth for that life in which he would be as clay in the hands of God and His Vicar on earth . The innovators of that_time despised just that kind of life of preparation . The same folly leads the modern innovators also to spurn it . They fail to see_that God s wondrous works are matured in the obscurity and silence of a soul dedicated to obedience and contemplation . They cannot see_that just as the hope of the harvest lies in the sowing , so this preparation -isaia- the germ of future progress . As We have_already hinted , this sanctity and industry prepared under such conditions in due time came to produce a truly marvelous fruit . When Charles , '' good laborer that he was left the convenience and splendor of the city for the field Milan he was to cultivate , he discharged his duties better and better from day to day . Although the wickedness of the time had caused that field to become overrun with weeds and rank growths , he restored it to its pristine beauty . In time the Milanese Church became an example of ecclesiastical discipline . '' He effected all these outstanding results in his_work of reformation by adopting the rules the Council of Trent had only recently promulgated . The Church knows very well that '' the imagination and thought of man s heart are prone to evil . '' Therefore she wages continual battle against vice and error '' in order_that the body of sin may be destroyed , that_we_may no longer be slaves to sin . '' Since she_-isaia- her_own mistress and -isaia- guided by the grace_which '' -isaia- poured forth in our_hearts by the Holy Spirit , '' she -isaia-_directed in this conflict in thought and action by the Doctor of the Gentiles , who says , '' Be renewed in the spirit of your mind . And be not conformed to this_world , but be transformed in the newness of your mind , that_you_may discern what_-isaia- the good and acceptable and perfect will of God . '' The true son of the Church and reformer never thinks he has attained his goal . Rather , with the Apostle , he acknowledges that_he_-isaia- only striving for it : '' Forgetting what_-isaia- behind , I strain forward to what_-isaia- before , I press on towards_the goal , to the prize of God s heavenly call in Christ Jesus . Through our union with Christ in the Church we grow up '' in all things in him_who_-isaia- the head , Christ . For from him the whole_body . derives its increase to the building up for itself in love . '' For that_reason Mother Church daily fulfills the mystery of the Divine Will which_-isaia- '' to be dispensed in the fullness of the times : to re establish all things in Christ . The reformers that Borromeo opposed did not_even think of this . They tried to reform faith and discipline according_to_their own whims . Venerable Brethren , it -isaia- no better understood by those_whom We must withstand today . These moderns , forever prattling about culture and civilization , are undermining the Church s doctrine , laws , and practices . They are_not concerned very much about culture and civilization . By using such high sounding words they think they_can conceal the wickedness of their schemes . All of you_know their purpose , subterfuges , and methods . On Our part We have denounced and condemned their scheming . They are proposing a universal apostasy even worse than the one_that threatened the age of Charles . It -isaia- worse , We say , because it stealthily creeps into the very veins of the Church , hides there , and cunningly pushes erroneous principles to their ultimate conclusions . Both these heresies are fathered by the '' enemy '' who '' sowed weeds among the wheat '' in order to bring_about the downfall of mankind . Both revolts go about in the hidden ways of darkness , develop along the same line , and come to an end in the same fatal way . In the past the first apostasy turned where fortune seemed to smile . It set rulers against people or people against rulers only to lead both classes to destruction . Today this modern apostasy stirs up hatred between_the poor and the rich until , dissatisfied with_their station , they gradually fall_into such wretched ways that_they must pay the fine imposed on those_who , absorbed in worldly , temporal things , forget '' the kingdom of God and His justice . '' As a matter of fact , this present conflict -isaia- even more_serious than the others . Although the wild innovators of former times generally preserved some fragments of the treasury of revealed doctrine , these moderns act as if they_will not rest until they completely destroy it . When the foundations of religion are overthrown , the restraints of civil_society are_also necessarily shattered . Behold the sad spectacle of our_times ! Behold the impending danger of the future ! However , it -isaia- no danger to the Church , for the divine promise leaves no room_for doubt . Rather , this revolution threatens the family and nations , especially_those who actively stir up or indifferently tolerate this unhealthy atmosphere of irreligion . This impious and foolish war -isaia- waged and sometimes supported by those_who should be the first to come to Our aid . The errors appear in many forms and the enticements of vice wear different dresses . Both cause many even among our_own ranks to be ensnared , seducing them by the appearance of novelty and doctrine , or the illusion that the Church will accept the maxims of the age . Venerable Brethren , you are_well aware_that we must vigorously resist and repel the enemy s attacks with the very weapons Borromeo used in his day . Since they attack the very root of faith either by openly denying , hypocritically undermining , or misrepresenting revealed doctrine , we should above all recall_the truth Charles often taught . '' The primary and most important duty of pastors -isaia- to guard everything pertaining to the integral and inviolate maintenance of the Catholic Faith , the faith_which the Holy Roman Church professes and teaches , without which_it_-isaia- impossible to please God . '' Again : '' In this_matter no diligence can be too great to fulfill the certain demands of our office . '' We must_therefore use sound doctrine to withstand '' the leaven of heretical depravity , '' which if not repressed , will corrupt the whole . That -isaia- to say , we must oppose these erroneous opinions now deceitfully being scattered abroad , which , when taken all together , are_called Modernism . With Charles we must be mindful '' of the supreme zeal and excelling diligence which_the bishop must exercise in combating the crime of heresy . We need not mention the Saint s other_words echoing the sanctions and penalties decreed by the Roman Pontiffs against those prelates who_are negligent or remiss in purging the evil heresy out of their dioceses . It -isaia- fitting , however , to meditate on the conclusions he draws from_these papal decrees . '' Above everything else , '' he says , '' the Bishop must be eternally on guard and continually vigilant in preventing the contagious disease of heresy from entering among his flock and removing even the faintest suspicion of it from the fold . If it should happen to enter_the Lord forbid ! , he must use every_means -atti_degli_apostoli- his command to expel it immediately . Moreover , he must see_to_it_that those infected or suspected be treated according to the pontifical canons and sanctions . Liberation or immunity from this disease of heresy -isaia- possible only_when the clergy are properly instructed , since '' faith . depends on hearing , and hearing on the word of Christ . '' Today we must heed the words of truth . We see this poison penetrating through all the veins of the State from sources where it would be the least expected to such an extent_that the causes are the same as those Charles records in the following words : '' If those_who associate with heretics are_not firmly rooted in the Faith there_-isaia- reason to fear that_they_will easily be seduced by the heretics into the trap of impiety and false doctrine . '' Nowadays facility in travel and communication has proven just as advantageous for error as for other_things . We are living in a perverse society of unbridled license of passions in which '' there_-isaia- no truth . and there_-isaia- no knowledge of God , '' in '' all the land made desolate , because there_-isaia- none that considereth in the heart . '' For that_reason , borrowing the words of Charles , '' we have_already emphasized the importance of having all the faithful of Christ well instructed in the rudiments of Christian doctrine '' and have written a special encyclical_letter on that extremely important subject . However , We do not wish to repeat the lamentation Borromeo was moved to utter because of his burning zeal , namely_,_that '' up until now We have_received very little success in a matter of such importance . '' Rather , moved like him '' by the enormity and danger of the task , '' We would once_again urge everyone to make Charles his model of zeal so that he will contribute in this_work of Christian restoration according_to_his position and ability . Fathers and employers should recall how the holy Bishop frequently and fervently taught that_they_should not_only afford the opportunity but_even consider it their_duty to see_that their_children , servants , and employees study Christian doctrine . Clerics should remember_that they_must assist the parish priests in the teaching of Christian doctrine . Parish priests should erect as many schools for this_same purpose as the number and needs of the people demand . They should further take_care that_they_have upright teachers , who_will be assisted by men_and_women of good morals according to the manner the holy Archbishop Milan prescribed . Obviously the need of this Christian instruction -isaia- accentuated by the decline of our_times and morals . It -isaia- even_more demanded by the existence of those public schools , lacking all religion , where everything holy -isaia- ridiculed and scorned . There both teachers lips and students ears are inclined to godlessness . We are referring to those schools which_are unjustly called neutral or lay . In reality , they_are nothing_more than the stronghold of the powers of darkness . You have_already , Venerable Brethren , fearlessly condemned this_new trick of mocking liberty especially in those countries where_the rights of religion and the family have_been disgracefully ignored and the voice of nature which demands respect_for the faith and innocence of youth has_been stifled . Firmly resolved to spare no effort in remedying this evil caused by those_who expect others to obey them although they refuse to obey the Supreme Master of all things themselves , We have recommended that schools of Christian doctrine be erected in those cities where it -isaia- possible . Thanks to your efforts , this_work has_already made good progress . It -isaia- , however , very much to be desired that_this work spread even_more widely , with many such religious schools established everywhere and teachers of sound doctrine and good morals provided . The preacher whose duty -isaia- closely allied to the teacher of the fundamentals of religion should_also have_the same qualities of sound doctrine and good morals . For that_reason , when drawing up the statutes of the provincial and diocesan synods , Charles was most careful to provide preachers full of zeal and holiness to exercise '' the ministry of the word . '' We are convinced_that this care -isaia- even_more urgent in our_times when so many men_are wavering in the Faith and some vain glorious men , filled_with_the spirit of the age , '' adulterate the word of God '' and deprive the faithful of the food of life . We must spare no pains , Venerable Brethren , in seeing that the flock does_not feed on this air of foolish empty headed men . Rather , it should be nourished with the life_giving food of '' the ministers of the word . '' These can truly say , '' On behalf of Christ . we are acting as ambassadors , God , as it were , appealing through us . we avoid unscrupulous conduct , we do not corrupt the word of God ; but making known the truth , we commend ourselves to every man s conscience in the sight of God . '' We are workmen '' that cannot be ashamed , rightly handling the word of truth . '' Those very holy and fruitful rules the Bishop of Milan frequently laid_down for his people_have a similar value for us . They can best be summarized in these_words of Saint Paul : '' When you heard and received_from us the word of God , you welcomed it not as the word of man , but , as it truly -isaia- , the word of God , who works in you who_have believed . '' The word of God -isaia- living and efficient and keener than_any two edged sword . '' It will not_only preserve and defend the faith but_also effectively motivate us to do good_works since '' faith . without works -isaia- dead . '' '' For it -isaia- not they_who hear_the Law that_are just in the sight of God ; but_it_-isaia- they_who follow_the Law that_will be justified . Now in this also we see the immense difference between true and false reform . The advocates of false reform , imitating the fickleness of the foolish , generally rush into extremes . They either emphasize faith to such an extent_that they neglect good_works or they canonize nature with the excellence of virtue while overlooking the assistance of faith and divine_grace . As a matter of fact , however , merely naturally good acts are only a counterfeit of virtue since_they are neither permanent nor sufficient for salvation . The work of this_kind of a reformer cannot restore discipline . On the contrary , it ruins faith_and_morals . On the other_hand , the sincere and zealous reformer will ; like Charles , avoid extremes and never overstep the bounds of true reform . He will_always be united in the closest bonds with the Church and Christ , her Head . There he will_find not_only strength for his interior life but_also the directives he needs in order to carry_out his_work of healing human_society . The function of this_divine mission , which_has from time immemorial been handed_down to the ambassadors of Christ , -isaia- to '' make disciples of all nations '' both the things they_are to believe as well as the things they_are to do since Christ Himself said , '' Observe all that I have commanded you . '' He -isaia- '' the way , and the truth , and the life , '' coming into_the_world that_man '' may_have life , and have it more abundantly . '' The fulfillment of these duties , however , far surpasses man s natural powers . The Church alone possesses together_with her magisterium the power of governing and sanctifying human_society . Through her ministers and servants each in his_own station and office , she confers on mankind suitable and necessary means of salvation . True reformers understand this_very clearly . They do not kill the blossom in saving the root . That -isaia- to say , they_do_not divorce faith from holiness . They rather cultivate both of them , enkindling them_with_the fire of charity , '' which_-isaia- the bond of perfection . '' In obedience to the Apostle , they '' keep the deposit . '' They neither obscure nor dim its light before the nations , but spread far and wide the most saving waters of truth and life welling up from that spring . They combine theory and practice . By the former they_are prepared to withstand the '' masquerading of error '' and by the latter they apply the commandments to moral activity . In such_a_way they employ all the suitable and necessary means_for attaining the end , namely , the wiping out of sin and the perfecting '' the saints for a work of ministry , for building up the body of Christ . '' This -isaia- the purpose of every_kind of instruction , government , and munificence . In a word , this_-isaia- the ultimate purpose of every discipline and action of the Church . When the true son of the church sets out to reform himself and others , he fixes his eyes and heart on matters of faith_and_morals . On just such matters Borromeo based his reformation of ecclesiastical discipline . Thus he often referred to them in his writings , as , for example , when he says , '' Following the ancient custom of the holy Fathers and sacred Councils , especially_the ecumenical Synod of Trent , we have decreed many regulations on these very matters in our preceding provincial Councils . '' In the same_way , when providing for the suppression of public scandals , he declares that_he_-isaia- following '' both the law and sacred sanctions of the sacred canons , and especially_the decrees of the Council of Trent . However , he did_not stop -atti_degli_apostoli- that . In order to assure as much as possible that he would never depart from this rule , he customarily concluded the statutes of his provincial Synods with the following words : '' We are always prepared to submit everything we have_done and decreed in this provincial Synod to the authority and judgment of the Roman Church , the Mother and Mistress of all the churches . '' The more quickly he advanced in the perfection of the active ministry the more firmly was he rooted in this resolve , not only_when the Chair of Peter was occupied by his uncle , but_also during the Pontificates of his_successors , Pius V and Gregory XIII . He wielded his influence in having these latter elected ; he was tireless in supporting their great endeavors ; and he fulfilled in a perfect manner whatever they expected of him . Moreover , he seconded every_one of their acts with the practical means needed to realize the end in view , namely , the real reform of sacred discipline . In this respect also he proved that in no wise he resembled those false reformers who concealed their obstinate disobedience under the cloak of zeal . He began '' the judgment . with the household of God . '' He first of all restored discipline among the clergy by making them conform to certain definite laws . With this_same end in view he built seminaries , founded a congregation of priests known as the Oblates , unified both the ancient and modern religious families , and convoked Councils . By these and other provisions he assured and developed the work of reform . Then he immediately set a vigorous hand to the work of reforming the morals of the people . He considered the words spoken to the Prophet as addressed to himself ; '' Lo , I have set thee this_day . to root up and to pull down , and to waste and to destroy , and to build and to plant . '' Good shepherd that he was , he personally set_out on wearisome visitation of the churches of the province . Like the Divine Master '' he went about doing good and healing . '' He spared no efforts in suppressing and uprooting the abuses he met everywhere either because of ignorance or neglect of the laws . He checked the rampant perversion of ideas and corruption of morals by founding schools for the children and colleges for youth . After seeing their early beginnings in Rome , he promoted the Marian societies . He founded orphanages for the fatherless , shelters for girls in danger , widows , mendicants , and men_and_women made destitute by sickness or old age . He opened institutions to protect the poor against tyrannical masters , usurers , and the enslavement of children . He accomplished all these_things by completely ignoring the methods of those_who think human_society can be restored only by utter destruction , revolution , and noisy slogans . Such persons have forgotten the divine words : '' The Lord -isaia- not in the earthquake . Here -isaia- another difference between true and false reformers which_you , Venerable Brethren , have often encountered . The latter '' seek their_own interests , not those of Jesus Christ . '' They listen to the deceitful invitation once addressed to the Divine Master , '' Manifest thyself to the world . '' They repeat the ambitious words , '' Let us also get us a name '' and in their rashness which We unfortunately have to deplore in these_days '' some priests fell in battle , while desiring to do manfully , they went out unadvisedly to fight . On the other_hand , the true reformer '' seeks not his_own glory , but the glory of the one_who sent him . '' Like Christ , his Model , '' he will_not wrangle , nor cry aloud , neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets . He shall_not be sad nor troublesome '' but he shall be '' meek and humble of heart . '' For that_reason he will please the Lord and bring forth abundant fruit for salvation . They are distinguished one from the other in yet another way . The false reformer '' trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm . '' The true reformer places his trust in God and seeks His supernatural aid for all his strength and virtue , making his_own the Apostle s words : '' I can do all things in him_who strengthens me . Christ lavishly communicates these aids , among which_are especially prayer , sacrifice and the Sacraments , which '' become . a fountain of water , springing up into life everlasting . '' Since the Church has_been endowed_with them_for the salvation of all men , the faithful man will look for them in her . False reformers , however , despise these means . They make_the road crooked and , so wrapped up in reforming that_they forget God , they_are always trying to make these crystal springs so cloudy or arid that the flock of Christ will be deprived of their waters . In this respect the false reformers of former days are even surpassed by their modern followers . These latter , wearing the mask of religiosity , discredit and despise these means of salvation , especially_the two Sacraments which cleanse the penitent soul from sin and feed it with celestial food . Let every faithful pastor , therefore , employ the utmost zeal in seeing that the benefits of such_great value be held in the highest esteem . Let them never permit these_two works of divine_love to grow cold in the hearts of men . Borromeo conducted himself in precisely that way . Thus we read in his writings : '' Since the fruit of the Sacraments -isaia- so abundantly effective , its value can be explained with no little difficulty . They should , therefore , be treated and received with the greatest preparation , deepest reverence , and external pomp and ceremony . '' His exhortations which We have_also made in Our decree , Tridentina Synodus to pastors and preachers concerning the ancient practice of frequent Holy Communion -isaia- most worthy of notice . '' Pastors and preachers , '' the holy Bishop writes , '' should_take every possible opportunity to urge the people to cultivate the practice of frequently receiving Holy Communion . In this they_are following_the_example of the early Church , the recommendations of the most authoritative Fathers , the doctrine of the Roman Catechism which treats this_matter in detail , and , finally the teaching of the Council of Trent . The last mentioned would_have the faithful receive Communion in every Mass , not_only spiritually but sacramentally . '' He describes the intention and affection one should_have in approaching the Sacred Banquet in the following words : '' The people should_not only be urged to receive Holy Communion frequently , but_also how dangerous and fatal it would be to approach the Sacred Table of Divine Food unworthily . '' It would seem that_our days of wavering faith and coldness need this_same fervor in a special_way so that frequent reception of Holy Communion will_not be accompanied by a decrease in reverence toward this_great mystery . On the contrary , by this frequency a man should '' prove himself , and so let_him eat of that bread and drink of the cup . An abundant stream of grace will flow from_these fonts , strengthening and nourishing even natural and human means . By no means will a Christian neglect those useful and comforting things of this_life , for these also come from the hands of God , the Author of grace and nature . In seeking and enjoying these material and physical things , however , he will be careful not to make_them the end and quasi beatitude of this_life . He will use them rightly and temperately when he subordinates them to the salvation_of_souls , according to Christ s words : '' Seek first the kingdom of God and His justice , and all these_things shall be given you besides . This wise evaluation and use of means -isaia- not in the least opposed to the happiness of that inferior ordering of means in civil_society . On the contrary , the former promotes the latter s welfare not , of course , by the foolish prattle of quarrelsome reformers , but by acts and heroic efforts , even to the extent of sacrificing property , power , and life_itself . We have many examples of this fortitude during the Church s worst days in the lives of many bishops_who , equaling Charles zeal , put into_practice the Divine Master s words : '' The good_shepherd lays down his_life for his sheep . '' Neither vainglory , party spirit , nor private interest -isaia- their motive . They are moved to spend themselves for the common_good by that charity '' which never fails . '' This flame of love cannot be seen by the eyes of the world . It so enkindled Borromeo , however_,_that , after endangering his own_life in caring for the victims of the plague , he did_not rest with merely warding off present evils but began to provide_for the dangers the future might have in store . '' It -isaia- no more_than right that a good and loving father will provide_for his_children s future as well as their present by setting aside the necessities of life_for them . In virtue of our_duty of paternal love , we are_also prudently providing for the faithful of our province by setting aside those aids for the future which_the experience of the plague has taught us are_most effective . These same loving plans and considerations can be put into_practice , Venerable Brethren , in that Catholic Action We have so often recommended . The leaders of the people are_called to engage in this_very noble apostolate which includes all the works of mercy which_will be prepared and ready to sacrifice all they_have and are for the cause . They must bear envy , contradiction , and even the hatred of many who_will repay their labors with ingratitude . They must conduct themselves as '' good soldiers of Jesus Christ . '' They must '' run with patience to the fight set before us ; looking towards_the author and finisher of faith , Jesus Christ . '' Without a doubt , this_-isaia- a very difficult contest . Nevertheless , even_though a total victory will be slow in coming , it -isaia- a contest that serves the welfare of civil_society in a most worthy manner . In this_work we have_the splendid example of Saint Charles . From his example each_one of us can_find much for imitation and consolation . Even though his outstanding virtue , his marvelous activity , his never failing charity commanded much respect , he was nonetheless subject to that law which reads , '' All who want to live piously in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution . '' His austere life , his defense of righteousness and honesty , his protection of law and justice only led to his being hated by rulers and tricked by diplomats and , later , distrusted by the nobility , clergy_and_people until he was eventually so hated by wicked men that_they sought his_very life . In spite of his mild and gentle disposition he withstood all these attacks with unflinching courage . He yielded no ground on any matter that_would endanger faith_and_morals . He admitted no claim even if it was_made by a powerful monarch who_was always a Catholic that_was either contrary to discipline or burdensome to the faithful . He was always mindful of Christ s words : '' Render . to Caesar the things_that_are Caesar s , and to God the things_that_are God s . '' He never forgot the Apostles declaration : '' We must obey God rather_than men . '' Thus he was religion s and society s chief benefactor . In his time civil_society was paying the price of almost certain destruction because of its worldly prudence . It was practically shipwrecked in the seditious storms it had stirred up . The Catholics of our days , together_with their leaders , the Bishops , will deserve the same praise and gratitude as Charles as long as they_are faithful to their_duties of good citizenship . They must be as faithful in their loyalty and respect to '' wicked rulers '' when their commands are just , as they_are adamant in resisting their commands when unjust . They must remain as far from the impious rebellion of those_who advocate sedition and revolt as they_are from the subservience of those_who accept as sacred the obviously wicked laws of perverse men . These last mentioned wicked men uproot everything in the name of a deceitful liberty , and then oppress their subjects with the most abject tyranny . This -isaia- precisely what_-isaia- happening today in the sight of the whole_world and in the broad light of modern civilization . Especially -isaia- this_the case in some_countries where '' the powers of darkness '' seem to have_made their headquarters . This domineering tyranny has suppressed all the rights of the Church s children . These rulers hearts have_been closed to all feelings of generosity , courtesy , and faith_which their ancestors , who gloried in the name of Christians , manifested for so long a time . It -isaia- obvious that everything quickly lapses back into the ancient barbarism of license whenever God and the Church are hated . It would be more correct to say that everything falls under that_most cruel yoke from which only the family of Christ and the education it introduced has freed us . Borromeo expressed the same thought in the following words : '' It -isaia- a certain , well established fact_that no other crime so seriously offends God and provokes His greatest wrath as the vice of heresy . Nothing contributes more to the down fall of provinces and kingdoms than_this frightful pest . '' Although the enemies of the Church completely disagree among_themselves in thought and action which_-isaia- a sure indication of error , they_are nevertheless united in their obstinate attacks against truth and justice . Since the Church -isaia- the guardian and defender of both these virtues , they close their ranks in a unified attack against her . Of course , they loudly proclaim as -isaia- the custom their impartiality and firmly maintain they_are only promoting the cause of peace . In reality , however , their soft words and avowed intentions are only the traps they_are laying , thus adding insult to injury , treason to violence . From this it should be evident_that a new kind of warfare -isaia-_now being waged against Christianity . Without a doubt it -isaia- far more dangerous than those former conflicts which crowned Borromeo with_such glory . His example and teaching will do much to help us wage a valiant battle on behalf of the noble cause which_will save the individual and society , faith , religion , and the inviolability of public order . Our combat , it -isaia- true , will be spurred on by bitter necessity . At the same_time , however , we will be encouraged by the hope_that the omnipotent God will hasten the victory for the sake of those_who wage so glorious a contest . This hope increases through the fruitfulness of the work of Saint Charles even down to our_own times . His work humbles the proud and strengthens us in the holy resolve to restore all things in Christ . We can now conclude , Venerable Brethren , with the same words with_which Our Predecessor , Paul V whom We already mentioned several times , concluded the letter conferring the highest honors on Charles . '' In the meantime , '' he wrote , '' it -isaia- only right that we return honor , glory , and benediction to Him Who lives for all ages , for He blessed Our fellow servant with every spiritual gift in order to make him holy and spotless in His sight . The Lord gave him to us as a star shining in the darkness of these sins which_are Our affliction . Let us beseech the Divine Goodness both in word and deed to let Charles now assist by his patronage the Church he loved so ardently and aided so greatly by his merits and example , thus making peace for us in the day of wrath , through Christ Our Lord . May the fulfillment of our mutual hope be granted through_this prayer . As a token of that fulfillment , Venerable Brethren , from the depth of Our heart We impart to you and the clergy_and_people committed to your_care , the Apostolic Blessing .
