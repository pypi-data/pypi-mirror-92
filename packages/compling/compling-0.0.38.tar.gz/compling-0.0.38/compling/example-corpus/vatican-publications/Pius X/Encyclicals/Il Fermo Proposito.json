The firm purpose and desire which We resolved upon -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of Our Pontificate to consecrate all the energy which_the good Lord deigns to grant Us in the work of restoring all things in Christ , reawakens in Our heart a great trust in the all powerful grace of God . Without that grace We can neither plan nor undertake anything great or fruitful for the good of souls here below . At the same_time , however , We feel more_than_ever the need of being upheld unanimously and constantly in this venture both by you , Venerable Brethren , called to participate in Our pastoral_office , as well as by all the clergy and faithful committed to your_care . Truly , all of us in the Church are_called to form that unique Body , whose Head -isaia- Christ ; '' closely joined , '' as the Apostle Paul teaches , '' and knit together through every joint of the system according to the functioning in due measure of each single part . '' In such_a_way the Body increases and gradually perfects itself in the bond of charity . Now , if in this_work of '' building up the body of Christ '' it -isaia- Our primary duty to teach , to point_out the correct way to follow , to propose the means to be used , to admonish and paternally exhort , it -isaia-_also the duty of Our beloved_children , dispersed throughout_the_world , to heed Our words , to carry them out first of all in their_own lives , and to aid in their effective fulfillment in others , each_one according to the grace of God received , according_to_his state in life and duties , and according to the zeal which inflames his_heart . Here We wish to recall those numerous works of zeal for the good of the Church , society , and individuals under the general name of '' Catholic Action , '' which by the grace of God flourish throughout_the_world as well as in Our Italy . You well know , Venerable Brethren , how dear they_are to Us and how fervently We long to see them strengthened and promoted . Not only have We spoken to not_a_few of you on many occasions as well as to their special representatives in Italy when_they presented Us with the homage of their devotion and filial affection , but We have_also published , or have_had published by Our authority , various acts of which_you already know . It -isaia- true that_some of these , as the circumstances truly sorrowful for Us demanded , were directed -atti_degli_apostoli- removing obstacles which hindered the progress of Catholic Action and caused great harm , by undisciplined tendencies , to the common_good . For that_reason We hesitated to offer a paternal word of comfort and encouragement to all throughout_the_world , in order_that , only after We had removed as much as We possibly could all dangers throughout_the_world , the good would be able to increase and spread abroad . We are_now , therefore , very happy to do so by this present letter in order to encourage everyone , for We are certain_that Our words will be heard in a spirit of docility and obeyed by all . The field of Catholic Action -isaia- extremely vast . In itself it does_not exclude anything , in any manner , direct or indirect , which pertains to the divine mission of the Church . Accordingly one_can plainly see_how necessary it -isaia- for everyone to cooperate in such an important work , not_only_for the sanctification of his_own soul , but_also_for the extension and increase of the Kingdom of God in individuals , families , and society ; each_one working according_to_his energy for the good of his neighbor by the propagation of revealed_truth , by the exercise of Christian virtues , by the exercise of the corporal and spiritual works of mercy . Such -isaia- the conduct worthy of God to which Saint Paul exhorts us , so as to please Him in all things , bringing forth fruits of all good_works , and increasing in the knowledge of God . '' May you walk worthily of God and please him in all things , bearing fruit in every good work and growing in the knowledge of God . Over and above spiritual goods , however , there_are_many goods of the natural order over which_the Church has no direct mission , although they flow as a natural consequence from her_divine mission . The light of Catholic revelation -isaia- of such a nature that it diffuses itself with the greatest brilliance on every science . The force of the evangelical_counsels -isaia- so powerful that it strengthens and firmly establishes the precepts of the natural_law . The fruitfulness of the doctrine and morality taught by Jesus Christ -isaia- so limitless that providentially it sustains and promotes the material welfare of the individual , the family , and society . The Church , even in preaching Jesus Christ crucified , '' stumbling block and foolishness to the world , '' has become the foremost leader and protector of civilization . She brought it wherever her apostles preached . She preserved and protected the good elements of the ancient pagan civilizations , disentangling from barbarism and educating for a new civilization the peoples who flocked to her_maternal bosom . She endowed every civilization , gradually , but_with a certain and always progressive step , with_that excellent mark which_-isaia- today universally preserved . The civilization of the world_-isaia- Christian . The more completely Christian it -isaia- , the more true , more lasting and more productive of genuine fruit it -isaia- . On the other_hand , the further it draws away from the Christian ideal , the more seriously the social_order -isaia- endangered . By the very nature of things , the Church has consequently become the guardian and protector of Christian society . That fact was universally recognized and admitted in other periods of history . In truth , it formed a solid foundation for civil legislation . On that_very fact rested the relations_between Church and State ; the public recognition of the authority of the Church in those matters which touched upon conscience in any manner , the subordination of all the laws of the State to the Divine laws of the Gospel ; the harmony of the two powers in securing the temporal welfare of the people in such_a_way_that their eternal welfare did_not suffer . We have no need to tell you , Venerable Brethren , what prosperity and well_being , what peace and harmony , what respectful subjection to authority and what excellent government would be obtained and maintained in the world if one could see in practice the perfect ideal of Christian civilization . Granting , however , the continual battle of the flesh against the spirit , darkness against light , Satan against God , such cannot be hoped for , -atti_degli_apostoli- least in all its fullness . Hence , raids are continually being made on the peaceful conquests of the Church . The sadness and pain these cause -isaia- accentuated by the fact_that society tends more_and_more to be governed by principles opposed to that_very Christian ideal , and -isaia- even in danger of completely falling away from God . This fact , however , -isaia- no reason to lose courage . The Church well knows that the gates of hell will_not prevail against her . Furthermore , she knows that she_will be sorely afflicted ; that her apostles are sent as lambs among wolves ; that her followers will_always bear the brunt of hatred and contempt , just as her Divine Founder received hatred and contempt . So the Church advances unafraid , spreading the Kingdom of God wherever she preaches and studying every possible means she_can use in regaining the losses in the kingdom already conquered . '' To restore all things in Christ '' has_always_been the Church s motto , and it -isaia-_especially Our Own during these fearful moments through_which we are_now passing . '' To restore all things '' not in any haphazard fashion , but '' in Christ '' ; and the Apostle adds , '' both those in the heavens and those on the earth . '' '' To restore all things in Christ '' includes not_only what properly pertains to the divine mission of the Church , namely , leading souls to God , but_also what We have_already explained as flowing from that divine mission , namely , Christian civilization in each_and_every one of the elements composing it . Since We particularly dwell on this last part of the desired restoration , you clearly see , Venerable Brethren , the services rendered to the Church by those chosen bands of Catholics who aim to unite all their forces in combating anti Christian civilization by every just and lawful means . They use every_means in repairing the serious disorders caused by it . They seek to restore Jesus Christ to the family , the school and society by re establishing the principle that_human authority represents the authority of God . They take to heart_the interests of the people , especially_those of the working and agricultural classes , not_only by inculcating in the hearts of everybody a true religious spirit the only true fount of consolation among the troubles of this_life but_also by endeavoring to dry their tears , to alleviate their sufferings , and to improve their economic condition by wise measures . They strive , in a word , to make public laws conformable to justice and amend or suppress those_which are_not so . Finally , they defend and support in a true Catholic spirit the rights of God in all things and the no less sacred rights of the Church . All these works , sustained and promoted chiefly by lay Catholics and whose form varies ac cording to the needs of each country , constitute what_-isaia- generally known by a distinctive and surely a very noble name : '' Catholic Action , '' or the '' Action of Catholics . '' At all times it came to the aid of the Church , and the Church has_always cherished and blessed such help , using it in many_ways according to the exigencies of the age . In passing it -isaia- well to remark that_it_-isaia- impossible today to re establish under the same form all the institutions which_have_been useful and even the only effective ones in past centuries , so numerous the new needs which changing circumstances keep producing . But the Church in its long history and on every occasion has wisely shown that_she possesses the marvelous power of adapting herself to the changing conditions of civil_society . Thus , while preserving the integrity and immutability of faith_and_morals and upholding her sacred rights , she easily bends and accommodates herself to all the unessential and accidental circumstances belonging to various stages of civilization and to the new requirements of civil_society . '' Godliness , '' says Saint Paul , '' -isaia- profitable in all respects , since it has the promise of the present life as well as of that_which_-isaia- to come . '' Even though Catholic Action changes in its external forms and in the means_that it adapts , it always remains the same in the principles that direct it and the noble goal that it pursues . In order_that Catholic Action may reach its goal , it -isaia- important to consider -atti_degli_apostoli- this_point the conditions it imposes , its_nature and its goal . Above all , one_must be firmly convinced_that the instrument -isaia- of little value if it -isaia- not adapted to the work -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . In regard to the things We mentioned above , Catholic Action , inasmuch as it proposes to restore all things in Christ , constitutes a real apostolate for the honor and glory of Christ Himself . To carry it out right one must_have divine_grace , and the apostle receives it only if he -isaia- united to Christ . Only when he has formed Jesus Christ in himself shall he more_easily be able to restore Him to the family and society . Therefore , all who_are called_upon to direct or dedicate themselves to the Catholic cause , must be sound Catholics , firm in faith , solidly instructed in religious matters , truly submissive to the Church and especially to this supreme Apostolic See and the Vicar of Jesus Christ . They must be men of real piety , of manly virtue , and of a life so chaste and fearless that_they_will be a guiding example to all others . If they_are_not so formed it will be difficult to arouse others to do good and practically impossible to act with a good intention . The strength needed to persevere in continually bearing the weariness of every true apostolate will fail . The calumnies of enemies , the coldness and frightfully little cooperation of even good men , sometimes even the jealousy of friends and fellow workers excusable , undoubtedly , on account of the weakness of human_nature , but_also harmful and a cause of discord , offense and quarrels all these will weaken the apostle who lacks divine_grace . Only virtue , patient and firm and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time mild and tender , can remove or diminish these difficulties in such_a_way_that the works undertaken by Catholic forces will_not be compromised . The will of God , Saint Peter wrote the early Christians , -isaia- that by your good_works you silence the foolish . '' For such_-isaia- the will of God , that by doing good you_should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men . It -isaia-_also important to define clearly_the works which_the Catholic forces must energetically and constantly undertake . These works must be of such evident importance that_they_will be appreciated by everybody . They must bear such a relation to the needs of modern society and be so well adapted to moral and material interests , especially_those of the people and the poorer classes , that , while arousing in promoters of Catholic Action the greatest activity for obtaining the important and certain results which_are to be looked for , they_may also be readily understood and gladly welcomed by all . Since the serious problems of modern social_life demand a prompt and definite solution , everyone -isaia- anxious to know and understand_the different_ways in which these solutions can be put into_practice . Discussions of one kind or another are more_and_more numerous and rapidly published by the press . It -isaia- , therefore , of the greatest importance that Catholic Action seize the present moment and courageously propose its_own solution , strengthening it by means of solid propaganda which -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time will be active , intelligent , disciplined and organized against all erroneous doctrine . The goodness and justice of Christian principles , the true morality which Catholics profess , their evident unconcern for their_own welfare while wishing nothing but the supreme good of others , and their open and sincere ability to foster better_than all others the true economic interests of the people these qualities cannot_fail to make an impression on the minds and hearts of all who hear them , and to swell their ranks so as to form a strong and compact corps , capable of boldly resisting the opposing current and of commanding the respect of their enemies . Our Predecessor , Leo XIII , of blessed memory , has pointed_out , especially in that memorable encyclical '' Rerum Novarum '' and in later documents , the object to which Catholic Action should be particularly devoted , namely , '' the practical solution of the social_question according to Christian principles . '' Following these wise rules , We Ourselves in Our motu_proprio of December , , concerning Popular Christian Action which in itself embraces the whole Catholic social movement We Ourselves have laid_down fundamental principles_which should serve as a practical rule of action as well as a bond of harmony and charity . On these documents , therefore and within their most_holy and necessary scope , Catholic Action , although varied and multiple in form while directed toward_the same social good , must be regulated and united . In order_that this social action may continue and prosper by a necessary union of the various activities comprising it , Catholics above all must preserve a spirit of peace and harmony which_can come only from a unity in understanding . On this_point there cannot exist the least shadow or peradventure of a doubt , so clear and obvious are the teachings handed_down by this Apostolic See , so brilliant -isaia- the light_which most illustrious Catholics of every country have spread by their writings , so praiseworthy -isaia- the example of Catholics of other countries who , because of this harmony and unity of understanding , in a short time have reaped an abundant harvest . To arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- this_end , in some places several of these praiseworthy works have called into being an institution of a general character which goes by the name of the '' Popular Union . '' Experience has shown that_this has_been most effective . The purpose of the Popular Union has_been to gather all Catholics , and especially_the masses , around a common center of doctrine , propaganda , and social organization . Since , in fact , it answers a need felt in almost every country and its constitution -isaia- founded upon the very nature of things , it cannot be said to belong any more to one nation than another , but_-isaia- suitable to every place_where the same needs are present and the same dangers arise . Its extremely popular character causes it to be most desirable and acceptable . It neither disturbs nor hinders the work of existing institutions but , on the contrary , increases their strength and efficiency . Because of its strictly personal organization , it spurs individuals to enter particular institutions , training them to perform practical and useful work , and uniting them all together in one common aim and desire . Once the social center -isaia- thus established , all other institutions of an economic character concerned in various_ways with the social problem will find_themselves spontaneously united by their common end . At the same_time , however , they_will preserve their_own individual structure , and in providing various needs they_will still remain within_the boundaries which their sphere of influence demands . At this_point We are pleased to express Our satisfaction with the great good which in this_regard has_already_been accomplished in Italy , and We feel certain_that , with the help of God , much_more will be done by this_kind of zeal in the future to strengthen and increase the good already accomplished . The work of the Catholic Congresses and Committees -isaia- of singular merit , thanks to the intelligent activity of those capable men_who plan and direct them . Such economic centers and unions , however , as We have previously stated -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the above mentioned Congresses , must continue to carry on in the same_way and under the same expert direction . For Catholic Action to be most effective it -isaia-_not_enough that it adapt itself to social needs only . It must_also employ all those practical means which_the findings of social_and_economic studies place in its hands . It must profit from the experience gained elsewhere . It must be vitally aware of the conditions of civil_society , and the public_life of states . Otherwise it runs the risk of wasting time in searching for novelties and hazardous theories while overlooking the good , safe and tried means -atti_degli_apostoli- hand . Again , perhaps it may propose institutions and methods belonging to other times but no longer understood by the people of the present_day . Or , finally , it may go only half way , failing to use , in the measure in which_they_are granted , those civil rights which modern constitutions today offer all , and therefore also Catholics . In particular , the present constitution of states offers indiscriminately to all the right to influence public opinion , and Catholics , with due respect_for the obligations imposed by the law of God and the precepts of the Church , can certainly use this to their advantage . In such_a_way they_can prove themselves as capable as others in fact , more capable than others by cooperating in the material and civil welfare of the people . In so doing they_shall acquire that authority and prestige which_will make_them capable of defending and promoting a higher good , namely_,_that of the soul . These civil rights are of various kinds , even to the extent of directly participating in the political_life of the country by representing the people in the legislative halls . Most serious reasons , however , dissuade Us , Venerable Brethren , from departing from that norm which Our Predecessor , Leo XIII , of blessed memory , decreed during his Pontificate . According to his decree it was universally forbidden in Italy for Catholics to participate in the legislative power . Other reasons equally grave , however , founded upon the supreme good of society_which must be preserved -atti_degli_apostoli- all costs demand_that in particular cases a dispensation from the law be granted especially_when you , Venerable Brethren , recognize_the strict necessity of it for the good of souls and the interest of your churches , and you request such a dispensation . This concession places a duty on all Catholics to prepare themselves prudently and seriously for political_life in case they_may be called to it . Hence it -isaia- of the utmost importance that the same activity previously so praiseworthily planned by Catholics for the purpose of preparing themselves by means of good electoral organization for the administrative life of common and provincial councils be extended to a suitable preparation and organization for political_life . This was already recommended by the Circular of December , , issued by the general Presidency of Economic Works in Italy . At the same_time the other principles_which regulate the conscience of every true Catholic must be inculcated and put into_practice . Above all else he must remember to be and to act in every circumstance as a true Catholic , accepting and fulfilling public offices with the firm and constant resolution of promoting by every_means the social_and_economic welfare of the country and particularly of the people , according to the maxims of a truly Christian civilization , and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time defending the supreme interests of the Church , which are_those of religion and justice . Such , Venerable Brethren , are the characteristics , the aim and conditions of Catholic Action , considered in its most important function , namely , the solution of the social_question . For that_reason it demands the most energetic attention of all the Catholic forces . By no means , however , does this exclude the existence of other activities nor_does it mean_that other organizations should_not flourish and be promoted , for each_one -isaia-_directed to different particular goods of society and of the people . All are_united in the work of restoring Christian civilization under its various aspects . These works , rising out of the zeal of particular persons , spreading throughout many dioceses , are sometimes grouped into federations . Since the end they foster -isaia- praiseworthy , the Christian principles they follow solid , and the means they adopt just , they_are to be praised and encouraged in every way . At the same_time , they_must be permitted a certain freedom of organization since_it_-isaia- impossible for so many_people to be formed in the same mold and placed under the same direction . Organization , therefore , must arise spontaneously from the works themselves , otherwise it will only be an ephemeral building of fine architecture , but lacking a solid foundation and therefore quite unstable . Particular characteristics of different people must_also be taken into consideration . Different uses , different tendencies are_found in different places . It -isaia- of primary importance that the work be built on a good foundation of solid principles and maintained with earnestness and constancy . If this_-isaia- the case , the method used and the form the various works take will be accidental . In order to renew and increase in all the Catholic works necessary enthusiasm ; in order to offer an occasion for the promoters and members of these works to see each_other and become better acquainted ; in order to strengthen the bond of charity , to inspire one_another with a great zeal for fruitful activity , and to provide_for the greater solidity and propagation of the works themselves , it will be very useful from time to time to hold general and particular Congresses of Italian Catholics , according to the norms already laid_down by this Holy See . These Congresses , however , must be a solemn manifestation of the Catholic Faith and a festival of mutual harmony and peace . We must touch , Venerable Brethren , on another point of extreme importance , namely , the relation of all the works of Catholic Action to ecclesiastical authority . If the teachings unfolded in the first part of this_letter are thoughtfully considered it will be readily seen that all those works which directly come to the aid of the spiritual and pastoral_ministry of the Church and which labor religiously for the good of souls must in every least thing be subordinated to the authority of the Church and also to the authority of the Bishops placed by the Holy Spirit to rule_the Church of God in the dioceses assigned to them . Moreover , the other works which , as We have_said , are primarily designed for the restoration and promotion of true Christian civilization and which , as explained above , constitute Catholic Action , by no means may be considered as independent of the counsel and direction of ecclesiastical authority , especially since_they must all conform to the principles of Christian faith and morality . At the same_time it -isaia- impossible to imagine them as in opposition , more_or_less openly , to that_same authority . Such works , however , by their_very nature , should be directed with a reasonable degree of freedom , since responsible action -isaia-_especially theirs in the temporal and economic affairs as well as in those matters of public administration and political_life . These affairs are alien to the purely spiritual ministry . Since Catholics , on the other_hand , are to raise always the banner of Christ , by that_very fact they_also raise the banner of the Church . Thus it -isaia- no more_than right that_they receive it from the hands of the Church , that the Church guard its immaculate honor , and that Catholics submit as docile , loving children to this maternal vigilance . For these reasons it -isaia- evident how terribly wrong those few were who in Italy , and under Our very eyes , wanted to undertake a mission which_they received neither from Us nor from any of Our Brethren in the episcopate . They promoted it not_only without due homage to authority but_even openly against the will of that authority , seeking to rationalize their disobedience by foolish distinctions . They said_that they_were undertaking their cause in the name of Christ ; but such a cause could_not be Christ s since it was_not built on the doctrine of the Divine Redeemer . How truly these_words apply : '' He who hears you , hears me ; and he who rejects you , rejects me . '' '' He who_-isaia- not_with me -isaia- against me ; and he who_does_not gather with me scatters . '' This -isaia- a doctrine of humility , submission , filial respect . With extreme regret We had to condemn this tendency and halt by Our authority this pernicious movement which_was rapidly gaining momentum . Our sorrow was increased when We saw many young_people of excellent character and fervent zeal and capable of performing much good if properly directed , and who are_also very dear to Us , carelessly attracted to such an erroneous program . While pointing out the true nature of Catholic Action , Venerable Brethren , We cannot minimize the grave danger to which_the clergy may find_themselves exposed because of the conditions of the time . They may attach such importance to the material interests of the people that_they_will forget those more_important duties of the sacred_ministry . The priest , raised above all men in order to accomplish the mission he has from God , must_also remain above all human interests , all conflicts , all classes of society . His proper field of action -isaia- the Church . There , as ambassador of God , he preaches the truth , teaching along with_respect for the rights of God respect also_for the rights of every_creature . In such a work he neither exposes himself to any opposition nor appears as a man of factions , ally to one group and adversary to others . In such_a_way he will_not place himself in the danger of dissimulating the truth , of keeping silence in the conflict of certain tendencies , or of irritating exasperated souls by repeated arguments . In all these cases he would fail in his real duty . It -isaia- unnecessary to add that while treating so often of material affairs he may find himself obligated to perform tasks harmful to himself and to the dignity of his office . He may take_part in these associations , therefore , only after mature deliberation , with the consent of his Bishop , and then only in those cases when his assistance will be free_from every danger and will be obviously useful . This does_not diminish his zeal . The true apostle must make himself '' all things to all men '' in order to save all . Like the Divine Redeemer , he ought to be moved with compassion , '' seeing the crowds . bewildered and dejected , like sheep without a shepherd . '' By means of the printed and spoken word , by direct participation in the above mentioned cases , he can labor on behalf of the people according to the principles of justice and charity by favoring and promoting those institutions which propose to protect the masses from the invasion of Socialism , saving them -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time from both economic ruin and moral and religious chaos . In this_way the assistance of the clergy in the works of Catholic Action has a truly religious purpose . It will then not be a hindrance , but_rather a help , to the spiritual ministry by enlarging its sphere and multiplying its results . You see now , Venerable Brethren , how_much We have desired to explain and inculcate these_principles concerning Catholic Action which_-isaia- to be sustained and promoted in Italy . It -isaia- not sufficient to point_out the good ; it also must be put into_practice . Your own exhortations and paternal interest will render an inestimable service to the cause . Although the beginnings are humble , as -isaia- the case in all beginnings , divine_grace will cause it to grow and prosper in a short time . All Our children who dedicate themselves to Catholic Action should once_again listen to the advice which arises so spontaneously from Our heart . Amid the bitter sorrows which daily surround Us , We will say with Saint Paul , '' if . there_-isaia- any comfort in Christ , any encouragement from charity , any fellowship in the Spirit , any feelings of mercy , fill up my joy by thinking alike , having the same charity , with one soul and one mind . Do nothing out of contentiousness or out of vainglory , but in humility let each_one regard the others as his superiors , each_one looking not to his_own interests but to those of others . Have this mind in you which_was also in Christ Jesus . '' Let Him be the beginning of all your undertakings : '' Whatever you do in word or in work , do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ . '' Let Him be the end of your every word : '' For from him and through_him and unto him are all things . To him be the glory forever . '' On this_day which_-isaia- so reminiscent of that_when the Apostles , full of the Holy Spirit , went out of the Cenacle to preach to the world_the Kingdom of Christ , may the power of that_same Spirit descend upon all of you . '' May He bend whatever_-isaia- rigid , inflame whatever has grown cold , and bring back whatever has gone astray . May the Apostolic Blessing which We impart from the bottom of Our heart to you , Venerable Brethren , and your_clergy and the Italian people , be a sign of divine favor and a pledge of Our very_special affection .
