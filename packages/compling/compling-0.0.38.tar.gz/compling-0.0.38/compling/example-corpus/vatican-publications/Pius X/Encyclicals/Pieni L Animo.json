Our soul -isaia- fearful of the strict rendering that We shall one_day be called_upon to make to Jesus Christ , the Prince of Pastors , concerning the flock He entrusted to Our care . We pass each_day with_great solicitude in preserving as much as possible the faithful from the dangerous evils that afflict society -atti_degli_apostoli- the present_time . Therefore , We consider addressed to Us the words of the Prophet : '' Cry , cease not , lift up thy voice like a trumpet . '' Accordingly , sometimes by speech and sometimes by letter We constantly warn , beseech , and censure , arousing , above all , the zeal of Our Brethren in the Episcopate so that_each one of them will exercise the most solicitous vigilance in that portion of the flock over which_the Holy Spirit has placed him . The cause which now moves Us to raise Our voice -isaia- of very serious importance . It demands all the attention of your mind and all the energy of your pastoral_office to counteract the disorder which has_already produced the most destructive effects . If this disorder -isaia- not radically removed with a firm hand , even_more fatal consequences will be felt in the coming years . In fact , Venerable Brethren , We have letters , full of sadness and tears , from several of you , in which_you deplore the spirit of insubordination and independence displayed here and there among the clergy . Most assuredly , a poisonous atmosphere corrupts men s minds to a great extent today , and the deadly effects are those_which the Apostolic Saint Jude formerly described : '' These men also defile the flesh , disregard authority , deride majesty . '' That -isaia- to say , over and above the most degrading corruption of manners there_-isaia-_also an open contempt for authority and for those_who exercise it . What overwhelms Us with grief , however , -isaia- the fact_that this_spirit should creep into the sanctuary even in the least degree , infecting those_to_whom the words of Ecclesiasticus should most fittingly be applied : '' Their generation , obedience and love . '' This unfortunate spirit_-isaia- doing the damage especially among young priests , spreading among_them new and reprehensible theories concerning the very nature of obedience . In order to recruit new members for_this growing troop of rebels , what_-isaia- even more_serious -isaia- the fact_that such maxims are_being more_or_less secretly propagated among youths preparing for the priesthood within_the enclosure of the seminaries . We therefore consider it Our duty , Venerable Brethren , to appeal to your conscience to see_that you do not spare any effort and with a firm hand and constant resolve you do not_hesitate to destroy this evil seed which carries with it such destructive consequences . Never forget_that the Holy Spirit has placed you to rule . Remember Saint Paul s command to Titus : '' Rebuke with all authority . Let no one despise thee . '' Be firm in demanding that obedience from your priests and clerics which -isaia-_a_matter of absolute obligation for all the faithful , and constitutes the most important part of the sacred duty of priests . Take the proper means necessary_for the diminution of these quarrelsome souls . Bear well in mind , Venerable Brethren , the Apostle s warning to Timothy : '' Do not lay hands hastily upon anyone . '' In fact , haste in admitting men to Sacred Orders naturally opens the way to a multiplication of people in the sanctuary who_do_not increase joy . We know that_there are cities and dioceses where , far from there being any reason to lament the dearth of clergy , the clergy greatly exceed the needs of the faithful . Venerable Brethren , what reason -isaia- there for imposing hands so frequently ? In those places_where the lack of clergy -isaia- no sufficient reason_for haste in so important a matter and the clergy are_more numerous than the requirements demand , nothing excuses from the most delicate caution and the greatest exactitude in selecting those_who_are to receive the sacerdotal honor . The eagerness of the aspirants -isaia- no excuse for haste . The priesthood that Jesus Christ instituted for the salvation_of_souls -isaia- by no means a human profession or office which anyone desiring it for_any reason can say he has a right to receive . Therefore , let_the Bishops call young_men to sacred orders , not according to the desires or pretexts of the aspirants , but , as the Council of Trent prescribes , according to the needs of the dioceses . In this_task they_can select only those_who_are really suitable and dismiss those_who_have inclinations contrary to the priestly vocation . The most dangerous of these inclinations are a disregard for discipline and that pride of mind which fosters it . In order_that young_men who display qualities suitable for the sacred_ministry may_not be lacking , Venerable Brethren , We wish to insist most earnestly on what We have_already frequently pointed_out . That -isaia- to say , you_have a very serious obligation before God of guarding and fostering most solicitously the proper conduct of the seminaries . Your priests will be as you_have trained them . The letter of December , , which Our most prudent Predecessor addressed to you as a testament from his long Pontificate -isaia- very_important . We desire to add nothing new to it ; We shall merely remind you of the rules it lays down . We especially recommend the immediate execution of Our orders , published through the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars , on the concentration of the seminaries especially_for the study of philosophy and theology . In this_way the great advantage resulting from the separation of the major and minor seminaries and the no less great advantage of the necessary instruction of the clergy will be secured . Let the seminaries be jealously guarded in order_that a proper atmosphere will be maintained . Let them always be destined exclusively for preparing youths , not_for civil careers , but_for the noble vocation of being ministers of Christ . Let philosophy , theology , and the related sciences , especially Sacred Scripture , be studied along the lines of pontifical directives : according to the teaching of Saint Thomas which Our venerable Predecessor so often recommended , and We Ourselves recommended in the Apostolic Letter of January , . Therefore , let_the Bishops exercise the most prudent vigilance towards_the professors teachings . Let them recall those_who run after certain dangerous novelties to their sense of duty . If they_do_not profit from_these warnings , let_them be removed cost what it may from their teaching position . Young clerics are forbidden to frequent the universities unless the Bishops think there_are very good reasons and necessary precautions have_been taken . Seminarians are absolutely forbidden to take_part in external activities . We forbid them to read newspapers and periodicals , excepting , in the case of the latter , those with solid principles and which_the Bishop deems suitable for their study . Let discipline continue to be fostered with renewed vigor and vigilance . Finally , in every seminary there_must be a spiritual director . He -isaia- to be a man of extraordinary prudence and experienced in the ways of Christian perfection . With untiring zeal he must train the young_men in solid piety , the primary foundation of the spiritual_life . Venerable Brethren , if these rules are conscientiously and religiously followed they_will be your sure guarantee of seeing a clergy growing up around you which_will be your joy and your crown . If these instructions are_not observed , the problem of insubordination and independence which We now lament will be even_more aggravated by some of the younger clergy and cause even_more harm . This -isaia-_especially so since those_who_are subject to this reprobate spirit are_not lacking , and , abusing the sacred office of preaching , they_are its outspoken promoters and apostles , to the detriment and scandal of the faithful . On July , , Our Predecessor , through the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars , called the Bishops attention to this_very serious problem . The regulations and norms set up in that Pontifical document We now affirm and renew , commanding the Bishops to form their conscience according to it , lest the words of the Prophet Nahum might be applied to any of them : '' Thy shepherds have slumbered . '' No one_can have_the faculty of preaching '' unless he first be approved of in life , knowledge and morals . '' Priests of other dioceses should_not be allowed to preach unless they_have testimonial letters from their_own Bishop . Let the subject of their sermons be that_which the Divine Savior indicated when He said : '' Preach the gospel . teaching them to observe all that I commanded you . '' Or , according to the Council of Trent , '' announcing to them the vices they_should avoid and the virtues they_should follow in order to escape eternal punishment and attain heavenly glory . '' Therefore , let those arguments better suited to journalistic campaigns and lecture halls be completely banished from the holy place . Let moral preaching be preferred to sermons which_are , to say the least , fruitless . Let the preacher speak '' not in the persuasive words of wisdom , but in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power . '' The principal source , therefore , from which preaching will derive its strength will be the Sacred Scriptures , understood not according to the private judgment of minds very frequently blinded by passions , but according to the traditions of the Church and the interpretations of the holy Fathers and Councils . According to these rules , Venerable Brethren , you_should judge those_to_whom you will entrust the ministry of the divine_word . Whenever you find any of them departing from_these rules , being more concerned_with their_own interests than those of Jesus Christ and more anxious for worldly applause than the welfare of souls , warn and correct them . If that proves insufficient , be firm in removing them_from an office for which_they_have proven themselves unworthy . You should be especially diligent in employing this vigilance and severity since_the ministry of preaching belongs in a special_way to you , and -isaia- one of the chief functions of the Episcopal Office . Whoever outside your rank preaches , he does so only in your name and in your place . It follows , therefore_,_that you_are always responsible before God for the way_in_which the bread of the divine word_-isaia- distributed to the faithful . In order to remove all responsibility from Our shoulders , We notice and command all Ordinaries to discontinue or suspend , after charitable warnings , any preacher , be he secular or regular , and even if it be during a course of sermons , who_does_not completely obey the regulations laid_down in the above mentioned Instruction of the Congregation of Bishops and Regulars . Better by far would it be if the faithful were satisfied with the simple homilies and explanations of the Catechism their parish priests offer them than to attend sermons that do more harm than good . Another field where_the junior clergy find a wide scope and great stimulus for maintaining and advocating exemption from every bond of legitimate authority_-isaia- the so called Popular Christian Action . This action , Venerable Brethren , -isaia- not in itself reprehensible , nor by its_nature does it lead to contempt of authority . Many , however , misunderstanding its_nature , have voluntarily abandoned the rules laid_down for its promotion by Our Predecessor of immortal memory . You are aware_that We are referring to the Instruction on Popular Christian Action which , by command of Leo XIII , the Sacred Congregation of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs issued on January , , and which_was sent to each_one of you to carry_out in your dioceses . For Our part , We maintain and , with the fullness of Our power , We renew these instructions with each_and_every one of their regulations . Similarly We confirm and renew all the orders We issued in the motu_proprio of December , , on Popular Christian Action along_with the Circular Letter dated July , , of Our beloved son , the Cardinal Secretary of State . Concerning the founding and directing of newspapers and periodicals , the clergy must faithfully follow Article of the Apostolic Constitution Officiorum , namely , '' Clerics are forbidden to direct newspapers or periodicals without_the previous consent of the Ordinaries . '' Similarly , without_the previous consent of the Ordinary , no cleric can publish any_kind of writing , be it concerned_with a religious , moral , or merely technical subject . Before the founding of circles and societies their rules and constitutions must be examined and approved by the Ordinary . No priest or cleric can lecture on Popular Christian Action or any_other subject without_the permission of the Ordinary of the place . Language which might inspire aversion for the higher classes -isaia- , and can_only be regarded as , altogether contrary to the true spirit of Christian charity . Likewise , all terms smacking of an unhealthy novelty in Catholic publications are condemnable , such as those deriding the piety of the faithful , or pointing out a new orientation of the Christian life , new directions of the Church , new aspirations of the modern soul , a new social vocation of the clergy , or a new Christian civilization . While it -isaia- a very praiseworthy thing for the clergy , and especially_the younger clergy , to go to the people , nevertheless , they_must proceed in this_matter with due obedience to authority and the commands of their ecclesiastical superiors . In devoting themselves according to this submission to the cause of Popular Christian Action , their noble duty must be '' to rescue the children of the people from ignorance of spiritual and eternal things , encouraging them by their kindness to live honestly and virtuously ; to strengthen adults in the faith , fortifying them in the practice of the Christian life by removing all contrary influences ; to foster among the Catholic laity those institutions which_are really instrumental in improving the moral and material welfare of the masses ; and above all , to defend the principles of evangelical justice and charity , applying equally to everyone the rights_and_duties of civil_society . Let them , moreover , be ever mindful that_even among the people the priest should inviolately preserve his novel character as a minister of God , being placed -atti_degli_apostoli- the head of his brethren for their salvation . In devoting himself to the people should he do anything contrary to the dignity of the priesthood or ecclesiastical duties or discipline , he must be rebuked . Moreover , Venerable Brethren , in order to erect an effective bulwark against this extravagance of thought and extension of the spirit of independence , by Our authority , We absolutely forbid all clerics and priests to give their names in the future to any society that does_not have Episcopal approbation . In a very_special manner , under penalty of exclusion from Sacred Orders for clerics and suspension ipso facto a divinis for priests , We forbid them to become members of the National Democratic League , whose program was issued from Roma Torrette on October , . Its statutes were published the same year by the Provisional Committee of Bologna without_the name of their author . Being concerned about the present state of the Italian clergy and the importance of the subject , the solicitude of Our Apostolic Office demanded Us to issue these directives . We must now once_again arouse your zeal , Venerable Brethren , in order_that these arrangements and regulations will be quickly and fully carried_out in your dioceses . Prevent the evil where fortunately it has not_yet appeared . Suppress it immediately where it -isaia- beginning to spring up . Wipe it out with a firm and resolute hand where unfortunately it has_already ripened . Making this a matter of conscience for you , We pray that God will fill you with the spirit of prudence and necessary firmness . For that_reason , from the bottom of Our heart , We impart to you the Apostolic Blessing . Given -atti_degli_apostoli- Saint Peter s , Rome , on July , , the third year of Our Pontificate .
