Indeed from her very beginnings she never ceased to make sure_that the Christian people might enjoy_the fullest possible opportunity of receiving the word of God , especially in the sacred Liturgy , in the celebration of which '' the importance of Sacred Scripture -isaia-_very great '' Conc . Therefore in the regions of the West the Church has preferred to the others that edition which_-isaia- usually called the Vulgate and which , composed for the most part by the excellent teacher Saint Jerome , has_been '' confirmed in the Church herself by the usage of so many centuries '' Conc . As a proof of such a great esteem there_-isaia-_also her concern_for preparing a text according to critical methodology , and precisely by means of the edition which_-isaia- still being arranged along scientific guidelines by the monks of the Abbey of Saint Jerome in Rome founded for that purpose by our predecessor_of_happy_memory Pius XI Const . Inter Praecipuas , June ; A . However in our own_time the Second Vatican Council , while confirming the respect given to that edition which people call the Vulgate Const . and while striving zealously so that the understanding of the Psalter in the Liturgy of the Hours might be made easier , decreed that the successfully initiated work of revising it '' should be terminated as soon as possible . It shall take into_account_the style of Christian Latinity as well as the entire tradition of the Latin Church '' Sacrosanctum Concilium , n . Our predecessor of recent memory , Paul VI , was moved by all these considerations to set up even before the end of the same Council , that_-isaia- on November , a special Pontifical Commission whose task it would be to carry_out the command of the same General Council and to revise all the books of Sacred Scripture so that the Church might be enriched with a Latin edition which advancing biblical studies demanded and which might serve especially in the Liturgy . In realizing this revision , '' the old text of the Vulgate edition was taken into consideration word for word , namely , whenever the original texts are accurately rendered , such as they are_found in modern critical editions ; however the text was prudently improved , whenever it departs from them or interprets them less correctly . For this_reason Christian biblical Latinity was used so that a just evaluation of tradition might be properly combined with the legitimate demands of critical science prevailing in these times '' cf . Address of Paul VI , December ; A . The text born out of this revision which , indeed , was quite demanding in certain books of the Old Testament which Saint Jerome did_not touch was published in separate volumes from to ; but now it -isaia- being offered in a '' typical '' edition contained in one volume . This New Vulgate edition will_also be of such a nature that vernacular translations , which_are destined for liturgical and pastoral use , may be referred to it ; and , to use the words of our predecessor Paul VI , '' it -isaia- permissible to think that_it_-isaia- a certain sort of foundation on which biblical studies . may rest , especially where libraries open to special studies can be consulted only with_greater difficulty , and where_the diffusion of suitable research materials -isaia- more hindered '' cf . daily L Osservatore Romano , December , p . In past times the Church considered that the old Vulgate edition was sufficient and was abundantly effective for sharing the word of God with the Christian people : something indeed which_this New Vulgate edition will_be_able to accomplish all the more_fully . Consequently we are_now happy to entrust to the Church the printed work_which Paul VI greatly desired but was unable to see completely finished , which_was followed up with enthusiastic support by John Paul I who_had decided to send the books of the Pentateuch , revised by the aforementioned Pontifical Commission , as a gift to the Bishops about to meet in the city of Puebla , and which work we ourself together_with many_people from the Catholic world have ardently awaited . These things being so , by virtue of this Letter we declare the New Vulgate edition of the Holy Bible as '' typical '' and we promulgate it to be used especially in the sacred Liturgy but_also as suitable for other_things , as we have_said . Finally we decree that_this Constitution of ours be firm and forever efficacious and be scrupulously observed by all concerned , notwithstanding any obstacles whatsoever .
