{"title": "IV Cent Union Brest", "author": "John Paul II", "type_of_text": "Apost_letters", "pub_date": "12/11/1995", "text": "APOSTOLIC LETTEROF THE SUPREME PONTIFFJOHN PAUL IIFOR THE FOURTH CENTENARYOF THE UNION OF BREST Dear Brothers and Sisters ! The day -isaia- drawing near when_the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church will celebrate the fourth centenary of the union between_the Bishops of the Metropolia of Kievan Rus and the Apostolic See . The union was effected -atti_degli_apostoli- the meeting of representatives of the Metropolia of Kiev with the Pope on December and was solemnly proclaimed -atti_degli_apostoli- Brest Litovsk on the River Bug on October . Pope Clement VIII , in the Apostolic Constitution Magnus Dominus et laudabilis nimis , announced the union to the whole Church and in the Apostolic Letter Benedictus sit Pastor he addressed the Bishops of the Metropolia , informing them that the union had taken_place . The Popes followed with care and affection the often tragic and sorrowful journey of this Church . Here I would_like to mention especially_the memorable Encyclical Letter Orientales omnes , in which Pope Pius XII , in December , recalled the th anniversary of the restoration of full_communion with the See of Rome . The Union of Brest opened a new page in the history of the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine . Today that Church wishes to sing with_joy a hymn of thanksgiving and praise to the One who , once_more , has brought it back from death to life , and it wishes to set_forth with renewed enthusiasm on the path marked out by the Second Vatican Council . Joining the faithful of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in this thanksgiving and petition are the Greek Catholic Churches of the diaspora which date back to the Union of Brest , together_with_the other Eastern Catholic Churches and the entire Church . As the Bishop of Rome , I too wish to unite myself to the Catholics of the Byzantine tradition in those lands . For many years , during my pastoral_ministry in Poland , I sensed a physical as well as a spiritual closeness with_that Church , which_was then undergoing such difficult trials . After my election to the See of Peter , I considered it a pressing duty , following_the_example of my Predecessors , to speak out in defence of its right to exist and freely to profess its faith , -atti_degli_apostoli- a time_when both these rights were being denied . I now have_the privilege of joyfully sharing in its celebration of these_days of regained freedom . The celebrations commemorating the Union of Brest must be seen in the context of the Millennium of the Baptism of the Rus . Seven years_ago , in , that event was celebrated with_great solemnity . For the occasion I published two documents : the Apostolic Letter Euntes in mundum of January , for the whole Church , and the Message Magnum Baptismi donum , of February of the same year , addressed to Ukrainian Catholics . It was an occasion for celebrating a moment of fundamental importance for the Christian and cultural identity of those peoples , a moment of unique significance , since -atti_degli_apostoli- that_time the Churches of the Byzantine tradition and the Church of Rome were still living in full_communion . After the division which damaged the unity between_the West and the Byzantine East , frequent and intense efforts were made to restore full_communion . I wish to mention two particularly significant events : the Second Council of Lyons in , and above all the Council of Florence in , when protocols of union with the Eastern Churches were signed . Unfortunately , various causes prevented the promise and potential of those agreements from being realized . The Bishops of the Metropolia of Kiev , in restoring communion with Rome , made explicit reference to the decisions of the Council of Florence , a Council which_had numbered among its participants representatives from the Patriarchate of Constantinople . In this_context , the figure of Metropolitan Isidore of Kiev stands out . As a faithful interpreter and defender of the decisions of that Council , he had to endure exile for his convictions . The Bishops who promoted the union and the members of their Church retained a lively awareness of their original close ties to their Orthodox brethren , together_with a full consciousness of the Oriental identity of their Metropolia , an identity which_was also to be upheld after_the union . In the history of the Catholic Church , it -isaia- a highly significant fact_that this just desire was respected and that the act of union did_not involve passing over to the Latin tradition , as some thought would happen . Their Church saw an acknowledgment of its right to be governed by its_own hierarchy with a specific discipline and to maintain its Eastern liturgical and spiritual heritage . Between persecutionand growth . After the union , the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church enjoyed a period in which its ecclesiastical structures flourished , with resulting benefits for religious_life , the education of the clergy and the spiritual commitment of the faithful . With remarkable farsightedness , great_importance was attached to education . Thanks to the valuable contribution of the Basilian Order and other Religious Congregations , there_was a great growth in the study of the sacred sciences and the nation s culture . In the present century , a figure of extraordinary prestige , in this_regard as well as in his witness of suffering borne for Christ , was Metropolitan Andrii Sheptyckyi , whose education and fine spiritual qualities were combined with outstanding organizational gifts . He founded schools and academies , supported theological studies and the human sciences , the press and sacred art , and sought to preserve historical memories . And yet , all this ecclesial vitality was continually marked by the tragedy of misunderstanding and opposition . An illustrious victim in this_regard was_the Archbishop of Polock and Vitebsk , Josaphat Kuntsevych , whose martyrdom merited the unfading crown of eternal glory . His body now lies in the Vatican Basilica , where it -isaia- continuously venerated with devotion and gratitude by Catholics from throughout_the_world . The difficulties and trials continued unabated . Pope Pius XII recalled them in the Encyclical Letter Orientales omnes . After describing the earlier persecutions , he predicted the tragic persecution which_would take_place under the atheistic regime . Outstanding among the heroic witnesses to the rights not_only of the faith but_also of human conscience in those difficult years -isaia- the figure of Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj : his courage in enduring exile and prison for years and his indomitable confidence in the resurrection of his Church make him one_of_the_most powerful figures among the confessors of the faith in our_time . Nor should his many companions in punishment be forgotten , particularly Bishops Hryhory Khomyshyn and Josaphat Kocylowskyj . These tempestuous events shook the Church in the homeland to its roots . But Divine Providence had_already begun to make it possible_for many of its_members to find a way of escape for themselves and their_people . From the beginning of the th century onwards , great waves of emigrants began to cross the ocean , settling above all in Canada , the United States of America , Brazil , Argentina and Australia . The Holy See took care to be close to them , by providing assistance and establishing pastoral structures for them in their new homes , including the establishment of their_own Eparchies . At the time of trial , during the atheistic persecution in their native land , the voice of these believers could thus be raised , in full freedom , with strength and courage . In the international forum they defended the right of their persecuted brethren to religious_freedom , and thus strengthened the Second Vatican Council s appeal for religious_freedom , and the efforts made in this_regard by the Holy See . The whole Catholic Community recalls with deep emotion the victims of such_great suffering : the martyrs and confessors of the faith of the Church in Ukraine offer us a magnificent lesson in fidelity even -atti_degli_apostoli- the price of life_itself . And we , the favoured witnesses of their sacrifice , are aware_that they helped to maintain the dignity of a world_which seemed overwhelmed by atrocities . They knew the truth , and the truth set them free . Christians in Europe and throughout_the_world , pausing in prayer before the concentration camps and prisons , should be grateful for the light_which they gave : it was_the light of Christ , which_they caused to shine in the darkness . For long years the darkness seemed in the eyes of the world to prevail , but it was_not able to extinguish that light , which_was the light of God and the light of man , wounded but_not laid low . This inheritance of suffering and glory today stands -atti_degli_apostoli- a historic crossroads : now that the chains of imprisonment have_been broken , the Greek Catholic Church in Ukraine has begun again to breathe in freedom and to regain fully its_own active role in the Church and in history . This task , difficult yet providential , today calls for particular reflection , that_it_may be carried_out with wisdom and farsightedness . In the wake of the Second Vatican Council . The celebration of the Union of Brest should be lived and interpreted in the light of the teachings of the Second Vatican Council . This -isaia- perhaps the most important aspect for understanding the significance of the anniversary . It -isaia- well_known that the Second Vatican Council made a special point of studying the mystery of the Church , and that one_of_the_most important documents which it produced was_the Constitution Lumen gentium . Precisely because of this detailed study the Council takes on a particular ecumenical significance . This -isaia- confirmed by the Decree Unitatis redintegratio , which presents a very enlightened programme of activities to be carried_out in the work_for Christian unity . Thirty years after_the conclusion of the Council , I wished to reiterate this programme with my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint , published on May of this_year . This Encyclical traces the ecumenical progress which_has_been made since_the Second Vatican Council and , -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , looking to the third_millennium of the Christian era , it seeks to open up new possibilities for the future . Putting the celebrations of the coming year in the context of a reflection on the Church , as proposed by the Council , I -amos- anxious above all to encourage a deeper_understanding of the proper role which_the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church -isaia- called to play today in the ecumenical movement . There are_those_who see the existence of the Eastern Catholic Churches as a difficulty on the road of ecumenism . The Second Vatican Council did not_fail to face this problem , indicating possibilities for solutions both in the Decree on Ecumenism Unitatis redintegratio , and in the Decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum , which_was specifically dedicated to these Churches . Both documents reflect a spirit of ecumenical dialogue_with_the Eastern Churches not in full_communion with the See of Rome , in such_a_way_that the richness which_the other Churches share_with the Catholic Church can be appreciated , and that the quest for an ever fuller and deeper communion may be founded on this shared richness . In fact , '' ecumenism -isaia-_directed precisely to making the partial communion existing between Christians grow towards full_communion in truth and charity '' . To promote dialogue_with_the Byzantine Orthodox Churches , there_was set up , after_the Second Vatican Council , a special Mixed Commission which also included among its_members representatives of the Eastern Catholic Churches . In various documents efforts have been_made to arrive -atti_degli_apostoli- a deeper and greater understanding between_the Orthodox Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches , efforts which_have not_been without positive results . In my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen and in my Encyclical Letter Ut unum sint I have_already written of the elements of sanctification and truth common to Eastern and Western Christianity , and of the desirable path to follow in the search_for full communion_between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Churches , in the light of the greater ecclesiological understanding brought_about by the Second Vatican Council : '' Today we know that_unity can be achieved through the love of God only if the Churches want it together , in full respect_for the traditions of each and for necessary autonomy . We know_that this_can take_place only on the basis of the love of Churches which feel increasingly called to manifest the one Church of Christ , born from one Baptism and from one Eucharist , and which want to be sisters '' . The deepening of knowledge of the doctrine on the Church , brought_about by the Council and continuing since_the Council , has marked out what can be called a new path on the journey to unity : the path of the dialogue of truth nourished and sustained by the dialogue of charity cf . The shift from an underground existence has meant a radical change in the situation of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church : this Church has found itself facing the grave problems of rebuilding the structures of which it had_been completely deprived and , more generally , it has had to commit itself to rediscovering itself fully , not_only from within , but_also in relation to the other Churches . Thanks be to God for having enabled it to celebrate this jubilee with religious_freedom regained . Thanks be to God also_for the growth of the dialogue of charity , whereby significant progress has been_made on the road to the much desired reconciliation with the Orthodox Churches . Numerous migrations and deportations have redrawn the religious geography of those lands ; many years of official State atheism have profoundly affected people s minds ; there_-isaia- still not_enough clergy to respond to the immense needs of religious and moral reconstruction : these_are some of the more dramatic challenges facing all of the Churches . In the face of these difficulties a common witness of charity_-isaia- required , in order_that the proclamation of the Gospel may_not be impeded . As I said in my Apostolic Letter Orientale lumen , '' today we can co operate in proclaiming the Kingdom or we can become the upholders of new divisions '' . May the Lord guide our feet into the way of peace . The blood of the martyrs . In the new found freedom we cannot forget the persecution and martyrdom which_the Churches of that region , both Catholic and Orthodox , suffered in their_own flesh . This -isaia- an important aspect for the Church of all times , as I recalled in my Apostolic Letter Tertio millennio adveniente . It concerns a particularly significant heritage of the Churches of Europe , which remain profoundly marked by it : this needs to be studied in the light of the Word of God . An integral part of this religious memory of ours -isaia- therefore the duty to call to mind the meaning of martyrdom , to propose the actual figures of those witnesses of faith to the veneration of everyone , in the awareness_that even today the saying of Tertullian retains its_full meaning : '' Sanguis martyrum , semen Christianorum '' . We Christians already have a common martyrology in which God maintains and brings about communion among the baptized by the supreme demand of faith , manifested in the sacrifice of life_itself . Real , if imperfect communion , already present between Catholics and Orthodox in their ecclesial life , reaches perfection in all that we '' consider_the highest point of the life of grace , martyria unto death , the truest communion possible with Christ who shed his Blood , and by that sacrifice brings near those_who once were far off cf . Remembrance of the martyrs cannot be erased from the memory of the Church or of humanity : whether victims of the ideologies of the East or of the West , all of them are brought together in fellowship by the violence whereby hatred for the faith violated the dignity_of_the_human_person , created by God '' in his image_and_likeness '' . The Church of Christ -isaia- one . '' Credo unam , sanctam , catholicam et apostolicam Ecclesiam '' . This profession_of_faith contained in the Nicene Constantinopolitan Creed -isaia- common to both Catholic and Orthodox Christians : it emphasizes not_only that_they believe in the unity of the Church , but also_that they live and wish to live in the one and indivisible Church as it was founded by Jesus Christ . The differences between Christianity in the East and in the West which arose and developed in the course of history are for the most part diversities of cultural origin and of tradition . In this_sense , '' legitimate diversity -isaia- in no way opposed to the Church s unity , but_rather enhances her splendour and contributes greatly to the fulfilment of her_mission '' . Pope John XXIII was fond of repeating : '' What unites us -isaia- much greater_than what divides us '' . I -amos- convinced_that this attitude can be a great benefit to all the Churches . More than years have gone by since_the Pope made this statement . In this period of time there have_been many indications which suggest to us that Christians have_made progress in this direction . Eloquent signs of this progress have_been the fraternal meetings between Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I , and those_which I myself have_had with the Ecumenical Patriarchs Dimitrios and , more recently , Bartholomaios , and with_other venerable Patriarchs of the Churches of the East . All this , together_with_the many initiatives involving meetings and dialogue which are_being promoted everywhere in the Church , encourages us to have hope : the Holy Spirit , the Spirit of unity , does not_cease to work among Christians still separated_from one_another . And yet human weakness and sin continue to resist the Spirit of unity . Sometimes one even has the impression that_there are forces ready to do almost anything in order to slow down , and even put an end to , the movement towards Christian unity . But we cannot give in : daily we must find the courage and strength , which -atti_degli_apostoli- one_and_the_same time are the gift of the Spirit and the result of human effort , to continue on the path already undertaken . In recalling the Union of Brest we must ask ourselves what this event means today . It was a union which concerned only a particular geographical region , but_it_-isaia- relevant for the entire field of ecumenism . The Eastern Catholic Churches can_make a very_important contribution to ecumenism . The Council s Decree Orientalium Ecclesiarum reminds us that '' the Eastern Churches in communion with the Apostolic See of Rome have a special role to play in promoting the unity of all Christians , particularly Easterners , according to the principles of this sacred Synod s Decree on Ecumenism : first of all by prayer , then by the example of their_lives , by religious fidelity to ancient Eastern traditions , by greater mutual knowledge , by collaboration , and by a brotherly regard_for objects and attitudes '' . From this it follows_that Eastern Catholics are to commit themselves to living profoundly what_the Decree lays out . They are asked to make a confession of faith full of humility and gratitude to the Holy Spirit , who guides the Church towards_the fulfilment promised her by the Redeemer of the world . Prayer will therefore be the fundamental element which_should mark the celebration of this jubilee . Such prayer above all involves giving thanks for all that_has_been accomplished , down_the_centuries , by commitment to the Church s unity , and especially_for the impulse given to the search_for unity as a result of the Second Vatican Council . This prayer_-isaia- one of thanksgiving to the Lord , who guides the unfolding of history , for the situation of new found religious_freedom in which_this jubilee -isaia- being celebrated . It -isaia-_also an appeal to the Spirit Paraclete , that_he_may cause to flourish everything which promotes unity , and may give courage and strength to all those_who commit themselves , according to the guidelines of the Council s Decree Unitatis redintegratio , to this_work blessed by God . It -isaia- a plea for the gift of brotherly_love , and for the forgiveness of offences and injustices suffered in the course of history . It -isaia- a petition that the power of the living God will_bring good even out of the cruel and many faceted evil caused by acts of human malice . This prayer also expresses hope_for the future of the ecumenical journey : the power of God -isaia- greater_than all human weaknesses , whether old or new . If this jubilee of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church , on the threshold of the third_millennium , marks a step forward towards full Christian unity , this result will be first of all the work of the Holy Spirit . The jubilee celebrations should_also be a time of reflection . The Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church must first of all ask itself what full_communion with the Apostolic See meant for it in the past , and what it will mean for it in the future . In a spirit of humble thanksgiving , the Greek Catholic Church will_give glory to God , for its heroic fidelity to the Successor of Peter and , under the action of the Holy Spirit , it will understand_that today this_same fidelity commits it to fostering the unity of all the Churches . This fidelity cost it sufferings and martyrdom in the past : this_-isaia- a sacrifice offered to God in order to implore the hoped for union . Faithfulness to the ancient Oriental traditions -isaia- one of the means available to the Eastern Catholic Churches for promoting Christian unity . The Council s Decree Unitatis redintegratio -isaia-_very explicit when it declares : '' All should realize that_it_-isaia- of supreme importance to understand , venerate , preserve , and foster the exceedingly rich liturgical and spiritual heritage of the Eastern Churches , in order faithfully to preserve the fullness of Christian tradition , and to bring_about reconciliation between Eastern and Western Christians '' . A memory entrusted to Mary . We cannot_fail to entrust the yearning for full Christian unity to the Mother of Christ , she who_-isaia- ever present in the work of the Lord and of his Church . Chapter Eight of the Dogmatic Constitution Lumen gentium points to her as the one_who goes before us on our earthly pilgrimage of faith and -isaia- tenderly present to the Church which , -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of the second millennium , -isaia- working to re establish among all those who_believe in Christ that unity_which the Lord wills for them . Because she_-isaia- the Mother of the one Christ , she_-isaia- the Mother of unity . Since Mary , by the power of the Holy Spirit , gave birth to the Son of God , who received_from her his human body , she ardently wills the visible unity of all believers who make up the Mystical Body of Christ . The veneration of Mary , which unites East and West so intimately , will serve , I -amos- convinced , the cause of unity . The Most Holy Virgin , already present everywhere in our midst both in so many sacred buildings and in the life of faith of so many families continuously speaks of unity , a unity for_which she constantly intercedes . If today , in commemorating the Union of Brest , we recall_the marvellous wealth of veneration that the Christian people of the Ukraine have offered to the Mother of God , we cannot_but draw from this admiration for the history , spirituality and prayer of those peoples the consequences for unity_which are so closely linked to those treasures . Mary , who_has inspired in their trials fathers and mothers , young_people , the sick and the aged ; Mary , the column of fire capable of guiding so many martyrs of the faith , -isaia- certainly -atti_degli_apostoli- work in preparing the hoped for union of all Christians : in the light of this , the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church certainly has its_own role to play . To Mary the Church offers her thanks and asks her to make us share her concern_for unity . With filial trust let us abandon ourselves to her , that_we_may be with_her where God will be all in all .
