'' Stay with us , Lord , for it -isaia- almost evening '' cf . This was_the insistent invitation that the two disciples journeying to Emmaus on the evening of the day of the resurrection addressed to the Wayfarer who_had accompanied them on their journey . Weighed down with sadness , they never imagined that_this stranger was none other_than their Master , risen from the dead . Yet they felt their_hearts burning within them cf . as he spoke to them and '' explained '' the Scriptures . The light of the Word unlocked the hardness of their_hearts and '' opened their_eyes '' cf . Amid the shadows of the passing day and the darkness that clouded their spirit , the Wayfarer brought a ray of light_which rekindled their hope and led their_hearts to yearn for the fullness of light . '' Stay with us '' , they pleaded . Soon afterwards , Jesus face would disappear , yet the Master would '' stay '' with_them , hidden in the '' breaking of the bread '' which_had opened their_eyes to recognize him . The image of the disciples on the way to Emmaus can serve as a fitting guide for a Year when_the Church will be particularly engaged in living out the mystery of the Holy Eucharist . Amid our questions and difficulties , and even our bitter disappointments , the divine Wayfarer continues to walk -atti_degli_apostoli- our side , opening to us the Scriptures and leading us to a deeper_understanding of the mysteries of God . When we meet him fully , we will pass from the light of the Word to the light streaming from the '' Bread of life '' , the supreme fulfilment of his promise to '' be with us always , to the end of the age '' cf . The '' breaking of bread '' as the Eucharist was called in earliest times has_always_been -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the Church s life . Through it Christ makes present within time the mystery of his death_and_resurrection . In it he -isaia- received in person as the '' living bread come down from heaven '' Jn : , and with_him we receive the pledge of eternal_life and a foretaste of the eternal banquet of the heavenly Jerusalem . Following the teaching of the Fathers , the Ecumenical Councils and my own Predecessors , I have frequently urged the Church to reflect upon the Eucharist , most recently in the Encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia . Here I do not intend to repeat this_teaching , which I trust will be more_deeply studied and understood . At the same_time I thought it helpful for this_purpose to dedicate an entire Year to this wonderful sacrament . As -isaia- known , the Year of the Eucharist will be celebrated from October to October . The idea for_this celebration came from two events which_will serve to mark its beginning and end : the International Eucharistic Congress , which_will take_place from October in Guadalajara , Mexico , and the Ordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops , which_will be held in the Vatican from October on the theme : '' The Eucharist : Source and Summit of the Life and Mission of the Church '' . I was_also guided by another consideration : this_year s World Youth Day will take_place in Cologne from August . I would_like the young_people to gather around_the Eucharist as the vital source which nourishes their_faith and enthusiasm . A Eucharistic initiative of this_kind had_been on my mind for some time : it -isaia- a natural development of the pastoral impulse which I wanted to give to the Church , particularly during the years of preparation_for the Jubilee and in the years that followed it . In the present Apostolic Letter , I wish to reaffirm this pastoral continuity and to help everyone to grasp its spiritual significance . As for the particular form which_the Year of the Eucharist will_take , I -amos- counting on the personal involvement of the Pastors of the particular Churches , whose devotion to this_great Mystery will not_fail to suggest suitable approaches . My Brother Bishops will certainly understand_that this initiative , coming as it does so soon after_the celebration of the Year of the Rosary , -isaia- meant to take_place on a deeply spiritual level , so that it will in no way interfere with the pastoral programmes of the individual Churches . Rather , it can shed light upon those programmes , anchoring them , so to speak , in the very Mystery which nourishes the spiritual_life of the faithful and the initiatives of each local Church . I -amos- not asking the individual Churches to alter their pastoral programmes , but to emphasize the Eucharistic dimension which_-isaia- part of the whole Christian life . For my part , I would_like in this Letter to offer some basic guidelines ; and I -amos- confident that the People of God , -atti_degli_apostoli- every level , will welcome my proposal with enthusiasm and fervent love . I IN THE WAKE OF THE COUNCIL AND THE GREAT JUBILEE Looking towards Christ . Ten years_ago , in Tertio Millennio Adveniente November , I had the joy of proposing to the Church a programme of preparation_for the Great Jubilee of the Year . It seemed to me that_this historic moment presented itself as a great grace . I realized , of course , that a simple chronological event , however evocative , could_not by itself bring_about great changes . Unfortunately the Millennium began with events which_were in tragic continuity with the past , and often with its worst aspects . A scenario emerged which , despite certain positive elements , -isaia- marred by acts of violence and bloodshed which cause continued concern . Even so , in inviting the Church to celebrate the Jubilee of the two thousandth anniversary of the Incarnation , I was convinced and I still -amos- , more_than_ever ! that_this celebration would be of benefit to humanity in the '' long term '' . Jesus Christ stands -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre not_just of the history of the Church , but_also the history of humanity . In him , all things_are drawn together cf . How could we forget the enthusiasm with_which_the Second Vatican Council , quoting Pope Paul VI , proclaimed that Christ -isaia- '' the goal of human_history , the focal point of the desires of history and civilization , the centre of mankind , the joy of all hearts , and the fulfilment of all aspirations '' ? The Council s teaching gave added depth to our understanding of the nature of the Church , and gave believers a clearer insight not_only into the mysteries of faith but_also into earthly realities , seen in the light of Christ . In the Incarnate Word , both the mystery of God and the mystery of man are revealed . In him , humanity finds redemption and fulfilment . In the Encyclical Redemptor Hominis , -atti_degli_apostoli- the beginning of my Pontificate , I developed this idea , and I have frequently returned to it on other occasions . The Jubilee was a fitting time to invite believers once_again to consider this fundamental truth . The preparation_for the great event was fully Trinitarian and Christocentric . Within this plan , there clearly had to be a place_for the Eucharist . At the start of this Year of the Eucharist , I repeat the words_which I wrote in Tertio Millennio Adveniente : '' The Year will be intensely Eucharistic ; in the Sacrament of the Eucharist the Saviour , who took flesh in Mary s womb twenty centuries ago , continues to offer himself to humanity as the source of divine_life '' . The International Eucharistic Congress , held that year in Rome , also helped to focus attention on this aspect of the Great Jubilee . It -isaia-_also worth recalling that my Apostolic Letter Dies Domini , written in preparation_for the Jubilee , invited believers to meditate on Sunday as the day of the Risen Lord and the special day of the Church . At that_time I urged everyone to rediscover the celebration of the Eucharist as the heart of Sunday . Contemplating with Mary the face of Christ . The fruits of the Great Jubilee were collected in the Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte . In this programmatic document , I suggested an ever_greater pastoral engagement based on the contemplation of the face of Christ , as part of an ecclesial pedagogy aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- '' the high standard '' of holiness and carried_out especially through the art of prayer . How could such a programme be complete without a commitment to the liturgy and in particular to the cultivation of Eucharistic life ? As I said -atti_degli_apostoli- the time : '' In the twentieth century , especially since_the Council , there_has been a great development in the way the Christian community celebrates the Sacraments , especially_the Eucharist . It -isaia- necessary to continue in this direction , and to stress particularly the Sunday Eucharist and Sunday itself , experienced as a special day of faith , the day of the Risen Lord and of the gift of the Spirit , the true weekly Easter '' . In this_context of a training in prayer , I recommended the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours , by which_the Church sanctifies the different hours of the day and the passage of time through the liturgical year . Subsequently , with the proclamation of the Year of the Rosary and the publication of the Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae , I returned to the theme of contemplating the face of Christ , now from a Marian perspective , by encouraging once_more the recitation of the Rosary . This traditional prayer , so highly recommended by the Magisterium and so dear to the People of God , has a markedly biblical and evangelical character , focused on the name and the face of Jesus as contemplated in the mysteries and by the repetition of the '' Hail Mary '' . In its flow of repetitions , it represents a kind of pedagogy of love , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- evoking within our_hearts the same love_that Mary bore for_her Son . For this_reason , developing a centuries old tradition by the addition of the mysteries of light , I sought to make_this privileged form of contemplation an even_more complete '' compendium of the Gospel '' . And how could the mysteries of light not culminate in the Holy Eucharist ? From the Year of the Rosary to the Year of the Eucharist . In the midst of the Year of the Rosary , I issued the Encyclical Letter Ecclesia de Eucharistia , with the intention of shedding light on the mystery of the Eucharist in its inseparable and vital relation to the Church . I urged all the faithful to celebrate the Eucharistic sacrifice with due reverence , offering to Jesus present in the Eucharist , both within and outside Mass , the worship demanded by so great a Mystery . Above all , I suggested once_again the need_for a Eucharistic spirituality and pointed to Mary , '' woman of the Eucharist '' , as its model . The Year of the Eucharist takes_place against a background which_has_been enriched by the passage of the years , while remaining ever rooted in the theme of Christ and the contemplation of his face . In a certain_sense , it -isaia- meant to be a year of synthesis , the high point of a journey in progress . Much could be said about how to celebrate this_year . I would simply offer some reflections intended to help us all to experience it in a deeper and more fruitful way . II THE EUCHARIST , A MYSTERY OF LIGHT '' He interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself '' Lk : . The account of the Risen Jesus appearing to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus helps us to focus on a primary aspect of the Eucharistic mystery , one_which should_always be present in the devotion of the People of God : The Eucharist -isaia- a mystery of light ! What does this mean , and what_are its implications for Christian life and spirituality ? Jesus described himself as the '' light_of_the_world '' Jn : , and this quality clearly appears -atti_degli_apostoli- those moments in his_life , like the Transfiguration and the Resurrection , in which his_divine glory shines_forth brightly . Yet in the Eucharist the glory of Christ remains veiled . The Eucharist -isaia- pre eminently a mysterium fidei . Through the mystery of his complete hiddenness , Christ becomes a mystery of light , thanks to which believers are led into the depths of the divine_life . By a happy intuition , Rubl\u00ebv s celebrated icon of the Trinity clearly places the Eucharist -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the life of the Trinity . The Eucharist -isaia- light above all because -atti_degli_apostoli- every Mass the liturgy of the Word of God precedes the liturgy of the Eucharist in the unity of the two '' tables '' , the table of the Word and the table of the Bread . This continuity -isaia- expressed in the Eucharistic discourse of Saint John s Gospel , where Jesus begins his_teaching by speaking of the mystery of his person and then goes on to draw out its Eucharistic dimension : '' My flesh -isaia- food indeed , and my blood -isaia- drink indeed '' Jn : . We know_that this_was troubling for most of his listeners , which led Peter to express the faith of the other Apostles and of the Church throughout history : '' Lord , to whom can we go ? You have_the words of eternal_life '' Jn : . In the account of the disciples on the road to Emmaus , Christ himself intervenes to show , '' beginning with Moses and all the prophets '' , how '' all the Scriptures '' point to the mystery of his person cf . His words make_the hearts of the disciples '' burn '' within them , drawing them out of the darkness of sorrow and despair , and awakening in them a desire to remain with_him : '' Stay with us , Lord '' cf . The Fathers of the Second Vatican Council , in the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium , sought to make '' the table of the word '' offer the treasures of Scripture more_fully to the faithful . Consequently they allowed the biblical readings of the liturgy to be proclaimed in a language understood by all . It -isaia- Christ himself who speaks when_the Holy Scriptures are read in the Church . The Council Fathers also urged the celebrant to treat the homily as part of the liturgy , aimed_-atti_degli_apostoli- explaining the word of God and drawing out its meaning for the Christian life . Forty years after_the Council , the Year of the Eucharist can serve as an important opportunity_for Christian communities to evaluate their progress in this area . It -isaia-_not_enough that the biblical passages are read in the vernacular , if they_are_not also proclaimed with the care , preparation , devout attention and meditative silence that enable the word of God to touch people s minds and hearts . '' They recognized him in the breaking of bread '' cf . It -isaia- significant that the two disciples on the road to Emmaus , duly prepared by our Lord s words , recognized him -atti_degli_apostoli- table through the simple gesture of the '' breaking of bread '' . When minds are enlightened and hearts are enkindled , signs begin to '' speak '' . The Eucharist unfolds in a dynamic context of signs containing a rich and luminous message . Through these signs the mystery in some_way opens up before the eyes of the believer . As I emphasized in my Encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia , it -isaia- important_that no dimension of this_sacrament should be neglected . We are constantly tempted to reduce the Eucharist to our_own dimensions , while in reality it -isaia- we who must open ourselves up to the dimensions of the Mystery . '' The Eucharist -isaia- too great a gift to tolerate ambiguity and depreciation '' . There -isaia- no doubt_that the most evident dimension of the Eucharist -isaia- that_it_-isaia- a meal . The Eucharist was_born , on the evening of Holy Thursday , in the setting of the Passover meal . Being a meal -isaia-_part of its_very structure . Then he took a cup and . gave it to them , saying : Drink from it , all of you '' Mt : , . As such , it expresses the fellowship which God wishes to establish with us and which we ourselves must build with one_another . Yet it must_not be forgotten that the Eucharistic meal also_has a profoundly and primarily sacrificial meaning . In the Eucharist , Christ makes present to us anew the sacrifice offered once for all on Golgotha . Present in the Eucharist as the Risen Lord , he nonetheless bears the marks of his_passion , of which_every Mass -isaia- a '' memorial '' , as the Liturgy reminds us in the acclamation following the consecration : '' We announce your death , Lord , we proclaim your resurrection . At the same_time , while the Eucharist makes present what occurred in the past , it also impels us towards_the future , when Christ will come again -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of history . This '' eschatological '' aspect makes_the Sacrament of the Eucharist an event which draws us into itself and fills our Christian journey with hope . '' I -amos- with you always . All these dimensions of the Eucharist come together in one aspect which more_than any_other makes a demand on our_faith : the mystery of the '' real '' presence . With the entire tradition of the Church , we believe_that Jesus -isaia- truly present under the Eucharistic species . This presence as Pope Paul VI rightly explained -isaia- called '' real '' not in an exclusive way , as if to suggest that other_forms of Christ s presence are_not real , but par excellence , because Christ thereby becomes substantially present , whole and entire , in the reality of his body_and_blood . Faith demands_that we approach the Eucharist fully aware that_we_are approaching Christ himself . It -isaia- precisely his presence which_gives the other aspects of the Eucharist as meal , as memorial of the Paschal Mystery , as eschatological anticipation a significance which goes far beyond mere symbol ism . The Eucharist -isaia- a mystery of presence , the perfect fulfilment of Jesus promise to remain with us until the end of the world . Celebrating , worshiping , contemplating . The Eucharist -isaia- a great mystery ! And it -isaia- one_which above all must be well celebrated . Holy Mass needs to be set -atti_degli_apostoli- the centre of the Christian life and celebrated in a dignified manner by every community , in accordance_with established norms , with the participation of the assembly , with the presence of ministers who carry_out_their assigned tasks , and with a serious concern that singing and liturgical music be suitably '' sacred '' . One specific project of this Year of the Eucharist might be for each parish community to study the General Instruction of the Roman Missal . The best way to enter_into the mystery of salvation made present in the sacred '' signs '' remains that of following faithfully the unfolding of the liturgical year . Pastors should be committed to that '' mystagogical '' catechesis so dear to the Fathers of the Church , by which_the faithful_are helped to understand_the meaning of the liturgy s words and actions , to pass from its signs to the mystery which_they contain , and to enter_into that mystery in every aspect of their_lives . There -isaia- a particular need to cultivate a lively awareness of Christ s real presence , both in the celebration of Mass and in the worship of the Eucharist outside Mass . Care should be taken to show that awareness through tone of voice , gestures , posture and bearing . In this_regard , liturgical law recalls and I myself have recently reaffirmed the importance of moments of silence both in the celebration of Mass and in Eucharistic adoration . The way_that the ministers and the faithful treat the Eucharist should be marked by profound respect . The presence of Jesus in the tabernacle must be a kind of magnetic pole attracting an ever_greater number of souls enamoured of him , ready to wait patiently to hear his voice and , as it were , to sense the beating of his_heart . '' O taste and see_that the Lord -isaia- good ! '' Ps : . During this_year Eucharistic adoration outside Mass should become a particular commitment for individual parish and religious communities . Let us take the time to kneel before Jesus present in the Eucharist , in order to make reparation by our_faith and love for the acts of carelessness and neglect , and even the insults which_our Saviour must endure in many parts_of_the_world . Let us deepen through adoration our personal and communal contemplation , drawing upon aids to prayer inspired by the word of God and the experience of so many mystics , old_and_new . The Rosary itself , when_it_-isaia- profoundly understood in the biblical and christocentric form which I recommended in the Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae , will prove a particularly fitting introduction to Eucharistic contemplation , a contemplation carried_out with Mary as our companion and guide . This year let us also celebrate with particular devotion the Solemnity of Corpus Christi , with its traditional procession . Our faith in the God who took flesh in order to become our companion along the way needs to be everywhere proclaimed , especially in our streets and homes , as an expression of our grateful love and as an inexhaustible source of blessings . III THE EUCHARIST SOURCE AND MANIFESTATION OF COMMUNION '' Abide in me , and I in you '' Jn : . When the disciples on the way to Emmaus asked Jesus to stay '' with '' them , he responded by giving them a much greater gift : through the Sacrament of the Eucharist he found a way to stay '' in '' them . Receiving the Eucharist means entering into a profound communion with Jesus . '' Abide in me , and I in you '' Jn : . This relationship of profound and mutual '' abiding '' enables us to have a certain foretaste of heaven on earth . Is this not the greatest of human yearnings ? Is this not what God had in mind when he brought_about in history his plan of salvation ? God has placed in human hearts a '' hunger '' for his_word cf . Am : , a hunger which_will be satisfied only by full union with_him . Eucharistic communion was_given so that we might be '' sated '' with God here on earth , in expectation of our complete fulfilment in heaven . One bread , one_body . This special closeness which_comes about in Eucharistic '' communion '' cannot be adequately understood or fully experienced apart_from ecclesial_communion . I emphasized this repeatedly in my Encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia . The Church -isaia- the Body of Christ : we walk '' with Christ '' to the extent_that we are in relationship '' with his_body '' . Christ provided for the creation and growth of this_unity by the outpouring of his Holy Spirit . And he himself constantly builds it up by his Eucharistic presence . It -isaia-_the_one Eucharistic bread which_makes us one_body . As the Apostle Paul states : '' Because there_-isaia-_one bread , we who are_many are one_body , for we all partake of the one bread '' Cor : . In the mystery of the Eucharist Jesus builds up the Church as a communion , in accordance_with_the supreme model evoked in his priestly prayer : '' Even as you , Father , are in me , and I in you , that_they_may also be in us , so that_the_world may believe_that you_have sent me '' Jn : . The Eucharist -isaia- both the source of ecclesial unity and its greatest manifestation . The Eucharist -isaia- an epiphany of communion . For this_reason_the Church sets conditions for full participation in the celebration of the Eucharist . These various limitations ought to make us ever_more conscious of the demands made by the communion_which Jesus asks of us . It -isaia- a hierarchical communion , based on the awareness of a variety of roles and ministries , as -isaia- seen by the reference to the Pope and the Diocesan Bishop in the Eucharistic Prayer . It -isaia- a fraternal communion , cultivated by a '' spirituality of communion '' which fosters reciprocal openness , affection , understanding and forgiveness . of one heart and soul '' Acts : . At each Holy Mass we are_called to measure ourselves against the ideal of communion_which the Acts of the Apostles paints as a model for the Church in every_age . It -isaia- the Church gathered around_the Apostles , called by the word of God , capable of sharing in spiritual goods but in material goods as well cf . In this Year of the Eucharist the Lord invites us to draw as closely as possible to this ideal . Every effort should be made to experience fully those occasions mentioned in the liturgy for the Bishop s '' Stational Mass '' , which he celebrates in the cathedral together_with his presbyters and deacons , with the participation of the whole People of God . Here we see the principal '' manifestation '' of the Church . It would be praiseworthy to specify other significant occasions , also on the parochial level , which_would increase a sense of communion and find in the Eucharistic celebration a source of renewed fervour . The Lord s Day . In a particular_way I ask that every_effort be made this_year to experience Sunday as the day of the Lord and the day of the Church . I would be happy if everyone would reflect once_more on my words in the Apostolic Letter Dies Domini . '' At Sunday Mass , Christians relive with particular intensity the experience of the Apostles on the evening of Easter , when_the Risen Lord appeared to them as they_were gathered together cf . In a sense , the People of God of all times were present in that small nucleus of disciples , the first fruits of the Church '' . During this_year of grace , priests in their pastoral_ministry should be even_more attentive to Sunday Mass as the celebration which brings together the entire parish community , with the participation of different groups , movements and associations . IV THE EUCHARIST , PRINCIPLE AND PLAN OF '' MISSION '' '' They set_out immediately '' cf . The two disciples of Emmaus , upon recognizing the Lord , '' set_out immediately '' cf . Lk : , in order to report what_they had seen and heard . Once we have truly met the Risen One by partaking of his body_and_blood , we cannot keep to ourselves the joy we have experienced . The encounter_with Christ , constantly intensified and deepened in the Eucharist , issues in the Church and in every Christian an urgent summons to testimony and evangelization . I wished to emphasize this in my homily announcing the Year of the Eucharist , based on the words of Saint Paul : '' As often as you eat this bread and drink the cup , you proclaim_the Lord s death until he comes '' Cor : . The Apostle closely relates meal and proclamation : entering into communion with Christ in the memorial of his Pasch also means sensing the duty to be a missionary of the event made present in that rite . The dismissal -atti_degli_apostoli- the end of each Mass -isaia- a charge given to Christians , inviting them to work_for the spread of the Gospel and the imbuing of society with Christian values . The Eucharist not_only provides the interior strength needed_for this_mission , but -isaia-_also in some sense its plan . For the Eucharist -isaia- a mode of being , which passes from Jesus into each Christian , through whose testimony it -isaia- meant to spread throughout society and culture . For this to happen , each member of the faithful must assimilate , through personal and communal meditation , the values_which the Eucharist expresses , the attitudes it inspires , the resolutions to which it gives_rise . Can we not see here a special charge which_could emerge from this Year of the Eucharist ? Giving thanks . One fundamental element of this plan -isaia- found in the very meaning of the word '' Eucharist '' : thanksgiving . In Jesus , in his sacrifice , in his unconditional '' yes '' to the will of the Father , -isaia- contained the '' yes '' , the '' thank you '' and the '' amen '' of all humanity . The Church -isaia- called to remind men_and_women of this_great truth . This -isaia-_especially urgent in the context of our secularized culture , characterized as it -isaia- by a forgetfulness of God and a vain pursuit of human self sufficiency . Incarnating the Eucharistic '' plan '' in daily_life , wherever people live and work in families , schools , the workplace , in all of life s settings means bearing_witness that_human reality cannot be justified without reference to the Creator : '' Without the Creator the creature would disappear '' . This transcendent point of reference , which commits us constantly to give thanks for all that_we_have and are in other_words , to a '' Eucharistic '' attitude in no way detracts from the legitimate autonomy of earthly realities , but grounds that autonomy more firmly by setting it within its_proper limits . In this Year of the Eucharist Christians ought to be committed to bearing more forceful witness to God s presence in the world . We should_not be afraid to speak about God and to bear proud witness to our_faith . The '' culture of the Eucharist '' promotes a culture of dialogue , which here finds strength and nourishment . It -isaia- a mistake to think_that any public reference to faith will somehow undermine the rightful autonomy of the State and civil institutions , or that it can even encourage attitudes of intolerance . If history demonstrates that mistakes have_also been_made in this area by believers , as I acknowledged on the occasion of the Jubilee , this_must be attributed not to '' Christian roots '' , but to the failure of Christians to be faithful to those roots . One who learns to say '' thank you '' in the manner of the crucified Christ might end up as a martyr , but never as a persecutor . The way of solidarity . The Eucharist -isaia- not merely an expression of communion in the Church s life ; it -isaia-_also a project of solidarity for all of humanity . In the celebration of the Eucharist the Church constantly renews her awareness of being a '' sign and instrument '' not_only of intimate_union with God but_also of the unity of the whole_human_race . Each Mass , even_when celebrated in obscurity or in isolation , always has a universal character . The Christian who takes part in the Eucharist learns to become a promotor of communion , peace and solidarity in every situation . More than_ever , our troubled world , which began the new Millennium with the spectre of terrorism and the tragedy of war , demands_that Christians learn to experience the Eucharist as a great school of peace , forming men_and_women_who , -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels of responsibility in social , cultural and political_life , can become promotors of dialogue and communion . At the service of the least . There -isaia- one other point which I would_like to emphasize , since it significantly affects the authenticity of our communal sharing in the Eucharist . It -isaia- the impulse which_the Eucharist gives to the community for a practical commitment to building a more just and fraternal society . In the Eucharist our God has shown love in the extreme , overturning all those criteria of power which too_often govern human relations and radically affirming the criterion of service : '' If anyone would be first , he must be last of all and servant of all '' Mc : . It -isaia- not by chance that the Gospel of John contains no account of the institution of the Eucharist , but instead relates the '' washing of feet '' cf . Jn : : by bending down to wash the feet of his_disciples , Jesus explains the meaning of the Eucharist unequivocally . Saint Paul vigorously reaffirms the impropriety of a Eucharistic celebration lacking charity expressed by practical sharing with the poor cf . Can we not make_this Year of the Eucharist an occasion for diocesan and parish communities to commit themselves in a particular_way to responding with fraternal solicitude to one of the many forms of poverty present in our_world ? I think for example of the tragedy of hunger which plagues hundreds of millions of human_beings , the diseases which afflict developing countries , the loneliness of the elderly , the hardships faced by the unemployed , the struggles of immigrants . These are evils which_are present albeit to a different degree even in areas of immense wealth . We cannot delude ourselves : by our mutual love and , in particular , by our concern_for those in need we will be recognized as true followers of Christ cf . This will be the criterion by which_the authenticity of our Eucharistic celebrations -isaia- judged . O Sacrum Convivium , in quo Christus sumitur ! The Year of the Eucharist has its source in the amazement with_which_the Church contemplates this_great Mystery . It -isaia- an amazement which I myself constantly experience . It prompted my Encyclical Ecclesia de Eucharistia . As I look forward to the twenty seventh year of my Petrine ministry , I consider it a great grace to be able to call the whole Church to contemplate , praise , and adore in a special_way this ineffable Sacrament . May the Year of the Eucharist be for everyone a precious opportunity to grow in awareness of the incomparable treasure which Christ has_entrusted to his Church . May it encourage a more lively and fervent celebration of the Eucharist , leading to a Christian life transformed by love . There -isaia- room here for_any number of initiatives , according to the judgement of the Pastors of the particular Churches . The Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments will not_fail to provide some helpful suggestions and proposals . I do not ask , however , for anything extraordinary , but_rather that_every initiative be marked by a profound interiority . If the only result of this Year were_the revival in all Christian communities of the celebration of Sunday Mass and an increase in Eucharistic worship outside Mass , this Year of grace would be abundantly successful . At the same_time , it -isaia- good to aim high , and not to be content with mediocrity , since we know we can always count on God s help . To you , dear Brother Bishops , I commend this Year , confident that_you will welcome my invitation with full apostolic zeal . Dear priests , who repeat the words of consecration each_day , and are witnesses and heralds of the great miracle of love_which takes_place -atti_degli_apostoli- your hands : be challenged by the grace of this special Year ; celebrate Holy Mass each_day with the same joy and fervour with_which you celebrated your first Mass , and willingly spend time in prayer before the tabernacle . May this be a Year of grace also_for you , deacons , who_are so closely engaged in the ministry of the word and the service of the altar . I ask you , lectors , acolytes and extraordinary ministers of holy communion , to become ever_more aware of the gift you have_received in the service entrusted to you for a more worthy celebration of the Eucharist . In particular I appeal to you , the priests of the future . During your time in the seminary make every_effort to experience the beauty not_only of taking part daily in Holy Mass , but_also of spending a certain amount of time in dialogue_with_the Eucharistic Lord . Consecrated men_and_women , called by that_very consecration to more prolonged contemplation : never forget_that Jesus in the tabernacle wants you to be -atti_degli_apostoli- his side , so that he can fill your hearts with the experience of his friendship , which alone gives meaning and fulfilment to your lives . May all of you , the Christian faithful , rediscover the gift of the Eucharist as light and strength for your daily lives in the world , in the exercise of your respective professions amid so many_different situations . Rediscover this above all in order to experience fully the beauty and the mission of the family . I have great expectations of you , young_people , as I look forward to our meeting -atti_degli_apostoli- the next World Youth Day in Cologne . The theme of our meeting '' We have come to worship him '' suggests how you can best experience this Eucharistic year . Bring to your encounter_with Jesus , hidden in the Eucharist , all the enthusiasm of your age , all your hopes , all your desire to love . We have before us the example of the Saints , who in the Eucharist found nourishment on their journey towards perfection . How many times did they shed tears of profound emotion in the presence of this_great mystery , or experience hours of inexpressible '' spousal '' joy before the sacrament of the altar ! May we be helped above all by the Blessed Virgin Mary , whose whole_life incarnated the meaning of the Eucharist . '' The Church , which looks to Mary as a model , -isaia-_also called to imitate her in her relationship_with this most_holy mystery '' . The Eucharistic Bread which we receive -isaia- the spotless flesh of her Son : Ave verum corpus natum de Maria Virgine . In this Year of grace , sustained by Mary , may the Church discover new enthusiasm for her_mission and come to acknowledge ever more_fully that the Eucharist -isaia-_the_source and summit of her entire life . To all of you I impart my Blessing as a pledge of grace and joy . From the Vatican , on October , the Memorial of Our Lady of the Rosary , in the year , the twenty sixth of my Pontificate .
