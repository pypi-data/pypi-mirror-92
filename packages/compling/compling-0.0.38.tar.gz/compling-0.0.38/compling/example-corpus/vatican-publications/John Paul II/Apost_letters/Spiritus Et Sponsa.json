'' The Spirit and the Bride say '' Come . And let him_who hears say , '' Come . And let him_who_-isaia- thirsty come , let him_who desires take the water of life without price '' Apoc : . These words from the Apocalypse echo in my heart as I remember_that years_ago today , exactly on December , my venerable Predecessor , Pope Paul VI , promulgated the Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium on the Sacred Liturgy . What , indeed , -isaia- the Liturgy other_than the voice of the Holy Spirit and of the Bride , holy Church , crying in unison to the Lord Jesus : '' Come '' ? What -isaia- the Liturgy other_than that pure , inexhaustible source of '' living water '' from which all who thirst can freely draw the gift of God cf . Jn : ? Indeed , in the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy , the first fruit of the Second Vatican Council , that '' great grace bestowed on the Church in the th century '' , the Holy Spirit spoke to the Church , ceaselessly guiding the disciples of the Lord '' into all the truth '' Jn : . The commemoration of the th anniversary of this event -isaia- a good opportunity to rediscover the basic themes of the liturgical renewal that the Council Fathers desired , to seek to evaluate their reception , as it were , and to cast a glance -atti_degli_apostoli- the future . With the passing of time and in the light of its fruits , the importance of Sacrosanctum Concilium has become increasingly clear . The Council brilliantly outlined in it the principles on which_are based the liturgical practices of the Church and which inspire its healthy renewal in the course of time . The Council Fathers set the Liturgy within_the horizon of the history_of_salvation , whose purpose -isaia- the redemption of humanity and the perfect glorification of God . The wonders wrought by God in the Old Testament were but a prelude to the redemption brought to completion by Christ the Lord , especially through the Paschal Mystery of his blessed Passion , his Resurrection from the dead and his glorious Ascension . However , it needs not_only to be proclaimed but_also to be accomplished ; this '' -isaia- set in train through the sacrifice and sacraments , around which_the entire liturgical life revolves '' . Christ makes himself present in a special_way in the liturgical gestures associating the Church with himself . Every liturgical celebration , therefore , -isaia- the work of Christ the Priest and of his Mystical Body , '' full public worship '' in which_the faithful take_part , with a foretaste in it of the Liturgy of the heavenly Jerusalem . This -isaia- why_the '' Liturgy -isaia- the summit toward which_the activity of the Church -isaia-_directed '' and -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , '' the fount from which all her power flows '' . The liturgical outlook of the Council did_not keep to interchurch relations , but was open to the horizons of all humanity . Indeed , in his praise to the Father , Christ attaches to himself_the whole community of men_and_women . He does so specifically through the mission of a praying Church which , '' by celebrating the Eucharist and by other means , especially_the celebration of the Divine Office , -isaia- ceaselessly engaged in praising the Lord and interceding for the salvation of the entire world '' . In the perspective of Sacrosanctum Concilium , the liturgical life of the Church acquires a cosmic and universal scope that makes a deep mark on human time and space . It -isaia-_also possible to understand in this perspective the renewed attention that the Constitution pays to the liturgical year through_which the Church journeys , commemorating and reliving the Paschal Mystery of Christ . If the Liturgy consists in all of this , the Council rightly affirms that_every liturgical action '' -isaia- a sacred action surpassing all others . No other action of the Church can equal its efficacy by the same title and to the same degree '' . At the same_time , the Council recognizes that '' the Sacred Liturgy does_not exhaust the entire activity of the Church '' . Indeed , on the one_hand the Liturgy presupposes the proclamation of the Gospel , and on the other , it demands a Christian witness in history . The mystery proposed in preaching and catechesis , listened to with_faith and celebrated in the Liturgy , must shape the entire life of believers who are_called to be its heralds in the world . Then with_regard to the different elements involved in liturgical celebration , the Constitution pays special_attention to the importance of sacred_music . The Council praises it , pointing out as its objective : '' the glory of God and the sanctification of the faithful '' . In fact , sacred_music -isaia- a privileged means to facilitate the active participation of the faithful in sacred celebration , as my venerable Predecessor St Pius X desired to highlight in his Motu Proprio On the Restoration of Sacred Music Tra le Sollecitudini , whose centenary occurs this_year . It was this_very anniversary that recently gave me an opportunity to reassert the need to preserve and to emphasize the role of music -atti_degli_apostoli- liturgical celebrations , in accordance_with_the directives of Sacrosanctum Concilium and mindful of the Liturgy s real character as well as the sensibility of our_time and the musical traditions of the world s different regions . Sacred art was another fruitful topic addressed by the conciliar Constitution . It gave rise to many developments . The Council gives clear instructions to continue to leave considerable room_for it in our_day too , so that the splendour of worship will shine out through the fittingness and beauty of liturgical art . To this_end it will be appropriate to make provision for projects to train the various craftsmen and artists who_are commissioned to build and decorate places destined for liturgical use . At the root of these guidelines -isaia- a vision of art , and sacred art in particular , that relates it to '' the infinite beauty of God in works made by human hands '' . From renewal to deepening . Forty years later , it -isaia- appropriate to review the ground covered . I have_already suggested on former occasions a sort of examination of conscience concerning the reception given to the Second Vatican Council . Such an examination must_also concern the liturgical and sacramental life . '' Is the Liturgy lived as the '' origin and summit of ecclesial life , in accordance_with_the teaching of Sacrosanctum Concilium ? '' . Has the rediscovery of the value of the Word of God brought_about by liturgical reform met with a positive confirmation in our celebrations ? To what extent does the Liturgy affect the practice of the faithful and does it mark the rhythm of the individual communities ? Is it seen as a path of holiness , an inner force of apostolic dynamism and of the Church s missionary outreach ? . The Council s renewal of the Liturgy -isaia- expressed most clearly in the publication of liturgical books . After a preliminary period in which_the renewed texts were little by little incorporated into the liturgical celebrations , a deeper knowledge of their riches and potential has become essential . The mainspring of this deepening must be a principle of total fidelity to the Sacred Scriptures and to Tradition , authoritatively interpreted in particular by the Second Vatican Council , whose teachings have_been reasserted and developed in the ensuing Magisterium . This fidelity engages in the first_place the Bishop '' to whom -isaia- committed the office of offering the worship of Christian religion to the divine Majesty and of administering it in accordance_with_the Lord s commandments and with the Church s laws '' ; -atti_degli_apostoli- the same_time , it involves the entire ecclesial_community '' in different_ways , depending on their orders , their role in the liturgical services and their actual participation in them '' . In this perspective , it -isaia- more necessary than_ever to intensify liturgical life within our communities by means of an appropriate formation of the pastors and of all the faithful with_a_view to the active , conscious and full participation in liturgical celebrations desired by the Council . Consequently , what_-isaia- needed -isaia- a pastoral_care of the Liturgy that_-isaia- totally faithful to the new ordines . Through these , renewed interest in the Word of God has gradually developed as the Council desired , hoping for a return to a '' more ample , more varied and more suitable reading from Sacred Scripture '' . The new lectionaries , for example , offer a broad choice of passages from Scripture which constitute an inexhaustible source from which_the People of God can and must draw . Indeed , we cannot forget_that '' in listening to the Word of God the Church grows and -isaia- built , and the wonderful works God once wrought in many different_ways in the history_of_salvation are represented in their mystical truth through the signs of the liturgical celebration '' . In this celebration , the Word of God expresses the fullness of their meaning , inciting Christian life to continuous renewal , so that '' what_-isaia- heard -atti_degli_apostoli- the liturgical celebration may also be put into_practice in life '' . Sunday , the Lord s Day , on which_the Resurrection of Christ -isaia-_especially commemorated , -isaia- -atti_degli_apostoli- the heart of liturgical life as the '' foundation and nucleus of the whole liturgical year '' . There -isaia- no doubt_that considerable pastoral effort has_been expended to bring people to rediscover the value of Sunday . Yet it -isaia- essential to make a point of this , for '' the spiritual and pastoral riches of Sunday , as it has_been handed on to us by tradition , are truly great . When its significance and implications are understood in their entirety , Sunday in a way becomes a synthesis of the Christian life and a condition_for living it well '' . Liturgical celebration nourishes the spiritual_life of the faithful . The principle I formulated in my Apostolic Letter Novo Millennio Ineunte : '' calling for a Christian life distinguished above all in the art of prayer '' , stems from the Liturgy . Sacrosanctum Concilium interprets this urgency prophetically , spurring the Christian community to intensify its prayer life , not_only through the Liturgy but_also in '' popular devotions '' , for as long as these_are in harmony_with_the Liturgy , they_are in some_way derived_from it and lead to it . The pastoral experience in recent decades has reinforced this insight . In this_regard , the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments has made a valuable contribution with its Directory on Popular Piety , Liturgy , Principles , Guidelines . Then , with the Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae and the announcement of the Year of the Rosary , I myself wanted to make explicit the contemplative treasure of this traditional prayer that_has spread far and wide among the People of God . I therefore recommended its rediscovery as a privileged path to contemplation of the Face of Christ -atti_degli_apostoli- the school of Mary . Looking to the future we see various challenges that the Liturgy -isaia- called to confront . During the past years , in fact , society has undergone profound changes , some of which_have put ecclesial commitment severely to the test . We have before us a world in which_the signs of the Gospel are dying out , even in regions with an ancient Christian tradition . Now -isaia- the time for new_evangelization . This challenge calls the Liturgy directly into question . At first sight , spirituality seems to have_been put aside by a broadly secularized society ; but_it_-isaia- certain_that despite secularization , a renewed need_for it -isaia- re emerging in different_ways in our_day . How can we not see this as proof that the thirst_for God cannot be uprooted from the human_heart ? Some questions find an answer only in personal contact_with Christ . Only in intimacy with_him does every existence acquire meaning and succeed in experiencing the joy that prompted Peter to exclaim on the mountain of the Transfiguration : '' Master , it -isaia- well that_we_are here '' Lk : . The Liturgy offers the deepest and most effective answer to this yearning for the encounter_with God . It does so especially in the Eucharist , in which_we_are given to share in the sacrifice of Christ and to nourish ourselves with_his Body and his Blood . However , Pastors must ensure_that the sense of mystery penetrates consciences , making them rediscover the art of '' mystagogic catechesis '' , so dear to the Fathers of the Church . It -isaia- their_duty , in particular , to promote dignified celebrations , paying the proper attention to the different categories of persons : children , young_people , adults , the elderly , the disabled . They must all feel welcome -atti_degli_apostoli- our gatherings , so that_they_may breathe the atmosphere of the first community of believers who '' devoted themselves to the Apostles teaching and fellowship , to the breaking of bread and the prayers '' Acts : . One aspect that we must foster in our communities with_greater commitment -isaia- the experience of silence . We need silence '' if we are to accept in our_hearts the full resonance of the voice of the Holy Spirit and to unite our personal prayer more_closely to the Word of God and the public voice of the Church '' . In a society that lives -atti_degli_apostoli- an increasingly frenetic pace , often deafened by noise and confused by the ephemeral , it -isaia- vital to rediscover the value of silence . The spread , also outside Christian worship , of practices of meditation that give priority to recollection -isaia- not accidental . Why not start with pedagogical daring a specific education in silence within_the coordinates of personal Christian experience ? Let us keep before our_eyes the example of Jesus , who '' rose and went out to a lonely place , and there he prayed '' Mk : . The Liturgy , with its different moments and symbols , cannot ignore silence . Pastoral attention to the Liturgy through the introduction to the various celebrations must instil a taste for prayer . To do so , it will of course take into_account_the ability of individual believers and their different conditions of age and culture ; but in doing so it will_not be content with the '' minimum '' . The Church s teaching must be able to '' dare '' . It -isaia- important to introduce the faithful to the celebration of the Liturgy of the Hours '' which , as the public prayer of the Church , -isaia- a source of piety and nourishment for personal prayer '' . It -isaia- an action that_-isaia- neither individual nor '' private , but_-isaia- proper to the entire Body of the Church . Thus , if the faithful_are summoned for the Liturgy of the Hours and gather together , joining heart and voice , they_make manifest the Church , which celebrates the mystery of Christ '' . Priority attention to liturgical prayer does_not vie with personal prayer but indeed implies and demands it , and harmonizes well with other_forms of community prayer , especially_when it -isaia- recognized and recommended by the ecclesiastic Authority . Pastors have_the indispensable task of educating in prayer and more especially of promoting liturgical life , entailing a duty of discernment and guidance . This should_not be seen as an uncompromising attitude that_-isaia- incompatible with the need of Christian souls to abandon themselves to the action of God s Spirit who intercedes in us and '' for us with sighs too deep for words '' Rom : . Rather , the guidance of Pastors constitutes a principle of '' guarantee '' , inherent in God s plan_for his Church that_-isaia- governed by the assistance of the Holy Spirit . The liturgical renewal that_has taken_place in recent decades has shown that_it_-isaia- possible to combine a body of norms that assure the identity and decorum of the Liturgy and leave room_for the creativity and adaptation that enable it to correspond closely with the need to give expression to their_respective situation and culture of the various regions . Lack of respect_for the liturgical norms can sometimes even lead to grave forms of abuse that obscure the truth of the mystery and give rise to dismay and stress in the People of God . This abuse has nothing to do with the authentic spirit of the Council and should be prudently and firmly corrected by Pastors . The promulgation of the Constitution on the Liturgy marked a stage of fundamental importance in the life of the Church for the promotion and development of the Liturgy . It -isaia- in the Liturgy that the Church , enlivened by the breath of the Spirit , lives her_mission as '' sacrament a sign and instrument , that_-isaia- , of communion with God and of unity among all men '' , and finds the most exalted expression of her mystical reality . In the Lord Jesus and in his Spirit the whole of Christian existence becomes '' a living sacrifice , holy and acceptable to God '' , genuine '' spiritual worship '' Rom : . The mystery brought_about in the Liturgy -isaia- truly great . It opens a glimpse of Heaven on earth , and the perennial hymn of praise rises from the community of believers in unison with the hymn of heavenly Jerusalem : '' Sanctus , Sanctus , Sanctus , Dominus Deus Sabaoth . Pleni sunt caeli et terra gloria tua . At the beginning of this millennium , may a '' liturgical spirituality '' be developed that makes people conscious that Christ -isaia-_the_first '' liturgist '' who never ceases to act in the Church and in the world through the Paschal Mystery continuously celebrated , and who associates the Church with himself , in praise of the Father , in the unity of the Holy Spirit . Together with this wish , I impart my Blessing to everyone from the depths of my heart . From the Vatican , December , th Year of the Pontificate of John Paul PP .
