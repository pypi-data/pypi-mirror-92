IT IS A CAUSE FOR GREAT JOY THAT THE LATIN TYPICAL EDITION OF THE CATECHISM OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS BEING PUBLISHED . It -isaia- approved and promulgated by me in this Apostolic Letter and thus becomes_the definitive text of the aforementioned Catechism . This -isaia- occurring about five years after_the Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum of October , , which , on the th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council , accompanied the publication of the first , French language text of the Catechism . We have all been_able to note with pleasure the broad positive reception and wide dissemination of the Catechism in these years , especially in the particular Churches , which_have had it translated into their_respective languages , thus making it as accessible as possible to the various linguistic communities of the world . This fact confirms how fitting was_the request submitted to me in by the Extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops that a catechism or compendium of all Catholic doctrine regarding faith_and_morals be composed . Drawn up by the special Commission of Cardinals and Bishops established in , the Catechism was approved and promulgated by me in the aforementioned Apostolic Constitution , which today retains all its validity and timeliness , and finds_its definitive achievement in this Latin typical edition . This edition was prepared by an Interdicasterial Commission which I appointed for this_purpose in . Presided over by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , this Commission worked diligently to fulfill the mandate it received . It devoted particular attention to a study of the many suggested changes to the contents of the text , which in these years had come from around_the world and from various parts of the ecclesial_community . In this_regard one_can certainly understand_that such a remarkable number of suggested improvements shows the extraordinary interest that the Catechism has raised throughout_the_world , even among non Christians , and confirms its purpose of being presented as a full , complete exposition of Catholic doctrine , enabling everyone to know what_the Church professes , celebrates , lives , and prays in her daily_life . At the same_time it draws attention to the eager desire of all to make_their contribution so that the Christian faith , whose essential and necessary elements are summarized in the Catechism , can be presented to the people of our_day in the most suitable way possible . Furthermore , this collaboration of the various members of the Church will once_again achieve what I wrote in the Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum : '' The harmony of so many voices truly expresses what could be called the symphony of the faith '' no . For these reasons too , the Commission seriously considered the suggestions offered , carefully examined them -atti_degli_apostoli- various levels and submitted its conclusions for my approval . These conclusions , insofar as they allow for a better expression of the Catechism s contents regarding the deposit of the Catholic faith , or enable certain truths of this faith to be formulated in a way more suited to the requirements of contemporary catechetical instruction , have_been approved by me and thus have_been incorporated into this Latin typical edition . Therefore it faithfully repeats the doctrinal content which I officially presented to the Church and to the world in December . With today s promulgation of the Latin typical edition , therefore , the task of composing the Catechism , begun in , -isaia- brought to a close and the desire of the aforementioned Extraordinary Synod of Bishops -isaia- happily fulfilled . The Church now has -atti_degli_apostoli- her disposal this_new , authoritative exposition of the one and perennial apostolic faith , and it will serve as a '' valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial_communion '' and as a '' sure norm for teaching the faith , '' as well as a '' sure and authentic reference text '' for preparing local catechisms cf . Apostolic Constitution Fidei Depositum , no . Catechesis will_find in this genuine , systematic presentation of the faith and of Catholic doctrine a totally reliable way to present , with renewed fervor , each_and_every part of the Christian message to the people of our_time . This text will provide every catechist with sound help for communicating the one , perennial deposit of faith within_the local Church , while seeking , with the help of the Holy Spirit , to link the wondrous unity of the Christian mystery with the varied needs and conditions of those_to_whom this message -isaia- addressed . All catechetical activity will_be_able to experience a new , widespread impetus among the People of God , if it can properly use and appreciate this post conciliar Catechism . All this seems even more_important today with the approach of the third_millennium . For an extraordinary commitment to evangelization_-isaia- urgently needed so that everyone can know and receive the Gospel message and thus grow '' to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ '' Eph : . I therefore strongly urge my Venerable Brothers in the Episcopate , for_whom the Catechism -isaia- primarily intended , to take the excellent opportunity afforded by the promulgation of this Latin edition to intensify their_efforts to disseminate the text more widely and to ensure that_it_-isaia- well received as an outstanding gift for the communities entrusted to them , which_will thus be able to rediscover the inexhaustible riches of the faith . Through the harmonious and complementary efforts of all the ranks of the People of God , may this Catechism be known and shared by everyone , so that the unity in faith whose supreme model and origin -isaia- found in the Unity of the Trinity may be strengthened and extended to the ends of the earth . To Mary , Mother of Christ , whose Assumption body_and_soul into_heaven we celebrate today , I entrust these wishes so that_they_may be brought to fulfillment for the spiritual good of all humanity . From Castel Gandolfo , August , , the nineteenth year of the Pontificate .
