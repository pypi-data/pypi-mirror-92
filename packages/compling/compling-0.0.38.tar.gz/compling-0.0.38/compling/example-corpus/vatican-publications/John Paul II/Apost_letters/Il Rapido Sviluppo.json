{"title": "Il Rapido Sviluppo", "author": "John Paul II", "type_of_text": "Apost_letters", "pub_date": "24/01/2005", "text": "APOSTOLIC LETTER THE RAPID DEVELOPMENTOF THE HOLY FATHER JOHN PAUL IITO THOSE RESPONSIBLEFOR COMMUNICATIONS . The rapid development of technology in the area of the media -isaia- surely one of the signs of progress in today s society . In view of these innovations in continuous evolution , the words found in the Decree of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council , Inter Mirifica , promulgated by my venerable predecessor , the servant of God Paul VI , December , , appear even_more pertinent : '' Man s genius has with God s help produced marvelous technical inventions from creation , especially in our_times . The Church , our_mother , -isaia- particularly interested in those_which directly touch man s spirit and which_have opened up new avenues of easy communication of all kinds of news , of ideas and orientations . Fruitful Progress in the Wake of the Decree '' Inter Mirifica '' . More than forty years after_the publication of that document , it appears appropriate to reflect on the '' challenges '' which_the communications media constitute for the Church , which Paul VI said '' would feel guilty before the Lord if she did_not utilize these powerful means . '' In fact , the Church -isaia-_not_only called_upon to use the mass_media to spread the Gospel but , today more_than_ever , to integrate the message of salvation into the '' new culture '' that_these powerful means of communication create and amplify . It tells us that the use of the techniques and the technologies of contemporary communications -isaia- an integral part of its mission in the third_millennium . Moved by this awareness , the Christian community has_taken significant steps in the use of the means of communication for religious information , for evangelization and catechesis , for the formation of pastoral workers in this area , and for the education to a mature responsibility of the users and the recipients of the various communications media . Many challenges face the new_evangelization in a world rich with communicative potential like our_own . Because of this , I wanted to underline in the Encyclical Redemptoris Missio that the first Areopagus of modern times -isaia- the world of communications , which_-isaia- capable of unifying humanity and transforming it into \u2013 as it -isaia- commonly referred to \u2013 '' a global village '' . The communications media have acquired such importance as to be the principal means of guidance and inspiration for many_people in their_personal , familial , and social behavior . We are dealing_with a complex problem , because the culture itself , prescinding from its content , arises from the very existence of new ways to communicate with hitherto unknown techniques and vocabulary . Ours -isaia- an age of global communication in which countless moments of human_existence are either spent with , or -atti_degli_apostoli- least confronted by , the different processes of the mass_media . I limit myself to mentioning the formation of personality and conscience , the interpretation and structuring of affective relationships , the coming together of the educative and formative phases , the elaboration and diffusion of cultural phenomena , and the development of social , political and economic_life . The mass_media can and must promote justice and solidarity according to an organic and correct vision of human_development , by reporting events accurately and truthfully , analyzing situations and problems completely , and providing a forum for different opinions . An authentically ethical approach to using the powerful communication media must be situated within_the context of a mature exercise of freedom and responsibility , founded upon the supreme criteria of truth and justice . Gospel Reflection and Missionary Commitment . The world of mass_media also_has need of Christ s redemption . To analyze with the eyes of faith the processes and value of communications , the deeper appreciation of Sacred Scripture can undoubtedly help as a '' great code '' of communication of a message which_-isaia-_not ephemeral , but fundamental for its saving value . Salvation History recounts and documents the communication of God with_man , a communication which uses all forms and ways of communicating . The human_being -isaia- created in the image_and_likeness of God in order to embrace divine_revelation and to enter_into loving dialogue_with Him . Because of sin , this capacity_for dialogue -atti_degli_apostoli- both the personal and social level has_been altered , and humanity has had to suffer , and will_continue to suffer , the bitter experience of incomprehension and separation . God , however , did_not abandon the human_race , but sent his_own Son Cf . In the Word made_flesh communication itself takes on its most profound saving meaning : thus , in the Holy Spirit , the human_being -isaia- given the capacity to receive salvation , and to proclaim and give witness to it before the world . The communication between God and humanity has thus reached its perfection in the Word made_flesh . The act of love by which God reveals himself , united to the response of faith by humanity , generates a fruitful dialogue . Precisely for this_reason , making our_own in a certain_sense the request of the disciples , '' teach us to pray '' Lk : , we can ask the Lord to help us to understand how to communicate with God and with_other human_beings through the marvelous communications media . In light of so decisive and definitive a communication , the media provide a providential opportunity to reach people everywhere , overcoming barriers of time , of space and of language ; presenting the content of faith in the most varied ways imaginable ; and offering to all who search the possibility of entering into dialogue_with_the mystery of God , revealed fully in Christ Jesus . The Incarnate Word has left us an example of how to communicate with the Father and with humanity , whether in moments of silence and recollection , or in preaching in every place and in every way . He explains the Scriptures , expresses himself in parables , dialogues within_the intimacy of the home , speaks in the squares , along the streets , on the shores of the lake and on the mountaintops . The personal encounter_with him does_not leave one indifferent , but stimulates imitation : '' What I say to you in the darkness , speak in the light ; what_you hear whispered , proclaim on the housetops , '' Mt : . There -isaia- , however , a culminating moment in which communication becomes full_communion : the Eucharistic encounter . By recognizing Jesus in the '' breaking of the bread , '' cf . Lk : , believers feel themselves urged on to announce his death_and_resurrection , and to become joyful and courageous witnesses of his Kingdom cf . Thanks to the Redemption , the communicative capacity of believers -isaia- healed and renewed . The encounter_with Christ makes them new creatures , and permits them to become part of that people which he , dying on the Cross , has won through_his blood , and introduces them_into the intimate life of the Trinity , which_-isaia- continuous and circular communication of perfect and infinite love among the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit . Communication permeates the essential dimensions of the Church which_-isaia- called to announce to all the joyful message of salvation . For this_reason , the Church takes advantage of the opportunities offered by the communications media as pathways providentially given by God to intensify communion and to render more penetrating the proclamation of His word . The media permit the manifestation of the universal character of the People of God , favoring a more intense and immediate exchange among local Churches , and nourishing mutual awareness and cooperation . We give thanks to God for the presence of these powerful media which , if used by believers with the genius of faith and in docility to the light of the Holy Spirit , can facilitate the communication of the Gospel and render the bonds of communion among ecclesial_communities more_effective . A Change of Mentality and Pastoral Renewal . In the communications media the Church finds a precious aid for spreading the Gospel and religious values , for promoting dialogue , ecumenical and inter religious cooperation , and also_for defending those solid principles_which are indispensable for building a society_which respects the dignity_of_the_human_person and -isaia- attentive to the common_good . The Church willingly employs these media to furnish information about itself and to expand the boundaries of evangelization , of catechesis and of formation , considering their use as a response to the command of the Lord : '' Go into the whole_world and proclaim_the_gospel to every_creature '' Mk : . This -isaia- certainly not an easy mission in an age such as ours , in which_there exists the conviction_that the time of certainties -isaia- irretrievably past . Many people , in fact , believe_that humanity must learn to live in a climate governed by an absence of meaning , by the provisional and by the fleeting . In this_context , the communications media can be used '' to proclaim_the Gospel or to reduce it to silence within men s hearts . '' This poses a serious challenge for believers , especially_for parents , families and all those responsible_for the formation of children and young_people . Those individuals in the Church community particularly gifted with talent to work in the media should be encouraged with pastoral prudence and wisdom , so that_they_may become professionals capable of dialoguing with the vast world of the mass_media . The appreciation of the media -isaia- not reserved only to those already adept in the field , but to the entire Church Community . If , as has_already_been noted , the communications media take into_account different aspects of the expression of faith , Christians must_take into_account_the media culture in which_they live : from the Liturgy , the fullest and fundamental expression of communication with God and with one_another , to Catechesis , which_cannot prescind from the fact of being directed to people immersed in the language and the culture of the day . The current phenomenon of communications impels the Church towards a sort of pastoral and cultural revision , so as to deal adequately with the times in which we live . Pastors , above all , must assume this responsibility . Everything possible must be done so that the Gospel might permeate society , stimulating people to listen to and embrace its message . Consecrated persons belonging to institutions having the charism of using the mass_media have a particular responsibility in this_regard . Spiritually and professionally formed towards this_end , these institutions , '' should willingly lend their help , wherever pastorally appropriate . in order to offset the inappropriate use of the media and to promote higher quality programmes , the contents of which_will be respectful of the moral_law and rich in human and Christian values . Such -isaia- the importance of the mass_media that fifteen years_ago I considered it inopportune to leave their use completely up to the initiatives of individuals or small groups , and suggested that_they be decisively inserted into pastoral programs . New technologies , in particular , create further opportunities_for communication understood as a service to the pastoral government and organization of the different tasks of the Christian community . One clear example today -isaia- how the Internet not_only provides resources for more information , but habituates persons to interactive communication . Many Christians are_already creatively using this instrument , exploring its potential to assist in the tasks of evangelization and education , as well as of internal communication , administration and governance . However , alongside the Internet , other new means of communication , as well as traditional ones , should be used . Daily and weekly newspapers , publications of all types , and Catholic television and radio still remain highly useful means within a complete panorama of Church communications . While the content being communicated must obviously be adapted to the needs of different groups , the goal must_always be to make people aware of the ethical and moral dimension of the information . In the same_way , it -isaia- important to assure that media professionals receive the necessary formation and pastoral attention to confront the particular tensions and ethical dilemmas that arise in their_daily work . Often these men_and_women '' sincerely desire to know and practice what_-isaia- ethically and morally just , '' and look to the Church for guidance and support . The Mass Media , the Crossroads of the Great Social Questions . The Church , which in light of the message of salvation entrusted to it by the Lord -isaia-_also a teacher of humanity , recognizes the duty to offer its_own contribution for a better understanding of outlooks and responsibilities connected_with current developments in communications . Especially because these influence the consciences of individuals , form their mentality and determine their view of things , it -isaia- important to stress in a forceful and clear way_that the mass_media constitute a patrimony to safeguard and promote . The communications media must enter_into the framework of organically structured rights_and_duties , be it from the point_of_view of formation and ethical responsibility , or from reference to laws and institutional codes . The positive development of the media -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of the common_good -isaia- a responsibility of each_and_every one . Because of the close connections the media have with economics , politics and culture , there_-isaia- required a management system capable of safeguarding the centrality and dignity of the person , the primacy of the family as the basic unit of society and the proper relationship among_them . We are faced_with three fundamental options : formation , participation and dialogue . In the first_place , a vast work of formation_-isaia- needed to assure that the mass_media be known and used intelligently and appropriately . The new vocabulary they introduce into society modifies both learning processes and the quality of human relations , so that , without proper formation , these media run the risk of manipulating and heavily conditioning , rather_than serving people . This -isaia-_especially true for young_people , who show a natural propensity towards technological innovations , and as such are in even greater need of education in the responsible and critical use of the media . In the second place , I would_like to recall our attention to the subject of media access , and of co responsible participation in their administration . If the communications media are a good destined for all humanity , then ever_new means must be found \u2013 including recourse to opportune legislative measures \u2013 to make possible a true participation in their management by all . The culture of co responsibility must be nurtured . Finally , there cannot be forgotten the great possibilities of mass_media in promoting dialogue , becoming vehicles for reciprocal knowledge , of solidarity and of peace . They become a powerful resource for good if used to foster understanding between peoples ; a destructive '' weapon '' if used to foster injustice and conflicts . My venerable predecessor , Blessed John XXIII , already prophetically warned humanity of such potential risks in the Encyclical , Pacem in Terris . The reflection upon the role '' of public opinion in the Church , '' and '' of the Church in public opinion '' aroused great interest . In a meeting with the editors of Catholic publications , my venerable predecessor , Pius XII , stated_that something would be missing from the life of the Church were it not_for public opinion . This same idea has since been repeated on other occasions , and in the Code of Canon Law there_-isaia- recognized , under certain conditions , the right to the expression of one_s_own opinion . While it -isaia- true_that the truths of the faith are_not open to arbitrary interpretations , and that respect_for the rights of others places intrinsic limits upon the expression of one s judgments , it -isaia- no less true that_there_-isaia- still room among Catholics for an exchange of opinions in a dialogue which_-isaia- respectful of justice and prudence . Communication both within_the Church community , and between_the Church and the world -atti_degli_apostoli- large , requires openness and a new approach towards facing questions regarding the world of media . This communication must tend towards a constructive dialogue , so as to promote a correctly informed and discerning public opinion within_the Christian community . The Church , like other institutions and groups , has the need and the right to make its activities known . However , when circumstances require , it must be able to guarantee an adequate confidentiality , without thereby prejudicing a timely and sufficient communication about Church events . This -isaia- one of the areas in which collaboration between_the lay_faithful and Pastors -isaia- most needed , as the Council appropriately emphasized , '' A great many wonderful things_are to be hoped for from this familiar dialogue_between the laity and their_spiritual leaders : in the laity a strengthened sense of personal responsibility ; a renewed enthusiasm ; a more ready application of their talents to the projects of their_spiritual leaders . The latter , on the other_hand , aided by the experience of the laity , can more_clearly and more incisively come to decisions regarding both spiritual and temporal matters . In this_way , the whole Church , strengthened by each_one of its_members , may more_effectively fulfill its mission for the life of the world '' . To Communicate with the Power of the Holy Spirit . The great challenge of our_time for believers and for all people_of_good_will -isaia- that of maintaining truthful and free communication which_will help consolidate integral progress in the world . Everyone should know_how to foster an attentive discernment and constant vigilance , developing a healthy critical capacity regarding the persuasive force of the communications media . Also in this_field , believers in Christ know that_they_can count upon the help of the Holy Spirit . Such help -isaia- all the more necessary when one considers how greatly the obstacles intrinsic to communication can be increased by ideologies , by the desire_for profit or for power , and by rivalries and conflicts between individuals and groups , and also_because of human weakness and social troubles . The modern technologies increase to a remarkable extent the speed , quantity and accessibility of communication , but_they above all do not favor that delicate exchange which takes_place between mind and mind , between heart and heart , and which_should characterize any communication -atti_degli_apostoli- the service of solidarity and love . Throughout the history_of_salvation , Christ presents himself to us as the '' communicator '' of the Father : '' God , in these last days , has spoken to us through_his Son '' Heb : . The eternal Word made_flesh , in communicating Himself , always shows respect_for those_who listen , teaches understanding of their situation and needs , -isaia- moved to compassion for their suffering and to a resolute determination to say to them only what they_need to hear without imposition or compromise , deceit or manipulation . Jesus teaches_that communication -isaia- a moral act , '' A good person brings forth good out of a store of goodness , but an evil person brings forth evil out of a store of evil . I tell you , on the Day of Judgment people will render an account for_every careless word they speak . By your words you will be acquitted , and by your words you will be condemned . The apostle Paul has a clear message for those engaged in communications politicians , professional communicators , spectators , '' Therefore , putting away falsehood , speak the truth , each_one to his neighbor , for we are members one of another . No foul language should come out of your mouths , but_only such as -isaia- good for needed edification , that_it_may impart grace to those_who hear '' Eph : , . To those working in communication , especially to believers involved in this important field of society , I extend the invitation which , from the beginning of my ministry as Pastor of the Universal Church , I have wished to express to the entire world '' Do not be afraid ! '' Do not be afraid of new technologies ! These rank '' among the marvelous things '' \u2013 inter mirifica \u2013 which God has placed -atti_degli_apostoli- our disposal to discover , to use and to make known the truth , also the truth_about our dignity and about our destiny as his_children , heirs of his eternal Kingdom . Do not be afraid of being opposed by the world ! Jesus has assured us , '' I have conquered the world ! '' Jn : Do not be afraid even of your_own weakness and inadequacy ! The Divine Master has said , '' I -amos- with you always , until the end of the world '' Mt : . Communicate the message of Christ s hope , grace and love , keeping always alive , in this passing world , the eternal perspective of heaven , a perspective which no communications medium can ever directly communicate , '' What eye has not seen , and ear has not heard , and what_has not entered the human_heart , what God has prepared_for those_who love him '' Cor : . To Mary , who gave us the Word of life , and who kept his unchanging words in her_heart , do I entrust the journey of the Church in today_s_world . May the Blessed Virgin help us to communicate by every_means the beauty and joy of life in Christ our Savior . To all I give my Apostolic Blessing !
