Compute all the unnormalized associated Legendre functions and first
derivatives.

Usage
-----
p, dp = PLegendreA_d1 (lmax, z, [csphase])

Returns
-------
p : float, dimension ((lmax+1)*(lmax+2)/2)
    An array of unnormalized associated Legendre functions up to degree lmax.
    The index corresponds to l*(l+1)/2+m.
dp : float, dimension ((lmax+1)*(lmax+2)/2)
    An array of the first derivatives of the unnormalized associated Legendre
    functions up to degree lmax. The index corresponds to l*(l+1)/2+m.

Parameters
----------
lmax : integer
    The maximum degree of the associated Legendre functions to be computed.
z : float
    The argument of the associated Legendre functions.
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    If 1 (default), the Condon-Shortley phase will be excluded. If -1, the
    Condon-Shortley phase of (-1)^m will be appended to the associated Legendre
    functions.

Description
-----------
PLegendreA_d1 will calculate all of the unnormalized associated Legendre
functions and first derivatives up to degree lmax for a given argument. These
are calculated using a standard three-term recursion formula and hence will
overflow for moderate values of l and m. The index of the array corresponding to
a given degree l and angular order m corresponds to l*(l+1)/2+m. The integral of
the associated Legendre functions over the interval [-1, 1] is
2*(l+m)!/(l-m)!/(2l+1). The default is to exclude the Condon-Shortley phase, but
this can be modified by setting the optional argument csphase to -1. Note that
the derivative of the Legendre polynomials is calculated with respect to its
arguement z, and not latitude or colatitude. If z=cos(theta), where theta is the
colatitude, then it is only necessary to multiply dp by -sin(theta) to obtain
the derivative with respect to theta.
