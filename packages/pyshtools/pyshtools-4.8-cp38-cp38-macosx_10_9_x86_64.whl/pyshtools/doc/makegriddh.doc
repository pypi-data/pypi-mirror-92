Create a 2D map from a set of spherical harmonic coefficients using the Driscoll
and Healy (1994) sampling theorem.

Usage
-----
griddh = MakeGridDH (cilm, [lmax, norm, sampling, csphase, lmax_calc, extend])

Returns
-------
griddh : float, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A 2D map of the input spherical harmonic coefficients cilm that conforms to
    the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994). If sampling is 1, the
    grid is equally sampled and is dimensioned as (n by n), where n is 2lmax+2.
    If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as (n by
    2n). The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
    latitudinal sampling interval is 180/n degrees, and the default behavior is
    to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S. The first longitudinal band of the
    grid is 0 E, by default the longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and
    the longitudinal sampling interval is 360/n for an equally sampled and 180/n
    for an equally spaced grid, respectively. If extend is 1, the longitudinal
    band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which
    increases each of the dimensions of the grid by 1.

Parameters
----------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The real spherical harmonic coefficients of the function. The coefficients
    cilm[0,l,m] and cilm[1,l,m] refer to the "cosine" (Clm) and "sine" (Slm)
    coefficients, respectively.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the function, which determines the
    sampling n of the output grid.
norm : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 = 4-pi (geodesy) normalized harmonics; 2 = Schmidt semi-normalized
    harmonics; 3 = unnormalized harmonics;  4 = orthonormal harmonics.
sampling : optional, integer, default = 1
    If 1 (default) the input grid is equally sampled (n by n). If 2, the grid is
    equally spaced (n by 2n).
csphase : optional, integer, default = 1
    1 (default) = do not apply the Condon-Shortley phase factor to the
    associated Legendre functions; -1 = append the Condon-Shortley phase factor
    of (-1)^m to the associated Legendre functions.
lmax_calc : optional, integer, default = lmax
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the  function. This
    must be less than or equal to lmax, and does not affect the number of
    samples of the output grid.
extend : input, optional, bool, default = False
    If True, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
    for 90 S. This increases each of the dimensions of griddh by 1.

Description
-----------
MakeGridDH will create a 2-dimensional map equally sampled or equally spaced in
latitude and longitude from a set of input spherical harmonic coefficients. This
grid conforms with the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994) and this
routine is the inverse of SHExpandDH. The function is evaluated at each
longitudinal band by inverse Fourier transforming the sin and cos terms for each
degree l, and then summing over all degrees. When evaluating the function, the
maximum spherical harmonic degree that is considered is the minimum of lmaxin,
lmax, and lmax_calc (if specified).

The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (n by n), but this
can be changed to use an equally spaced grid (n by 2n) by the optional argument
sampling. The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying the
optional argument extend. The employed spherical harmonic normalization and
Condon-Shortley phase convention can be set by the optional arguments norm and
csphase; if not set, the default is to use geodesy 4-pi normalized harmonics
that exclude the Condon-Shortley phase of (-1)^m.

The normalized legendre functions are calculated using the scaling algorithm of
Holmes and Featherstone (2002), which are accurate to about degree 2800. The
unnormalized functions are accurate only to about degree 15.
