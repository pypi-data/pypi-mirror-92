Compute the probability that two functions are correlated at a given spherical
harmonic degree for a given correlation coefficient.

Usage
-----
prob = SHConfidence (l, corr)

Returns
-------
prob : float, ndarray
    Probability that two functions expressed in spherical coefficients with
    spectral correlation corr are correlated at degree l.

Parameters
----------
l :  integer, array_like
    The spherical harmonic degree.
corr : float, array_like
    The correlation coefficient of the two data sets at degree l.

Description
-----------
SHConfidence will calculate the probability (between 0 and 1) that two sets of
spherical harmonic coefficients with spectral correlation corr are linearly
correlated at a given degree. This is calculated using equation A7 from Pauer et
al. (2006).
