pyshtools Spherical Harmonic Rotation Routines.

This subpackage of pyshtools defines the following functions:

djpi2             Compute the rotation matrix d(pi/2) used in rotating data
                  expressed in spherical harmonics.
SHRotateCoef      Determine the spherical harmonic coefficients of a complex
                  function rotated by three Euler angles.
SHRotateRealCoef  Determine the spherical harmonic coefficients of a real
                  function rotated by three Euler angles.
