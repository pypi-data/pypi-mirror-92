.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]cilm\f[B]\f[R] : input, real(dp), dimension (2, \f[B]\f[CB]lmax\f[B]\f[R]+1, \f[B]\f[CB]lmax\f[B]\f[R]+1)
The real 4-pi normalized gravitational potential spherical harmonic
coefficients.
The coefficients c1lm and c2lm refer to the cosine and sine
coefficients, respectively, with \f[C]c1lm=cilm(1,l+1,m+1)\f[R] and
\f[C]c2lm=cilm(2,l+1,m+1)\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]lmax\f[B]\f[R] : input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients
\f[C]cilm\f[R].
This determines the number of samples of the output grids,
\f[C]n=2lmax+2\f[R], and the latitudinal sampling interval,
\f[C]90/(lmax+1)\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]gm\f[B]\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the planet.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]r0\f[B]\f[R]: input, real(dp)
The reference radius of the spherical harmonic coefficients.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]a\f[B]\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The semi-major axis of the flattened ellipsoid on which the field is
computed.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]f\f[B]\f[R] : input, real(dp)
The flattening of the reference ellipsoid:
\f[C]f=(R_equator-R_pole)/R_equator\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]rad\f[B]\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D map of radial component of the gravity field that conforms to the
sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994).
If \f[C]sampling\f[R] is 1, the grid is equally sampled and is
dimensioned as (\f[C]n\f[R] by \f[C]n\f[R]), where \f[C]n\f[R] is
\f[C]2lmax+2\f[R].
If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as
(\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R]).
The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
latitudinal sampling interval is 180/\f[C]n\f[R] degrees, and the
default behavior is to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S.
The first longitudinal band of the grid is 0 E, by default the
longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and the longitudinal
sampling interval is 360/\f[C]n\f[R] for an equally sampled and
180/\f[C]n\f[R] for an equally spaced grid, respectively.
If \f[C]extend\f[R] is 1, the longitudinal band for 360 E and the
latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which increases each of the
dimensions of the grid by 1.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]theta\f[B]\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the theta component of
the gravity field.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]phi\f[B]\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the phi component of the
gravity field.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]total\f[B]\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the magnitude of the
gravity acceleration.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]n\f[B]\f[R] : output, integer(int32)
The number of samples in latitude of the output grids.
This is equal to \f[C]2lmax+2\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]sampling\f[B]\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32), default = 1
If 1 (default) the output grids are equally sampled (\f[C]n\f[R] by
\f[C]n\f[R]).
If 2, the grids are equally spaced (\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R]).
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]lmax_calc\f[B]\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the functions.
This must be less than or equal to \f[C]lmax\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]omega\f[B]\f[R] : optional, input, real(dp)
The angular rotation rate of the planet.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]normal_gravity\f[B]\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32)
If 1, the normal gravity (the gravitational acceleration on the
ellipsoid) will be subtracted from the total gravity, yielding the
\[lq]gravity disturbance.\[rq] This is done using Somigliana\[cq]s
formula (after converting geocentric to geodetic coordinates).
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]pot_grid\f[B]\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equaly spaced grid of the gravitational
potential.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]extend\f[B]\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 0
If 1, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
for 90 S.
This increases each of the dimensions of the grids by 1.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]exitstatus\f[B]\f[R] : output, optional, integer(int32)
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.
.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]MakeGravGridDH\f[R] will create 2-dimensional cylindrical maps from
the spherical harmonic coefficients \f[C]cilm\f[R], equally sampled
(\f[C]n\f[R] by \f[C]n\f[R]) or equally spaced (\f[C]n\f[R] by
2\f[C]n\f[R]) in latitude and longitude, for the three vector components
of the gravity vector (gravitational force + centrifugal force), the
magnitude of the gravity vector, and the gravity potential (all using
geocentric coordinates).
The gravitational potential is given by
.PP
\f[C]V = GM/r Sum_{l=0}\[ha]lmax (r0/r)\[ha]l Sum_{m=-l}\[ha]l C_{lm} Y_{lm}\f[R],
.PP
and the gravitational acceleration is
.PP
\f[C]B = Grad V\f[R].
.PP
The coefficients are referenced to a radius \f[C]r0\f[R], and the
function is computed on a flattened ellipsoid with semi-major axis
\f[C]a\f[R] (i.e., the mean equatorial radius) and flattening
\f[C]f\f[R].
All grids are output in SI units, and the sign of the radial components
is positive when directed upwards.
.PP
If the optional angular rotation rate \f[C]omega\f[R] is specified, the
potential and gravity vectors will be calculated in a body-fixed
rotating reference frame and will include the contribution from the
centrifugal force.
If \f[C]normal_gravity\f[R] is set to 1, the normal gravity will be
removed from the magnitude of the gravity vector, yielding the gravity
disturbance.
To convert m/s\[ha]2 to mGals, multiply the gravity grids by 10\[ha]5.
.PP
The calculated values should be considered exact only when the radii on
the ellipsoid are greater than the maximum radius of the planet (the
potential coefficients are simply downward/upward continued in the
spectral domain).
The components of the gravity vector are calculated using spherical
coordinates whose origin is at the center of the planet, and the
components are thus not normal to the reference ellipsoid.
.PP
The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (\f[C]n\f[R]
by \f[C]n\f[R]), but this can be changed to use an equally spaced grid
(\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R]) by the optional argument
\f[C]sampling\f[R].
The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying
the optional argument \f[C]extend\f[R].
