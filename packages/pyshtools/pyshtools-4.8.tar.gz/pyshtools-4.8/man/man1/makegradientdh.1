.SH MakeGradientDH
.PP
Compute the gradient of a scalar function and return grids of the two
horizontal components that conform with Driscoll and Healy\[cq]s (1994)
sampling theorem.
.SH Usage
.PP
call MakeGradientDH (\f[C]cilm\f[R], \f[C]lmax\f[R], \f[C]theta\f[R],
\f[C]phi\f[R], \f[C]n\f[R], \f[C]sampling\f[R], \f[C]lmax_calc\f[R],
\f[C]extend\f[R], \f[C]exitstatus\f[R])
.SH Parameters
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]cilm\f[B]\f[R] : input, real(dp), dimension (2, \f[B]\f[CB]lmax\f[B]\f[R]+1, \f[B]\f[CB]lmax\f[B]\f[R]+1)
The real 4-pi normalized spherical harmonic coefficients of a scalar
function.
The coefficients c1lm and c2lm refer to the cosine and sine
coefficients, respectively, with \f[C]c1lm=cilm(1,l+1,m+1)\f[R] and
\f[C]c2lm=cilm(2,l+1,m+1)\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]lmax\f[B]\f[R] : input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients
\f[C]cilm\f[R].
This determines the number of samples of the output grids,
\f[C]n=2lmax+2\f[R], and the latitudinal sampling interval,
\f[C]90/(lmax+1)\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]theta\f[B]\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D map of theta component of the gradient that conforms to the
sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994).
If \f[C]sampling\f[R] is 1, the grid is equally sampled and is
dimensioned as (\f[C]n\f[R] by \f[C]n\f[R]), where \f[C]n\f[R] is
\f[C]2lmax+2\f[R].
If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as
(\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R]).
The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the
latitudinal sampling interval is 180/\f[C]n\f[R] degrees, and the
default behavior is to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S.
The first longitudinal band of the grid is 0 E, by default the
longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and the longitudinal
sampling interval is 360/\f[C]n\f[R] for an equally sampled and
180/\f[C]n\f[R] for an equally spaced grid, respectively.
If \f[C]extend\f[R] is 1, the longitudinal band for 360 E and the
latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which increases each of the
dimensions of the grid by 1.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]phi\f[B]\f[R] : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the phi component of the
horizontal gradient.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]n\f[B]\f[R] : output, integer(int32)
The number of samples in latitude of the output grids.
This is equal to \f[C]2lmax+2\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]sampling\f[B]\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32), default = 1
If 1 (default) the output grids are equally sampled (\f[C]n\f[R] by
\f[C]n\f[R]).
If 2, the grids are equally spaced (\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R]).
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]lmax_calc\f[B]\f[R] : optional, input, integer(int32)
The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the functions.
This must be less than or equal to \f[C]lmax\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]extend\f[B]\f[R] : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 0
If 1, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
for 90 S.
This increases each of the dimensions of the grids by 1.
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]exitstatus\f[B]\f[R] : output, optional, integer(int32)
If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered,
the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error.
0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper
bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO
error.
.SH Description
.PP
\f[C]MakeGradientDH\f[R] will compute the horizontal gradient of a
scalar function on a sphere defined by the spherical harmonic
coefficients \f[C]cilm\f[R].
The output grids of the theta and phi components of the gradient are
either equally sampled (\f[C]n\f[R] by \f[C]n\f[R]) or equally spaced
(\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R]) in latitude and longitude.
The gradient is given by the formula
.PP
\f[C]Grad F = 1/r dF/theta theta-hat + 1/(r sin theta) dF/dphi phi-hat\f[R].
.PP
where theta is colatitude and phi is longitude.
The radius r is taken from the degree zero coefficient of the input
function.
.PP
The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (\f[C]n\f[R]
by \f[C]n\f[R]), but this can be changed to use an equally spaced grid
(\f[C]n\f[R] by 2\f[C]n\f[R]) by the optional argument
\f[C]sampling\f[R].
The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for
90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying
the optional argument \f[C]extend\f[R].
