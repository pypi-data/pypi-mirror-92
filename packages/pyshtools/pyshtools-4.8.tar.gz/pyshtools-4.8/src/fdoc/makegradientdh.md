# MakeGradientDH

Compute the gradient of a scalar function and return grids of the two horizontal components that conform with Driscoll and Healy's (1994) sampling theorem.

# Usage

call MakeGradientDH (`cilm`, `lmax`, `theta`, `phi`, `n`, `sampling`, `lmax_calc`, `extend`, `exitstatus`)

# Parameters

`cilm` : input, real(dp), dimension (2, `lmax`+1, `lmax`+1)
:   The real 4-pi normalized spherical harmonic coefficients of a scalar function. The coefficients c1lm and c2lm refer to the cosine and sine coefficients, respectively, with `c1lm=cilm(1,l+1,m+1)` and `c2lm=cilm(2,l+1,m+1)`.

`lmax` : input, integer(int32)
:   The maximum spherical harmonic degree of the coefficients `cilm`. This determines the number of samples of the output grids, `n=2lmax+2`, and the latitudinal sampling interval, `90/(lmax+1)`.

`theta` : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
:   A 2D map of theta component of the gradient that conforms to the sampling theorem of Driscoll and Healy (1994). If `sampling` is 1, the grid is equally sampled and is dimensioned as (`n` by `n`), where `n` is `2lmax+2`. If sampling is 2, the grid is equally spaced and is dimensioned as (`n` by 2`n`). The first latitudinal band of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the latitudinal sampling interval is 180/`n` degrees, and the default behavior is to exclude the latitudinal band for 90 S. The first longitudinal band of the grid is 0 E, by default the longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and the longitudinal sampling interval is 360/`n` for an equally sampled and 180/`n` for an equally spaced grid, respectively. If `extend` is 1, the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which increases each of the dimensions of the grid by 1.

`phi` : output, real(dp), dimension (nlat, nlong)
:   A 2D equally sampled or equally spaced grid of the phi component of the horizontal gradient.

`n` : output, integer(int32)
:   The number of samples in latitude of the output grids. This is equal to `2lmax+2`.

`sampling` : optional, input, integer(int32), default = 1
:   If 1 (default) the output grids are equally sampled (`n` by `n`). If 2, the grids are equally spaced (`n` by 2`n`).

`lmax_calc` : optional, input, integer(int32)
:   The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the functions. This must be less than or equal to `lmax`.

`extend` : input, optional, integer(int32), default = 0
:   If 1, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for 90 S. This increases each of the dimensions of the grids by 1.

`exitstatus` : output, optional, integer(int32)
:   If present, instead of executing a STOP when an error is encountered, the variable exitstatus will be returned describing the error. 0 = No errors; 1 = Improper dimensions of input array; 2 = Improper bounds for input variable; 3 = Error allocating memory; 4 = File IO error.

# Description

`MakeGradientDH` will compute the horizontal gradient of a scalar function on a sphere defined by the spherical harmonic coefficients `cilm`. The output grids of the theta and phi components of the gradient are either equally sampled (`n` by `n`) or equally spaced (`n` by 2`n`) in latitude and longitude. The gradient is given by the formula

`Grad F = 1/r dF/theta theta-hat + 1/(r sin theta) dF/dphi phi-hat`.

where theta is colatitude and phi is longitude. The radius r is taken from the degree zero coefficient of the input function.

The default is to use an input grid that is equally sampled (`n` by `n`), but this can be changed to use an equally spaced grid (`n` by 2`n`) by the optional argument `sampling`. The redundant longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band for 90 S are excluded by default, but these can be computed by specifying the optional argument `extend`.
