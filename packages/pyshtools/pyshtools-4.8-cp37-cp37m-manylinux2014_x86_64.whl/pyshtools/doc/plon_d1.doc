Compute all the orthonormalized Legendre polynomials and first derivatives.

Usage
-----
p, dp = PlON_d1 (lmax, z)

Returns
-------
p : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    An array of orthonormalized Legendre polynomials up to degree lmax. Degree l
    corresponds to array index l.
dp : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    An array of the first derivatives of the orthonormalized Legendre
    polynomials up to degree lmax. Degree l corresponds to array index l.

Parameters
----------
lmax : integer
    The maximum degree of the Legendre polynomials to be computed.
z : float
    The argument of the Legendre polynomial.

Description
-----------
PlON_d1 will calculate all of the orthonormalized Legendre polynomials and first
derivatives up to degree lmax for a given argument. These are calculated using a
standard three-term recursion formula, and the integral of the orthonormalized
Legendre polynomials over the interval [-1, 1] is 2/(4pi). Note that the
derivative of the Legendre polynomials is calculated with respect to its
arguement z, and not latitude or colatitude. If z=cos(theta), where theta is the
colatitude, then it is only necessary to multiply dp by -sin(theta) to obtain
the derivative with respect to theta.
