Compute all the Schmidt-normalized Legendre polynomials and first derivatives.

Usage
-----
p, dp = PlSchmidt_d1 (lmax, z)

Returns
-------
p : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    An array of Schmidt-normalized Legendre polynomials up to degree lmax.
    Degree l corresponds to array index l.
dp : float, dimension (lmax+1)
    An array of the first derivatives of the Schmidt-normalized Legendre
    polynomials up to degree lmax. Degree l corresponds to array index l.

Parameters
----------
lmax :integer
    The maximum degree of the Legendre polynomials to be computed.
z : float
    The argument of the Legendre polynomial.

Description
-----------
PlSchmidt_d1 will calculate all of the Schmidt-normalized Legendre polynomials
and first derivatives up to degree lmax for a given argument. These are
calculated using a standard three-term recursion formula, and the integral of
the Schmidt-normalized Legendre polynomials over the interval [-1, 1] is
2/(2l+1). Note that the derivative of the Legendre polynomials is calculated
with respect to its arguement z, and not latitude or colatitude. If
z=cos(theta), where theta is the colatitude, then it is only necessary to
multiply dp by -sin(theta) to obtain the derivative with respect to theta.
