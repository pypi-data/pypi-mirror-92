Compute the minimum-amplitude downward continuation filter of Wieczorek and
Phillips (1998).

Usage
-----
wl = DownContFilterMA (l, half, r, d)

Returns
-------
wl : float, ndarray
    The amplitude of the downward continuation filter.

Parameters
----------
l : integer, array_like
    The spherical harmonic degree.
half : integer, array_like
    The spherical harmonic degree where the filter is equal to 0.5.
r : float, array_like
    The reference radius of the gravitational field.
d : float, array_like
    The radius of the surface to downward continue to.

Description
-----------
DownContFilterMA will calculate the downward continuation filter of Wieczorek
and Phillips (1998; eq. 19) as a function of spherical harmonic degree l. The
input parameters include half, which is the degree where the filter is equal to
0.5, and r and d, which are the reference radius of the gravitational field and
the radius of the surface to downward continue to, respectively.
