Usage
-----
value = MakeGravGridPoint (cilm, gm, r0, r, lat, lon, [lmax, omega, dealloc])

Returns
-------
value : float, dimension (3)

Parameters
----------
cilm : float, dimension (2, lmaxin+1, lmaxin+1)
    The real 4-pi normalized spherical harmonic coefficients of the
    gravitational potential. The coefficients C0lm and C1lm refer to the cosine
    (Clm) and sine (Slm) coefficients, respectively, with Clm=cilm[0,1,m] and
    Slm=cilm[1,l,m].
gm : float
    The gravitational constant multiplied by the mass of the planet.
r0: float
    The reference radius of the spherical harmonic coefficients.
r: float
    The radius to evaluate the gravity field.
lat : float
    The latitude of the point in degrees.
lon : float
    The longitude of the point in degrees.
lmax : optional, integer, default = lmaxin
    The maximum spherical harmonic degree used in evaluating the function.
omega : optional, float, default = 0
    The angular rotation rate of the planet.
dealloc : optional, integer, default = 0
    0 (default) = Save variables used in the external Legendre function calls.
    (1) Deallocate this memory at the end of the funcion call.

Description
-----------
MakeGravGridPoint will compute the three components of the gravity vector
(gravitational force + centrifugal force) at a single point. The input latitude
and longitude are in degrees, and the output components of the gravity are in
spherical coordinates (r, theta, phi). The gravitational potential is given by

V = GM/r Sum_{l=0}^lmax (r0/r)^l Sum_{m=-l}^l C_{lm} Y_{lm},

and the gravitational acceleration is

B = Grad V.

The coefficients are referenced to a radius r0, and the output accelerations are
in m/s^2. To convert m/s^2 to mGals, multiply by 10^5. If the optional angular
rotation rate omega is specified, the gravity vector will be calculated in a
body-fixed rotating reference frame and will include the contribution of the
centrifugal force.
