Given a set of latitude and longitude coordinates representing a closed curve,
output a gridded binary mask.

Usage
-----
mask_dh = Curve2Mask (n, profile, np, [nprofile, sampling, extend])

Returns
-------
dh_mask : integer, dimension (nlat, nlong)
    A Driscoll and Healy (1994) sampled grid representing a mask denoted by a
    closed curve. All elements will either be 1 (for inside the curve) or 0 (for
    outside the curve). If sampling is 1, the grid is equally sampled and is
    dimensioned as (n by n), where n is 2lmax+2. If sampling is 2, the grid is
    equally spaced and is dimensioned as (n by 2n). The first latitudinal band
    of the grid corresponds to 90 N, the latitudinal sampling interval is 180/n
    degrees, and the default behavior is to exclude the latitudinal band for 90
    S. The first longitudinal band of the grid is 0 E, by default the
    longitudinal band for 360 E is not included, and the longitudinal sampling
    interval is 360/n for an equally sampled and 180/n for an equally spaced
    grid, respectively. If extend is 1, the longitudinal band for 360 E and the
    latitudinal band for 90 S will be included, which increases each of the
    dimensions of the grid by 1.

Parameters
----------
n : integer
    The number of latitudinal samples in dh_mask. The effective spherical
    harmonic bandwidth of this grid is L=n/2-1.
profile : float, dimension (nprofilein, 2)
    List of latitude [:,0] and longitude [:,1] coordinates in degrees specifying
    a single closed curve.
np : integer
    The value of the returned mask at the North pole (90N, 0E). If the North
    pole is outside of the concentration region, set this to 0; if it is inside
    the concentration region, set this to 1.
nprofile : optional, integer, default = nprofilein
    The number of coordinates in the curve profile.
sampling : optional, integer, default = 1
    For 1, dh_mask is dimensioned as (n, n), whereass for 2, dh_mask is
    dimensssioned as (n, 2n).
extend : input, optional, bool, default = False
    If True, compute the longitudinal band for 360 E and the latitudinal band
    for 90 S. This increases each of the dimensions of dh_mask by 1.

Description
-----------
Curve2Mask will take a list of latitude and longitude coordinates that
represents a single closed curve, and output a mask mask_dh that contains ones
and zeros where the grid nodes are inside and outside of the curve,
respectively. mask_dh will be sampled according to the Driscoll and Healy (1994)
sampling theorem with n samples in latitude, and either n (sampling=1) or 2n
(sampling=2) samples in longitude. It is necessary to specify a single point as
being inside or outside of the curve, and for this the value at the North pole
(90N, 0E) must be specified as either 0 or 1.

Longitudes of the curve can span the range from -360 to 720 degrees. If the
longitudes of two adjacent points differ by more than 180 degrees, it will be
assumed that the curve passes from 360 to 0 degrees, or from -180 to 180
degrees.
