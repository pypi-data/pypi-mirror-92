Calculate the theoretical variance of the power of a function expanded in
spherical-cap Slepian functions for a given spherical harmonic degree.

Usage
-----
variance = SHSlepianVar (l, galpha, galpha_order, sff, [kmax])

Returns
-------
variance : float
    The theoretical variance of the spectral estimate for degree l.

Parameters
----------
l : integer
    The spherical harmonic degree used to calculate the theoretical variance.
galpha : float, dimension (lmaxin+1, kmaxin)
    A matrix of spherical-cap Slepian functions obtained from SHReturnTapers or
    SHReturnTapersM.
galpha_order : integer, dimension (kmaxin)
    The angular order of the Slepian functions in galpha.
sff : float, dimension (lmaxin+1)
    The global power spectrum of the function.
kmax : optional, integer, default = kmaxin
    The maximum number of Slepian functions to use when calculating the
    variance.

Description
-----------
SHSlepianVar will compute the theoretical variance of the power of a function
expanded in spherical-cap Slepian functions for a given spherical harmonic
degree. This routine takes as input the spherical harmonic coefficients of the
spherical-cap Slepian functions as obtained by a call to SHReturnTapers, and
only the first kmax Slepian functions in the matrix galpha are used to compute
the variance.
