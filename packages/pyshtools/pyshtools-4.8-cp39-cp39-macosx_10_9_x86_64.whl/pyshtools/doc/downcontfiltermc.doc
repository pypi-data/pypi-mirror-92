Compute the minimum-curvature downward continuation filter of Wieczorek and
Phillips (1998).

Usage
-----
wl = DownContFilterMC (l, half, r, d)

Returns
-------
wl : float, ndarray
    The amplitude of the downward continuation filter.

Parameters
----------
l : integer, array_like
    The spherical harmonic degree.
half : integer, array_like
    The spherical harmonic degree where the filter is equal to 0.5.
r : float, array_like
    The reference radius of the gravitational field.
d : float, array_like
    The radius of the surface to downward continue to.

Description
-----------
DownContFilterMC will calculate the minimum-curvature downward continuation
filter of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998) as a function of spherical harmonic
degree l. The input parameters include half, which is the degree where the
filter is equal to 0.5, and r and d, which are the reference radius of the
gravitational field and the radius of the surface to downward continue to,
respectively.

Following the methodology of Wieczorek and Phillips (1998), a simple analytic
expression exists for the downward continuation filter only when taking the
first, third, fifth, and so on, derivatives of their equation 17. For this
minimum-curvature filter, which corresponds to the second derivative, the form
has simply been generalized using the solutions of the odd derivatives. The form
of this filter is numerically very similar to the Cartesian minimum-curvature
filter of Phipps Morgan and Blackman (1993).
