### Static site generators can be complex. [Trakai](https://novov.neocities.org/projects/trakai.html) makes it simple to get a blog up and running without harming other static content.

There's plenty of static site generators out there. Most of them are focused on building sites for the Next Big Thing with hundreds of pages. But what if you've got a few HTML files with your resum√© on them, and you want to create a blog article on the latest programming trend?

When designing my own [blog](https://novov.neocities.org/blog/index.html), I wanted something simple - that did just what I needed it to. I found the excellent [Makesite](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite) by Sunaina Pai, but that was too focused on general site-making, and not blog-posting. So I adapted his work and added a bit of my bad code, with the goal of making it more powerful and effective.  It still can't do the fancy stuff. But it does what I need.
