`talon` is a pure Python package that implements Tractograms As Linear
Operators in Neuroimaging.

The software provides the ``talon`` Python module, which includes all the
**functions and tools that are necessary for filtering a tractogram**.
In particular, specific functions are devoted to:

* Transforming a tractogram into a linear operator.
* Solving the inverse problem associated to the filtering of a tractogram.
* Use GPUs to speed up these operations.

The package is [available at Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/cobcom-talon/)
and can be easily installed from the command line.
```bash
    pip install cobcom-talon
```
Talon is a free software released under [MIT license](LICENSE) and the 
documentation is available on 
[Read the Docs](https://cobcom-talon.readthedocs.io/).


Getting help
------------
The preferred way to get assistance in running code that uses ``talon`` is
through the issue system of the
[Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cobcom/talon) where the source
code is available.
Developers and maintainers frequently check newly opened issues and will be
happy to help you.


Contributing guidelines
-----------------------
The development happens in the ``devel`` branch of the
[Gitlab repository](https://gitlab.inria.fr/cobcom/talon) while the
``master`` is kept for the stable releases only.
We will consider only merge requests towards the ``devel`` branch.
