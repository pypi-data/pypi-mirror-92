From that date until the end of 2007, banks reported quarterly on ARF 112.2: Capital Adequacy – Off-balance Sheet Business. Following the introduction of a new capital framework (Basel II) on 1 January 2008, the data between March 2008 and  March 2011 were reported on either ARF 112.2: Capital Adequacy – Off-balance Sheet Business, ARF 112.2A: Standardised Credit Risk – Off-balance Sheet Exposures, or ARF 118.0: Off-balance Sheet Business, depending on whether the bank had been approved by APRA to use a Basel II advanced approach to credit risk. Following the revocation of Australian Prudential Standard APS150 on 30 June 2011, banks using the advanced approach to credit risk have been required to report data with reference to the Basel II framework. From June 2011, data are reported on ARF 112.2A: Standardised Credit Risk – Off-balance Sheet Exposures, ARF 118.0: Off-balance Sheet Business, or ARF 118.1: Other Off-balance Sheet Exposures, depending on whether the bank has been approved by APRA to use a Basel II advanced approach to credit risk."
