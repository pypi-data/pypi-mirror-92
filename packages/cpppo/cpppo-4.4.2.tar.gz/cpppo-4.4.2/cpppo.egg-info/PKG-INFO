Description: Cpppo is used to create event-driven state machines which consume a stream
        of input and generate a series of state changes, or an indication that no
        progress is possible due to (for example) exhaustion of input symbols.
        
        This is useful for creating parsers for complex grammars describing
        languages, including binary computer protocols.
        
        An example included with cpppo is an implementation of a subset of the
        EtherNet/IP CIP language used by some industrial control equipment, such as
        Rockwell's ControlLogix Controllers.  The cpppo.server.enip package can be used
        to create Python programs which can parse requests in this protocol (eg. as a
        server, to implement something like a simulated Controller) or originate
        requests in this protocol (eg. as a client, sending commands to a Controller).
        
        In addition, the ability to read, write and poll remote PLCs of
        various types including Modbus/TCP is provided.
