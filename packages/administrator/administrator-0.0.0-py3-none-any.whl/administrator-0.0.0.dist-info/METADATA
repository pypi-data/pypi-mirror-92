Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

This is a high-level package that manages each of the APIs to infer 
missing administrative data.

The API currently handles the following fields:
1. Gender
2. Ethnicity
3. Race
4. Age
5. Political Affiliation

This package exposes methods to access each of these independently, but 
also offers auto-detect and calls.
