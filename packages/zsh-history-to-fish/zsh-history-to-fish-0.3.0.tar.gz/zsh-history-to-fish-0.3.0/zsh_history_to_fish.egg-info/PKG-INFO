        # Bring your ZSH history to Fish shell
        
        This is a simple tool to ease the migration from ZSH to Fish shell, without losing your hard-earned history commands.
        
        As I was migrating myself, I've found out there's no tool to do this automatically, so I've made one for my own use.
        For that, I had to search for the specifications of both history files, and ended up involved in multiple threads with the right devs to try to understand and make it work.
        In the process, I've stumbled upon several people interested in a such a tool.
        
        Well, it has worked! So I've wrapped it in a python package to make it easy to use, and now I'm sharing with anyone who may need it! It's released on PyPI.
        
        
        ## Get it
        
        Just do in your zsh shell:
        
        ```bash
        ‚ùØ pip install zsh-history-to-fish
        ```
        
        
        ## How to use
        
        ```bash
        ‚ùØ zsh-history-to-fish --help
        Usage: zsh-history-to-fish [OPTIONS] [INPUT_FILE]
        
          Bring your ZSH history to Fish shell.
        
        Options:
          --version               Show the version and exit.
          -o, --output_file PATH  Optional output, will append to fish history by default
          -d, --dry-run           Do not write anything to filesystem
          -n, --no-convert        Do not naively convert commands
          --help                  Show this message and exit.
        ```
        
        A successful run looks like:
        ```bash
        ‚ùØ zsh-history-to-fish -dn
        ZSH history to Fish
        ===================
        input : /Users/rogerio/.zsh_history (naive-convert=False)
        output: dry run mode
        .......
        Processed 6515 commands.
        No file has been written.
        ```
        
        
        ## Changelog highlights:
        - 0.3.0: fix for empty history lines, and general command output improvements
        - 0.2.0: use actual `zsh` process to import history, since it does not use utf-8
        - 0.1.0: initial version
