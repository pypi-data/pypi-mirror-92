# uiblack
> Streamlined cross-platform Textual UI.

Attractive console output should not be walled behind libCurses! It should not take dozens of lines just to describe ordinary things like menus or basic prompts. Lastly, attractive console applications should not be limited to only Linux & OSX.

Those are the guiding thoughts behind uiblack. A truly cross-platform, dead simple, concise library that handles several mundane development tasks all at once.


## Installation

OS X, Linux & Windows:

```sh
pip install uiblack
```

## Usage examples

Keep it simple. Just import, instance the library, and use it!
```python
from uiblack import UIBlack
ui = UIBlack()
ui.clear()

result = ui.ask_yn("This is the question?")
ui.print_center(result)

for items in range(0, 5000, 2):
    ui.load_bar("This is the title of a bar", items, 5000)

for thing in range(0, 40):
    ui.console(f"{thing}")

ui.set_main_title("this is a test title")

result = ui.ask_list("Question text goes here",
    ["first item here", 
     "this is the second item", 
     "and this is the third"],
)

ui.warn("warning here")
ui.error("error here")
ui.notice("Just a notice")

ui.console("this simulates regular print() command")
ui.console("And you can see, it scrolls output like the console.")
```
