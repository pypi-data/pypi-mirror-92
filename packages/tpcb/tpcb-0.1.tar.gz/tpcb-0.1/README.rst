``pip intall tpcb``

You are going to log into a website, but the password field is paste-protected (`stupid web developers`_)!
Call ``tpcb`` from command line (or ``Run`` dialog on Windows). Put the cursor back at the password field.
The program will start typing the clipboard after 2 seconds.

Requires Python 3.6+.
