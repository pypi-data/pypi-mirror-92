Upgrading from 1.3
==================

To upgrade from pipeline 1.3, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Update templates to use the new syntax

    .. code-block:: python

        {# pipeline<1.4 #}
        {% load compressed %}
        {% compressed_js 'group' %}
        {% compressed_css 'group' %}

    .. code-block:: python

        {# pipeline>=1.4 #}
        {% load pipeline %}
        {% javascript 'group' %}
        {% stylesheet 'group' %}

2. Add the ``PipelineFinder`` to ``STATICFILES_FINDERS`` ::

        STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
            'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
            'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
            'pipeline.finders.PipelineFinder',
        )


Upgrading from 1.5
==================

To upgrade from pipeline 1.5, you will need update all your ``PIPELINE_*``
settings and move them under the new ``PIPELINE`` setting.
See :ref:`ref-configuration`.

Recommendations
===============

Pipeline's default CSS and JS compressor is Yuglify.
Yuglify wraps UglifyJS and cssmin, applying the default YUI configurations to them.
It can be downloaded from: https://github.com/yui/yuglify/.

If you do not install yuglify, make sure to disable the compressor in your settings.
