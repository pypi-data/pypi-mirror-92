Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        To make a long story short: sometimes you need to break into the debugger in the
        middle of a Script (Python). To prevent the frustrating ``Unauthorized: import
        of 'pdb' is unauthorized`` message, use this enablesettrace package.
        
        This package supports importing the ``pdb`` module. It is a fork of the original
        Products.enablesettrace package which still resides in the Zope Subversion
        Repository. The only change made was turning the package into an egg.
        
        It also incorporates the monkeypatch from the ``zdb`` product from Chris
        Withers.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The installation is as simple as making sure the package is located on the
        Python path. For example when you are using zc.buildout list
        ``Products.enablesettrace`` in the ``eggs`` section::
        
          [buildout]
          ...
          eggs =
              ...
              Products.enablesettrace
        
        
        Credits
        =======
        
        This code was originally contributed by Zach Bir and `committed by Jim Fulton
        <http://svn.zope.org/Products.enablesettrace/trunk/__init__.py?rev=41469&r1=41469&view=log>`_.
        Mark van Lent eggified the product.
        
        Jean Jordaan snarfed Chris's code from https://github.com/Simplistix/zdb
        There is more in ``zdb`` that may be worth porting.
