Introduction
============

To make a long story short: sometimes you need to break into the debugger in the
middle of a Script (Python). To prevent the frustrating ``Unauthorized: import
of 'pdb' is unauthorized`` message, use this enablesettrace package.

This package supports importing the ``pdb`` module. It is a fork of the original
Products.enablesettrace package which still resides in the Zope Subversion
Repository. The only change made was turning the package into an egg.

It also incorporates the monkeypatch from the ``zdb`` product from Chris
Withers.


Installation
============

The installation is as simple as making sure the package is located on the
Python path. For example when you are using zc.buildout list
``Products.enablesettrace`` in the ``eggs`` section::

  [buildout]
  ...
  eggs =
      ...
      Products.enablesettrace

This code was originally contributed by Zach Bir and `committed by Jim Fulton
<http://svn.zope.org/Products.enablesettrace/trunk/__init__.py?rev=41469&r1=41469&view=log>`_.
Mark van Lent eggified the product.

Jean Jordaan snarfed Chris's code from https://github.com/Simplistix/zdb
There is more in ``zdb`` that may be worth porting.
