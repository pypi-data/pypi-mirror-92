Xpress Python interface
=======================

The Xpress Python interface is a Python module to create and solve optimization problems using the Python programming language and the [FICO Xpress](http://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization-suite) Optimizer library. The module allows for

-   Creating, handling, solving, and querying optimization problems;
-   Using Python numerical libraries such as NumPy to create optimization problems;
-   Setting and getting the value of parameters (controls and attributes) of a problem; and
-   Using Python functions as callbacks for the Xpress Optimizer and the Xpress Nonlinear solver.

The Xpress Python interface allows for creating, handling, and solving all problems that can be solved with the FICO-Xpress library: Linear Programming (LP), Quadratic Programming (QP), Second-Order Conic Programming (SOCP), and their mixed-integer extensions: MILP, MIQP, MIQCQP, MISOCP, together with general nonlinear and mixed-integer nonlinear.

Examples
--------

The following is a Optimization problem with a quadratic constraint and two variables, one of which integer:
```
min  x1^2 + 2 x2
s.t. x1 + 3 x2 >= 4
     -10 <= x1 <= 10
     x1 in Z
     x2 >= 0
```

The program can be input and solved as follows (note that all variables are assumed nonnegative):
```python
import xpress as xp
x = xp.var(vartype=xp.integer, name='x1', lb=-10, ub=10)
y = xp.var(name='x2')
p = xp.problem(name='myexample')
p.addVariable(x,y)
p.setObjective(x**2 + 2*y)
p.addConstraint(x + 3*y >= 4)
p.solve()
print ("solution: {0} = {1}; {2} = {3}".format (x.name, p.getSolution(x), y.name, p.getSolution(y)))
```

The interface allows for a more compact problem formulation where `xp.problem` is passed all components of the problem:

```python
p = xp.problem(x, y, x**2 + 2*y, x + 3*y >= 4, name='myexample')
```

Installation
------------

The Xpress Python interface can be downloaded from [PyPI](https://www.pypi.org) and from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). Run
```
pip install xpress
```

to install from PyPI, and
```
conda install -c fico-xpress xpress
```

to install from the Conda repository.

The downloaded package contains: a folder with several examples of usages of the module, with varying degrees of difficulty; a directory `license` containing the [Xpress Community License](http://subscribe.fico.com/xpress-optimization-community-license); and a directory `doc` with the manual in PDF version---the full HTML documentation for the Xpress Optimizer's library, including the Python interface with its example, is also available at the [FICO Xpress Optimization Help](http://www.fico.com/fico-xpress-optimization/docs/latest/solver/GUID-ACD7E60C-7852-36B7-A78A-CED0EA291CDD.html) page.

If you do not have any FICO Xpress license, the community license will be recognized by the module and no further action is needed. If you do have a license, for instance located in `/users/johndoe/xpauth.xpr`, make sure to set the global environment variable `XPRESS` to point to the folder containing the `xpauth.xpr` file, i.e. `XPRESS=/user/johndoe`.

Licensing
---------

The file `community-xpauth.xpr` license file in the `license` directory allows to solve problems with up to 5000 rows+columns. To obtain an unlimited license, please contact FICO at [support@fico.com](mailto:support@fico.com).  Academic licenses are also unlimited and can be obtained via the [Academic Partnership Program](http://subscribe.fico.com/Academic-Partner-Program).
