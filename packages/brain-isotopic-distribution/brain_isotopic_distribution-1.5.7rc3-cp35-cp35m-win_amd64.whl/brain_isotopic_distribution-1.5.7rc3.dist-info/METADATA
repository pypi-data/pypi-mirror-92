:mod:`brainpy` is a small Python library implementing the *B* afflingly *R* ecursive
*A* lgorithm for *I* sotopic Patter *N* generation [Dittwald2014]_. It includes three implementations,
a pure-Python object oriented implementation, a :title-reference:`Cython` accelerated
version of the object oriented implementation, and a pure :title-reference:`C` implementation,
listed in order of ascending speed. The C implementation is used by default when available.

BRAIN, implemented in :func:`brainpy.isotopic_variants`, takes an elemental
composition represented by  any :class:`~.collections.abc.Mapping`-like Python object and uses
it to compute its aggregated isotopic distribution. All isotopic variants of the same number
of neutrons are collapsed into a single centroid peak, meaning it does not consider isotopic
fine structure.

Installing
----------
:mod:`brainpy` has three implementations, a pure Python implementation, a Cython translation
of that implementation, and a pure C implementation that releases the :title-reference:`GIL`.

To install from a package index, you will need to have a C compiler appropriate to your Python
version to build these extension modules. Additionally, there are prebuilt wheels for Windows
available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/brain-isotopic-distribution/>`_:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ pip install brain-isotopic-distribution

To build from source, in addition to a C compiler you will also need to install a recent version
of `Cython <https://pypi.org/project/Cython/>`_ to transpile C code.
