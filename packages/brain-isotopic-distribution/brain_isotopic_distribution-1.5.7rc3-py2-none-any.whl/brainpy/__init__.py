    This module contains two variants of the algorithm reimplimented using C and the Python-C API.

    The `_speedup` module is a direct translation of the pure Python implementation using Cython,
    using static typing and `cdef class` versions of the existing classes. As this implementation still
    spends a substantial amount of time in Python-space, it is slower than the option below, but is more
    straight-forward to manipulate from Python.

    The `_c` module is a complete rewrite of the algorithm directly in C, using Python only to load
    mass configuration information and is fully usable. It exports an entrypoint function to Python
    which replaces the :func:`isotopic_variants` function when available. Because almost all of the
    action happens in C here, it's not possible to run individual parts of the process directly from
    Python.
