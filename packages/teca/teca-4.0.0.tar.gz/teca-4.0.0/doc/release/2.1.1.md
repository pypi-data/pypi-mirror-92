# Release Notes for TECA 2.1.1 #
Fri May 19 16:26:17 PDT 2017

* Fix CMake code that disabled tests when build features are not present
* Report map-reduce domain decomposition in verbose mode
* Fix OSX build issue
* use the cpuid instruction to detect cpu topology, physical cores
  and hyperthreads. When possible we spread thread pool over unique
  cores on a node taking into account other MPI ranks running on the
  node. When the user requests more than the number of physical cores
  available on a node, we bind to unique hyper threads. When the user
  requests more than the number of hyperthreads on the node, we bind
  to least used hyperthread. only implemented for intel.
* added verbose mode to the teca_threaded_algorithm. when enabled
  the thread to core map is printed to stderr.
* added local mode to the the teca_thread_pool. this mode prevents
  use of MPI collective operations so that a thread pool can be
  created on a single rank.
* bind_threads, and verbose options in command line.
