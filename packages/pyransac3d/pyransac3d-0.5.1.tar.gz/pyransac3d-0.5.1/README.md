## What is pyRANSAC-3D?
**_pyRANSAC-3D_** is an open source implementation of Random sample consensus (RANSAC) method. It fits primitive shapes such as planes, cuboids and cylinder in a point cloud to many aplications: 3D slam, 3D reconstruction, object tracking and many others.

#### Features:
 - [Plane](https://leomariga.github.io/pyRANSAC-3D/api-documentation/plane/)
 - [Cylinder](https://leomariga.github.io/pyRANSAC-3D/api-documentation/cylinder/)
 - [Cuboid](https://leomariga.github.io/pyRANSAC-3D/api-documentation/cuboid/)
 - [Sphere](https://leomariga.github.io/pyRANSAC-3D/api-documentation/sphere/)
 - [Line](https://leomariga.github.io/pyRANSAC-3D/api-documentation/line/)
 - [Circle](https://leomariga.github.io/pyRANSAC-3D/api-documentation/circle/)
 - [Point](https://leomariga.github.io/pyRANSAC-3D/api-documentation/point/)


## Installation
Requirements: Numpy

Install with [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pyransac3d/):

```sh
pip3 install pyransac3d
```

## Take a look: 

### Example 1 - Planar RANSAC

``` python
import pyransac3d as pyrsc

points = load_points(.) # Load your point cloud as a numpy array (N, 3)

plane1 = pyrsc.Plane()
best_eq, best_inliers = plane1.fit(points, 0.01)

```

Results in the plane equation Ax+By+Cz+D:
`[1, 0.5, 2, 0]`

### Example 2 - Spherical RANSAC

Loading a noisy sphere's point cloud with r = 5 centered in 0 we can use the following code:

``` python
import pyransac3d as pyrsc

points = load_points(.) # Load your point cloud as a numpy array (N, 3)

sph = pyrsc.Sphere()
center, radius, inliers = sph.fit(points, thresh=0.4)

```

Results:
``` python
center: [0.010462385575072288, -0.2855090643954039, 0.02867848979091283]
radius: 5.085218633039647
```

 - You can find the animations you see in the documentation on branch [Animations](https://github.com/leomariga/pyRANSAC-3D/tree/Animations). It needs [Open3D](https://github.com/intel-isl/Open3D) library to run. The Animation branch is not regularly maintained, it only exists to create some cool visualizations ;D
