        Example
        =======
        
        We provide two examples on how to use the demandlib. One for the heat sector, executable by calling ``demandlib_heat_example``, and one showing how to create electricity demand time series, executable by calling ``demandlib_power_example``. Both examples are callable from anywhere in the command-line.
