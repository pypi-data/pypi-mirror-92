Description: # microcosm-flask
        
        Opinionated Flask services.
        
        [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/globality-corp/microcosm-flask/tree/develop.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/globality-corp/microcosm-flask/tree/develop)
        
        
        ## Conventions
        
         - Classify API endpoints according to an enumerated set of operations with well-defined naming conventions
         - Handle errors consistently using a top-level error and nested sub-errrors
         - Handle UUIDs as route path keys
         - Protect endpoints with basic auth
         - Use HAL JSON links to related resources to each other
         - Use Swagger to publish endpoints for interoperability
         - Automate generation of endpoints according to conventions:
            - A health check API endpoint exposes service health
            - RESTful endpoints provide CRUD operations on resources
            - RESTful endpoints allows one resource to be related to another
            - API discovery endpoints allow resource data to be discovered/spidered
            - Swagger endpoints allow endpoint integration to be automated
        
        ## Setup
        
        Create a virtualenv
        
        ```
        mkvirtualenv microcosm-flask
        ```
        
        Install dependencies
        
        ```
        pip install -U -e .
        ```
        
        ## Tests
        
        Run the tests
        
        ```
        python setup.py nosetests
        ```
        
        
        ## Configuration
        
         - The object graph's `debug` and `testing` flags are propagated to the Flask application
